Yes, the road we are driving on is an intersection.

The image shows a car driving on a road at night. The road appears to be an intersection, as there is a stop sign on the left side of the image and a traffic light on the right side of the image. The car is driving towards the traffic light, which is red, indicating that the car must stop at the intersection. There are no other cars visible in the image, so it appears that the car is driving alone on the road.
