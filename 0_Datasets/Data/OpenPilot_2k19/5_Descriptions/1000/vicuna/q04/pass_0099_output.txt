Yes, the road we are driving on is an intersection.

The image shows a car driving on a road that intersects with another road. The car is driving on the left side of the image, and there is a building on the right side of the image. The building has a yellow sign that says "ImageContent" on it. The road appears to be a city street, with other cars and buildings visible in the background.
