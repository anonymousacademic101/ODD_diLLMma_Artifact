Yes, the road we are driving on is an intersection.

The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down a road at dusk. The road appears to run horizontally across the image, with trees on either side of it. The sky in the background is dark, with the sun setting behind the trees on the right side of the image. The car's headlights are on, illuminating the road ahead.
