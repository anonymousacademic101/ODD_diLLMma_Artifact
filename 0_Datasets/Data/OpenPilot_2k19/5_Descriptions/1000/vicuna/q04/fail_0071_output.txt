Yes, the road we are driving on is an intersection.

The image shows a gas station at night, with a car parked in front of it. The car's headlights are on, illuminating the front of the car and the gas pumps in front of it. The gas station is lit up by blue neon lights, which are reflected in the car's windshield. The road appears to be an intersection, as there is a stop sign on the left side of the image and a road sign on the right side.
