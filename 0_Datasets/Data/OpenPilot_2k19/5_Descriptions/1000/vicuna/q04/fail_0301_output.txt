Yes, the road in the image runs horizontally across the image.

The image shows a parking lot with several cars parked in it. The cars are parked in rows, with some cars facing in one direction and others facing in the opposite direction. The road running through the parking lot appears to be a continuation of the road outside the parking lot, and it runs horizontally across the image from left to right.
