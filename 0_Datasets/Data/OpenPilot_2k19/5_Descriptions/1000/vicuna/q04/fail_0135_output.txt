YES, the road we are driving on is an intersection.

The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down a road. The road appears to be an intersection, as there is a stop sign on the right side of the image and a yield sign on the left side. The road appears to run horizontally across the image, as there are trees and other buildings visible on either side of the road.
