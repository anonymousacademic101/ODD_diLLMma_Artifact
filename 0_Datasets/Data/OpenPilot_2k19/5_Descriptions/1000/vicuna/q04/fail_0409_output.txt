Yes, the road we are driving on is an intersection. The image shows a parking lot with several cars parked on the left side of the road, and a Shell gas station on the right side of the road. There is a stop sign on the left side of the road, indicating that traffic must stop before entering the parking lot. The road appears to run horizontally across the image.
