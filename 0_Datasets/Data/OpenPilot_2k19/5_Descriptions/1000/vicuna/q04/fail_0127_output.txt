Yes, the road we are driving on is an intersection.

The image shows a car driving through a tunnel at night. The car's headlights illuminate the road ahead, revealing that it is an intersection. There are no other vehicles visible in the image, so it is safe to assume that the car is the only one on the road at that time. The road appears to be straight and level, running horizontally across the image. There are no visible road markings or signs to indicate the direction of the road or any upcoming intersections. The darkness of the tunnel and the lack of other visual cues make it difficult to determine the exact location of the car or the direction it is heading.
