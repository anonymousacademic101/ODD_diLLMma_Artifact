Yes, the road we are driving on is an intersection.

The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down a road. The road appears to be a city street with buildings on either side and cars parked on the side of the road. In the distance, we can see a stop sign and a crosswalk. The road appears to be a T-intersection, meaning that it intersects with another road at a right angle.
