Yes, the road we are driving on is an intersection. The image shows a car driving on a road that appears to be an intersection, as there is a stop sign on the left side of the image and a crosswalk on the right side of the image. Additionally, there is a building in the background on the left side of the image, which suggests that the road runs horizontally across the image.
