Yes, the road we are driving on is an intersection.

The image shows a parking lot with several cars parked in it. The cars are parked in rows, with some cars facing in one direction and others facing in the opposite direction. There is a building in the background on the right side of the image, which appears to be a shopping center or restaurant. The sky is cloudy and overcast, and there are no other vehicles visible in the image.
