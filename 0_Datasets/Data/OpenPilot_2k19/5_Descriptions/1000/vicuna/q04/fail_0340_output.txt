Yes, the road we are driving on is an intersection.

The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving on a road that intersects with another road. There are several cars parked on the side of the road, and some are driving on the road. The road appears to run horizontally across the image, as there are buildings and other structures visible on both sides of the road.
