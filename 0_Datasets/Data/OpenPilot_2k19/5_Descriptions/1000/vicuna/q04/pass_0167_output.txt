The road we are driving on is an intersection.


The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car traveling on a road at night. The road appears to be an intersection, as there are multiple roads intersecting with the one the car is on, and there are traffic lights controlling the flow of traffic. The lights are red, indicating that the car needs to stop, and there are other cars waiting at the intersection.
