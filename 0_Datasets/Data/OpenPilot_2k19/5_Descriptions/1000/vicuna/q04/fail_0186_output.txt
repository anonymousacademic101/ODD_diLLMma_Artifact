Yes, the road we are driving on is an intersection.

The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving on a road under a bridge. The road appears to run horizontally across the image, with trees and buildings visible on either side. The bridge appears to be an overpass, as it is elevated above the road and cars can be seen driving under it.
