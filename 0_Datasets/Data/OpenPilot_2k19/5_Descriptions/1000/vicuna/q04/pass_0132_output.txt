YES, the road we are driving on is an intersection.

The image shows a car driving on a road at night. The car is driving on the left side of the road, and there are other cars driving in the opposite direction on the right side of the road. There are streetlights on both sides of the road, and the headlights of the car are illuminating the road ahead. The trees on either side of the road are bare, and there are no buildings or other structures visible in the image.
