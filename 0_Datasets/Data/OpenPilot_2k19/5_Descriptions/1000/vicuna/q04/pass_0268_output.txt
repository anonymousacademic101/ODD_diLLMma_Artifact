Yes, the road we are driving on is an intersection.

The image shows a road that runs horizontally across the image, with trees on either side of the road. The road appears to be a two-lane highway, with a center line dividing the lanes. On the left side of the road, there is a shoulder, and on the right side, there is a guardrail. The road appears to be straight and level, with no significant changes in elevation. There are no vehicles visible on the road, but there are some parked cars on the side of the road.
