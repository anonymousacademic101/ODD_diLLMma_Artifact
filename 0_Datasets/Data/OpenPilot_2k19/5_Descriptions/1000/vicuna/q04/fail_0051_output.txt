Yes, the road we are driving on is an intersection.

The image shows a car parked on the side of the road next to a building with a sign that says "ImageContent". The building appears to be a store or restaurant, and there is a parking lot in front of it with several other cars parked. The road appears to run horizontally across the image, and there is a sidewalk on the other side of the road.
