No, the road we are driving on is not hilly.

The image shows a car parked on the side of a road in front of a building. The building appears to be a store or restaurant, as there is a sign hanging above the entrance that says "Subway" and there are tables and chairs outside the building. The car is parked on the right side of the road, facing in the opposite direction of the camera. The road appears to be straight and level.
