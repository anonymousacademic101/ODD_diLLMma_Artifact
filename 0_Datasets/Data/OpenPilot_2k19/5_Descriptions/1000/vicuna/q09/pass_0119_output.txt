Yes, the road we are driving on is hilly.

The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down a hilly road at night. The headlights of the car illuminate the road ahead, revealing the uneven terrain. The road appears to be winding and narrow, with trees and other obstacles on either side. The car's headlights also reveal the presence of other vehicles on the road, including a truck in front of the car and a car behind it. The image is taken at night, and the sky is dark, with only the light from the car's headlights illuminating the scene.
