Yes, the road we are driving on is hilly.

The image shows a car driving down a hilly road at night, with the headlights illuminating the road ahead. The road appears to be winding and narrow, with trees and other obstacles on either side. The car's headlights cast long shadows on the ground, indicating the steepness of the incline. The darkness of the night and the lack of other vehicles on the road suggest that this is a remote or isolated location.
