Yes, the road we are driving on is hilly.

The image shows a car driving on a hilly road in front of a store. The car is parked on the side of the road, and there is a stop sign in front of it. The store has a sign that says "ImageContent" on it, and there are several other cars parked in front of it. The road appears to be winding and hilly, with trees and buildings visible in the background.
