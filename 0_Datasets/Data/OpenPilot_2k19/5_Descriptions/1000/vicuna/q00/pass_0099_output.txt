Yes, the image has poor visibility due to the heavy rain.

The image shows a car driving on a wet road with heavy rain falling from the sky. The visibility is poor due to the rain, making it difficult for the driver to see the road ahead. The car's windshield wipers are working hard to clear the water from the windshield, but it is still difficult to see through the rain. The image also shows a sign on the building in the background, but it is not clear what it says due to the poor visibility.
