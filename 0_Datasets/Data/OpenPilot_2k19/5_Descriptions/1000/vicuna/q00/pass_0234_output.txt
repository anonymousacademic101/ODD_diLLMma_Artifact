The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car traveling on a city street during rush hour. The street is congested with a lot of traffic, including cars, trucks, and buses. The weather appears to be cloudy, but it is not clear if it is raining or snowing.

Based on the image, it is difficult to determine if there is poor visibility due to adverse weather conditions. However, it is possible that the visibility is poor due to the cloudy weather, which can make it difficult to see other vehicles and pedestrians on the road. Additionally, the heavy traffic could also contribute to poor visibility.
