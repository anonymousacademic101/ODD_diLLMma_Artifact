The image shows a building with a purple and white exterior and a large glass window. It appears to be a store or business of some kind. It is difficult to determine whether the visibility is poor or not based on this image alone. It is possible that the glass window allows for good visibility inside the building, but it is also possible that the weather outside is affecting visibility.
