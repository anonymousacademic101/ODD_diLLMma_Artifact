The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving on a highway at night. There are other cars on the road, and their headlights and taillights are visible in the distance. The road appears to be straight and well-lit, with streetlights on either side. It is difficult to determine whether the visibility is poor or not, as the image does not show any adverse weather conditions such as heavy rain, snow, or fog.
