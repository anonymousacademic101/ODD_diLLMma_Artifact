Yes, this image has poor visibility due to the heavy rain.

The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down a city street at night. The street is lined with streetlights, but they are not bright enough to illuminate the road. The headlights of the car are on, but they do not provide enough light to see the road clearly. The visibility is poor due to the heavy rain that is falling, making it difficult to see the road and other vehicles.
