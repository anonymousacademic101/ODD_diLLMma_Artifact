The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving on a road with a bridge in the background. The visibility is poor due to fog, which makes it difficult to see the road ahead and the surroundings. The driver may need to use the windshield wipers to clear the fog from the windshield and rely on other cues such as the side mirrors and the GPS system to navigate the road.
