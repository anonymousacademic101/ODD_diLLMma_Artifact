Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down a city street at night. The street is lined with streetlights and trees, and there are cars driving in both directions on the road. The car's headlights illuminate the road ahead, and the taillights illuminate the road behind. The driver's view is through the windshield, which is tinted darkly to reduce glare from the headlights of oncoming cars. The steering wheel and dashboard are visible in the foreground, with the gearshift and other controls within easy reach of the driver's hands.
