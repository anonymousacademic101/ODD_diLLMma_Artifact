Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving on a road. The road appears to be an on-off ramp, as there is a sign indicating that it is an on-ramp to the right, and a sign indicating that it is an off-ramp to the left. The trees on the side of the road and the buildings in the distance can be seen through the windshield of the car.
