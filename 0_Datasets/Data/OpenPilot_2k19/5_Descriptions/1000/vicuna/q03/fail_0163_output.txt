Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down a road. The road appears to be an on-off ramp, as there is a solid white line on the right side of the road, and a dashed line on the left side of the road. The road appears to be going down a hill, and there are trees and other vegetation on both sides of the road. The sky appears to be clear and blue.
