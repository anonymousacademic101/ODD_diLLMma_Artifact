Yes, the road we are driving on appears to be an on-off ramp.

The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving on a road that appears to be an on-off ramp. The road is lined with trees on both sides and there is a guardrail separating the on-ramp from the main road. The sky is cloudy and there are buildings visible in the distance.
