Yes, the road in the image appears to be an on-off ramp.

The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down a city street. The street is lined with buildings on both sides and there are several cars driving in the same direction as the car in the image. The road appears to be an on-off ramp, as there is a sign for an on-ramp to a freeway visible in the distance, and the road seems to be merging into another road that continues straight ahead.
