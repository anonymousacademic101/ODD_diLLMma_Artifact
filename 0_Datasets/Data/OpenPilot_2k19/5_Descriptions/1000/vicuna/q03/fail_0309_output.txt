Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The on-off ramp is a type of road that allows vehicles to enter or exit a controlled-access highway, such as a freeway or motorway. On-off ramps are typically located at interchanges, where two or more highways meet. They are designed to provide a safe and efficient way for vehicles to enter or exit the highway, while minimizing the impact on traffic flow.

On-off ramps typically have two lanes: one for vehicles entering the highway, and one for vehicles exiting the highway. They may also have acceleration and deceleration lanes, which allow vehicles to build up or lose speed before entering or exiting the highway.

On-off ramps are important for maintaining the flow of traffic on controlled-access highways, as they allow vehicles to enter and exit the highway without disrupting the flow of traffic on the main lanes. They also help to reduce congestion and improve safety by providing a designated area for vehicles to enter and exit the highway.
