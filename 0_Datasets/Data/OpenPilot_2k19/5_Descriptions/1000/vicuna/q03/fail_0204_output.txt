NO, the road we are driving on is not an on-off ramp.

Explanation: An on-off ramp is a road that connects a highway or freeway to another road, allowing vehicles to enter or exit the highway or freeway. The image provided does not show a road that connects to a highway or freeway, but rather a parking lot with several cars parked in it.
