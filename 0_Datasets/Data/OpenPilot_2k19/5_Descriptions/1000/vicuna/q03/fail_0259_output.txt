No, the road we are driving on is not an on-off ramp.

The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down a street at night. The building on the right side of the image appears to be a convenience store or fast food restaurant, with a sign that reads "McDonald's" above the entrance. There are no visible on-off ramps in the image.
