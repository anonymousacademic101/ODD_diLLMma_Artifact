Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The on-off ramp is a road that allows vehicles to enter or exit a controlled-access highway, such as a freeway or motorway. The on-ramp is where vehicles can enter the highway, while the off-ramp is where vehicles can exit the highway. In the image, we can see several cars driving on the on-off ramp, which suggests that it is being used by vehicles to enter or exit the controlled-access highway.
