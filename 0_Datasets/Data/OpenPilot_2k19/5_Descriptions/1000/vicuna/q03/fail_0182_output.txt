Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car traveling on a road that appears to be an on-off ramp. The road has a steep incline and is lined with trees on either side. There is a yellow line down the center of the road, and a green sign with an arrow pointing to the right is visible in the distance.
