Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The on-off ramp is a part of a highway that allows vehicles to enter or exit the highway. It is typically located at an interchange, where multiple highways or roads converge. The on-off ramp allows drivers to enter or exit the highway safely and efficiently, without having to merge with traffic on the main lanes of the highway.
