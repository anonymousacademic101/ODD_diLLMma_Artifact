Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a car parked on the side of the road next to a building with a sign that says "ImageContent". The building appears to be a store or business, and there is a parking lot in front of it. The car is parked at an angle, with one of its wheels on the curb. There are no other cars visible in the image, and the road appears to be empty.
