Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down a road with buildings on either side. The road appears to be an on-off ramp, as there is a divider in the middle of the road and cars are driving on it in both directions. The buildings on either side of the road appear to be residential, with windows and balconies visible. There are also trees and greenery visible on either side of the road.
