Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a parking lot with several cars parked in it. There is a barrier in the middle of the parking lot that separates the parking spaces from the road. The road appears to be an on-off ramp, as there is a sign indicating that it is an entrance to the parking lot. The cars are parked in a haphazard manner, with some cars facing in one direction and others facing in the opposite direction. The parking lot appears to be empty, with no people or other vehicles in sight. The sky is cloudy and overcast, which gives the image a gloomy feel.
