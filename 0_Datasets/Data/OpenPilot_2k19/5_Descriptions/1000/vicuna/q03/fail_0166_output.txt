Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a road with a yellow line in the middle, which is a dividing line between the on-ramp and the main road. There are trees on both sides of the road and a power line running along the side of the road. The road appears to be an on-off ramp, as there is a stop sign on the left side of the image and a yield sign on the right side, indicating that traffic on the on-ramp must yield to traffic on the main road.
