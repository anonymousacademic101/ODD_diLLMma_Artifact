Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a parking lot with several cars parked in it. The cars are parked in rows, with some cars facing forward and some facing backward. The cars are parked close to each other, leaving little space between them. The parking lot appears to be empty, with no people or other vehicles in sight. The sky is cloudy, and it seems to be a dull, overcast day. The image is taken from a driver's perspective, looking out the front windshield of a car.
