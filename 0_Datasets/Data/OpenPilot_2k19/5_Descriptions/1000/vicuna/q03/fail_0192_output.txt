Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving on a road under an overpass. The road appears to be an on-off ramp, as there is a sign indicating the lane is for merging onto the highway. The overpass appears to be made of concrete and has several support columns. The road surface is asphalt, and there are no visible lane markings or other road signs. The view is clear, with no obstructions or other vehicles in the frame.
