Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving on a road next to a building. The road appears to be an on-off ramp, as there is a sign indicating that it is an entrance to a parking lot, and there is a line of parked cars on the right side of the road. The building in the background appears to be a commercial establishment, with a sign indicating that it is a pharmacy.
