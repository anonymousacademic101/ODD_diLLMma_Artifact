Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving on a road at night. The road appears to be an on-off ramp, as there is a divider in the middle of the road and cars are driving on it in both directions. The cars are driving on the right side of the road, which is typical for the United States and other countries that drive on the right side of the road. There are streetlights on both sides of the road, providing illumination for the cars driving on it.
