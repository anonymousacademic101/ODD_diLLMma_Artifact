Yes, the road we are driving on appears to be an on-off ramp.

The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving on a road that appears to be an on-off ramp. The road has a concrete surface and is bordered by a guardrail. On the left side of the road, there are several cars driving in the same direction as the car in the image. On the right side of the road, there is a divider separating the on-ramp from the main road. The sky appears to be clear and blue, and there are no buildings or other structures visible in the image.
