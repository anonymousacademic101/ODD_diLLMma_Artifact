Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a parking lot with cars parked in it, and a road running through the middle of the lot. The road appears to be an on-off ramp, as it has a solid yellow line down the middle, indicating that it is a one-way road, and there are arrows pointing in both directions, indicating that cars can enter and exit the parking lot from this road. Additionally, there are no other roads visible in the image, suggesting that this is the only way to access the parking lot.
