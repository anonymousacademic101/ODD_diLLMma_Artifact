Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The on-off ramp is a part of a highway that allows vehicles to enter or exit the highway. It is typically located at an interchange, where multiple highways or roads converge. On-off ramps are designed to allow vehicles to smoothly enter or exit the highway, reducing the risk of accidents and congestion on the road.
