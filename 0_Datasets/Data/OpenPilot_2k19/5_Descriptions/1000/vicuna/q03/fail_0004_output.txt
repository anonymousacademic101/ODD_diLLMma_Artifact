Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a McDonald's restaurant with a drive-thru window. The drive-thru window is an on-off ramp that allows vehicles to enter and exit the drive-thru lane. The on-off ramp is made of concrete and has a yellow divider in the middle to separate the drive-thru lane from the parking lot. The yellow divider is a safety measure to prevent vehicles from accidentally entering the parking lot while using the drive-thru lane.

The image also shows a parking lot with several cars parked in it. The parking lot is an off-ramp from the drive-thru lane, allowing customers to park their vehicles and enter the restaurant through the main entrance. The parking lot is paved with asphalt and has lines marking the parking spaces.

Overall, the image shows a typical McDonald's restaurant with a drive-thru window and a parking lot.
