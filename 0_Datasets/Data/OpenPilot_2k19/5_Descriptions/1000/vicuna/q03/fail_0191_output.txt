Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving on a road with a bridge in the background. The road appears to be an on-off ramp, as there is a sign indicating the direction of traffic and a lane divider separating the on-ramp from the main road. Additionally, there is a guardrail on the side of the road, which is a common feature on on-off ramps.
