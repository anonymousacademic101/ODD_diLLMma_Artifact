Yes, the road in the image appears to be an on-off ramp. The cars are parked on the right side of the road, and there is a solid line on the left side of the road, indicating that it is an on-off ramp. Additionally, there is a sign on the left side of the road that says "Exit Only," which further supports the idea that this is an on-off ramp.
