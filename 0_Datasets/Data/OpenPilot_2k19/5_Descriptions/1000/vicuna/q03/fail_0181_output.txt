Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving on a road that appears to be an on-off ramp. The road has a yellow line down the middle, and there are trees on either side of the road. The road seems to be going uphill, and there is a signpost on the left side of the road that says "Highway 1" and an arrow pointing to the right.
