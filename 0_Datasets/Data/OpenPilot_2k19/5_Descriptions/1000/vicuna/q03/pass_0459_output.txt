Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The on-off ramp is a road that allows vehicles to enter or exit a highway or freeway. It is typically located at the end of a highway or freeway, where it intersects with a local road or street. On-off ramps are designed to provide a smooth and safe transition between the highway or freeway and the local road or street, allowing drivers to merge onto or off the highway or freeway without disrupting the flow of traffic.
