Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving on a road next to a building. The road appears to be an on-off ramp, as there are cars parked on the right side of the road, and there is a white line separating the on-ramp from the main road. The building in the background appears to be a commercial or industrial property, with large windows and a white facade.
