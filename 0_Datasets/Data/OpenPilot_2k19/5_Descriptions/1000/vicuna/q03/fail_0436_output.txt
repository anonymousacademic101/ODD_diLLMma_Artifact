Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a road that appears to be an on-off ramp, with a concrete overpass above it. The road seems to be a continuation of the street that is visible in the background, and it appears to be merging with another road that is not visible in the image. There are no visible signs indicating whether the road is an on-ramp or an off-ramp, but it is likely an on-ramp since it appears to be merging with another road.
