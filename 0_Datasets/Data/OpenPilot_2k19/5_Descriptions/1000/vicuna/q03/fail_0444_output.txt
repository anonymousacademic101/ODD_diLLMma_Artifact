Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving on a road that appears to be an on-off ramp. The road is lined with trees on both sides and there are other cars driving on the road in the same direction as the car in the image. The road appears to be an on-off ramp because there is a solid white line on the right side of the road, indicating that it is an on-ramp, and there is a dashed white line on the left side of the road, indicating that it is an off-ramp.
