Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a parking lot with several cars parked in it. There is a building in the background with a purple sign that says "ImageContent" on it. The road in front of the building appears to be an on-off ramp, as there are arrows indicating the direction of traffic and a lane that appears to be for entering and exiting the parking lot.
