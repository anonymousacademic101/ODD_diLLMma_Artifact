Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The on-off ramp is a type of road that allows vehicles to enter or exit a controlled-access highway, such as a freeway or motorway. On-off ramps are typically located at interchanges, where two or more highways meet. They are designed to provide a safe and efficient way for vehicles to enter or exit the highway while minimizing the impact on traffic flow.

On-off ramps typically have their own lane, separated from the through lanes of the highway. Vehicles entering or exiting the highway use this lane to merge with the traffic on the highway or to exit the highway completely. The on-off ramp is designed to allow vehicles to enter or exit the highway at a controlled speed and in a safe manner, without disrupting the flow of traffic on the highway.

Overall, on-off ramps are an important feature of controlled-access highways, as they provide a convenient and safe way for vehicles to enter or exit the highway while minimizing the impact on traffic flow.
