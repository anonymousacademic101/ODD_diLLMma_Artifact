Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The on-off ramp is a road that connects a highway or other major road to a smaller road or local street, allowing vehicles to enter or exit the highway or road without having to merge with traffic on the main road. On-off ramps are commonly found at interchanges, where multiple highways or roads intersect.
