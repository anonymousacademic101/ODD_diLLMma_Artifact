Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a car driving on a road that appears to be an on-off ramp, as there is a concrete divider in the middle of the road and a sign indicating that it is an on-ramp. The car is driving towards the camera, which is positioned on the side of the road, and there are buildings and other vehicles visible in the background.
