Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving on a road that appears to be an on-off ramp. The road is lined with trees and shrubs on both sides, and there is a yellow sign with an arrow pointing to the right on the left side of the road. The building on the right side of the road has a sign that reads "Shell" in red letters. The image is taken from the driver's perspective, with the windshield and the hood of the car visible in the foreground, and the road and the building in the background.
