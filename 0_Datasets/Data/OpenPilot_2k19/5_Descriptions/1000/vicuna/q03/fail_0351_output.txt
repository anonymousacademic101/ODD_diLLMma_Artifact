Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down a road with trees on both sides. The road appears to be an on-off ramp, as there is a solid white line on the right side of the road and a dashed white line on the left side of the road, indicating that vehicles can exit the road on the left side, but not enter it from the left. Additionally, there is a sign on the right side of the road that says "Exit Only" which further supports the idea that this is an on-off ramp.
