Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down a road with trees on either side. The road appears to be an on-off ramp, as there is a solid white line on the right side of the road and a dashed line on the left side, indicating that traffic can enter or exit the road but not travel in both directions at the same time. Additionally, there are no other vehicles visible in the image, which suggests that the road is not a through-road.
