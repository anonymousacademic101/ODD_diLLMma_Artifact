Yes, the road in the image appears to be an on-off ramp.

The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving on a road that appears to be an on-off ramp. The road has two lanes, one for traffic going straight and one for traffic turning right. There is a concrete barrier in the middle of the road, separating the two lanes. On the left side of the road, there is a line of cars waiting to turn right. On the right side of the road, there is a line of cars driving straight.

The road appears to be an on-off ramp because it has the characteristics of an on-ramp, which is a road that allows vehicles to enter or exit a controlled-access highway. On-ramps typically have two lanes, one for traffic entering the highway and one for traffic exiting the highway. The concrete barrier in the middle of the road is also a characteristic of an on-ramp, as it is used to separate the two lanes and control the flow of traffic.
