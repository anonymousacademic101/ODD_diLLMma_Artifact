Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The on-off ramp is a section of a highway that allows vehicles to enter or exit the highway. It is typically located at an interchange, where multiple highways or roads converge. On-off ramps are designed to allow vehicles to smoothly enter or exit the highway without disrupting the flow of traffic on the main road. They typically have a steep incline or decline to help vehicles gain or lose speed as they enter or exit the highway.
