Yes, the road in the image appears to be an on-off ramp.

The image shows a view from a car driving on a road that appears to be an on-off ramp. On the left side of the road, there are trees and buildings, while on the right side, there are more buildings and a church steeple can be seen in the distance. The road appears to be a two-lane road with a median in the middle, and there are traffic lights on the left side of the road.

Based on the image, it can be inferred that the road is an on-off ramp because it appears to be connecting a major road or highway to a smaller road or local street. The presence of traffic lights and the median in the middle of the road also suggest that it is an on-off ramp.
