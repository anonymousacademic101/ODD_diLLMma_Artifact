Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving on a road that appears to be an on-off ramp. There are two lanes, one for traffic going straight and one for traffic turning left or right. The road is divided by a double yellow line, and there are streetlights on both sides of the road. There is a building on the right side of the road, which appears to be a restaurant or store.
