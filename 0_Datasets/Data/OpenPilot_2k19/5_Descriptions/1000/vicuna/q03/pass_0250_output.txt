Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving on a road with trees on both sides. The road appears to be an on-off ramp, as there is a traffic light controlling the flow of traffic on the road, and there are cars driving in both directions on the road. The road appears to be a city street, with buildings and other structures visible in the background.
