Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving on a road that appears to be an on-off ramp. The road has a yellow sign with an upward arrow pointing to the right and a downward arrow pointing to the left, indicating that traffic can enter or exit the road in either direction. The road also has a solid white line down the middle, which separates the two lanes of traffic. There are trees and greenery visible on both sides of the road, and in the distance, there is a hill with houses on it.
