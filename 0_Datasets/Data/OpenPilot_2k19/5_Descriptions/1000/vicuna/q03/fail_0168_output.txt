Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down a road with trees on both sides. The road appears to be an on-off ramp, as there is a sign indicating that it is an on-ramp to the right, and a sign indicating that it is an off-ramp to the left. There are also cars driving on the road in both directions.
