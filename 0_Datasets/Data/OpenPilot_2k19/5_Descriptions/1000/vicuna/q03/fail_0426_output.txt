Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down a road with buildings on either side. The road appears to be an on-off ramp, as there is a divider in the middle of the road and cars are driving on it in both directions. The buildings on either side of the road suggest that it is a city street.
