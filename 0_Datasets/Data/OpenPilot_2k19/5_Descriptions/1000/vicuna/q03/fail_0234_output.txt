Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving on a road at night. The road appears to be an on-off ramp, as there is a divider in the middle of the road, and there are arrows pointing in different directions. The road also has lane markings and streetlights, which can be seen in the reflection of the car's windshield.
