YES, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down a road with trees and buildings on either side. The road appears to be an on-off ramp, as there is a dashed line on the right side of the road and a solid line on the left side of the road, indicating that traffic can enter or exit the road but not travel straight through it. Additionally, there are signs on the left side of the road indicating the direction of the on-off ramp.
