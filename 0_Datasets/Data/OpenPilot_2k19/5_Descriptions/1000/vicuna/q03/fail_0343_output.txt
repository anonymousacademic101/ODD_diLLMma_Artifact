Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving on a road that appears to be an on-off ramp. There are several parked cars on the right side of the road, and a line of cars waiting to turn onto the on-ramp. The road appears to be elevated, with trees and buildings visible in the background.
