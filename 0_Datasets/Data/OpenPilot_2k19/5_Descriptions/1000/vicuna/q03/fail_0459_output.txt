Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The on-off ramp is a type of road that allows vehicles to enter or exit a controlled-access highway, such as a freeway or motorway. On-off ramps are typically located at intersections with other roads or highways, and they allow drivers to enter or exit the controlled-access highway safely and efficiently.

On-off ramps typically have traffic signals or signs that indicate when it is safe for vehicles to enter or exit the controlled-access highway. They also often have lane markings and other pavement markings to guide drivers and help them navigate the ramp safely.

Overall, on-off ramps are an important feature of controlled-access highways, as they allow drivers to easily enter or exit the highway while minimizing the risk of accidents or collisions.
