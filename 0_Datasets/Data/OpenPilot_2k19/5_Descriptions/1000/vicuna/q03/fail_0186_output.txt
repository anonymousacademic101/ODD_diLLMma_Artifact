Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving on a road under a bridge. The road appears to be an on-off ramp, as there is a barrier in the middle of the road and cars are driving on it in both directions. The bridge is visible in the background, and there are trees and other buildings on either side of the road.
