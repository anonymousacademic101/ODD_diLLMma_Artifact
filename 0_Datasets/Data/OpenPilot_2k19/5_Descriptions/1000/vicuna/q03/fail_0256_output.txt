Yes, the road in the image appears to be an on-off ramp.

The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving on a road at night. The road appears to be an on-off ramp, as there is a divider in the middle of the road and cars are driving on it in both directions. There are also streetlights on either side of the road, which illuminate the area. The image also shows a sign on the right side of the road that says "Motel" and another sign on the left side that is not visible in the image.
