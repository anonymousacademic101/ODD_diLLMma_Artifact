Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a road that appears to be an on-off ramp, with a concrete overpass in the background and trees on either side of the road. The road appears to be a continuation of the road on the other side of the overpass, which suggests that it is an on-off ramp. Additionally, there is a traffic signal on the right side of the road, indicating that it is a controlled intersection.
