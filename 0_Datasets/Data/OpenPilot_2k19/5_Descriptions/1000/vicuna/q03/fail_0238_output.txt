YES, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving on a road at night. The road appears to be an on-off ramp, as there are signs indicating the direction of the on-ramp and the off-ramp, and there is a divider separating the on-ramp from the main road. The road is illuminated by streetlights, and there are other vehicles on the road, including a truck in front of the car in the image.
