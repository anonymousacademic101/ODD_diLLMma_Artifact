Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a view from inside a car driving on a road at night. The road appears to be an on-off ramp, as there is a divider in the middle of the road and cars are driving on it in both directions. The cars are driving with their headlights on, illuminating the road ahead. There are streetlights on the sides of the road, casting a yellow glow on the surroundings. The image is taken from the perspective of someone sitting in the back seat of the car, looking forward through the windshield.
