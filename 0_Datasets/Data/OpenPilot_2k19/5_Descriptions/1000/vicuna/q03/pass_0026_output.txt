Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving on a highway with multiple lanes. The road appears to be an on-off ramp as there are signs indicating the direction of the on-ramp and off-ramp, and there is a divider separating the on-ramp from the other lanes of traffic. Additionally, there are overhead signs indicating the direction of the on-ramp and off-ramp.
