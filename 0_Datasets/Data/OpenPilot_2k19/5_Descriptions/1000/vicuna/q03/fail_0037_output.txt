NO, the road we are driving on is not an on-off ramp.

Explanation: An on-off ramp is a type of road that allows vehicles to enter or exit a controlled-access highway, such as a freeway or motorway. The road in the image does not appear to be a controlled-access highway, as there are no barriers or dividers separating the road from the sidewalk or other areas. Additionally, there are no signs indicating that this is an on-off ramp.
