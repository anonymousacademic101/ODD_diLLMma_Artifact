Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down a residential street. The street is lined with trees on both sides and there are houses on either side of the street. There is a parked car on the right side of the road and a driveway leading to a garage on the left side of the road. The road appears to be an on-off ramp, as there is a sign indicating that it is a one-way street and cars are driving in the opposite direction of the flow of traffic.
