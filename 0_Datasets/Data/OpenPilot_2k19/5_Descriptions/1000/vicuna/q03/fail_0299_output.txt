Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a parking lot with several cars parked in it. The cars are parked in such a way that they are not blocking any other cars from entering or leaving the parking lot. There are no other vehicles on the road, so it appears to be an on-off ramp.
