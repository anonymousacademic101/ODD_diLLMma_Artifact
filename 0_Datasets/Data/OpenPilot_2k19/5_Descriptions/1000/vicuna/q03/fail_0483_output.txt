Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The on-off ramp is a road that allows vehicles to enter or exit a highway or other major road. It is typically located at the side of the road and has its own lane, separated from the main road by a barrier or guardrail. On-off ramps are used to control the flow of traffic and ensure the safety of drivers and pedestrians.
