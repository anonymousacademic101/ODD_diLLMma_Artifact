Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving on a road that appears to be an on-off ramp. The road has a yellow line down the middle, and there are trees and other greenery on either side of the road. There is a signpost on the right side of the road, but it is not visible in the image. The road appears to be straight and level, with no visible inclines or declines.
