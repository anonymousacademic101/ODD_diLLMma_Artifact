Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving on a road that appears to be an on-off ramp. The road has a yellow dividing line in the middle, and there is a guardrail on the left side of the road. There are trees and shrubs on both sides of the road, and a fence can be seen in the distance.
