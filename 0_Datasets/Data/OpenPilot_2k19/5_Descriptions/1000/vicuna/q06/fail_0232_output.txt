Yes, there is construction on the road we are driving on.

The image shows a car parked in front of a store at night. The store has a sign that says "Walgreens" on it, indicating that it is a Walgreens pharmacy. There are no construction vehicles or workers visible in the image, so it appears that the construction is not affecting the area where the car is parked.
