Yes, there is construction on the road we are driving on.

The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving on a highway at dusk. The road appears to have two lanes in each direction, with a divider in the middle, and there are streetlights on either side of the road. There is construction visible on the right side of the road, with cones and barriers blocking off part of the lane.
