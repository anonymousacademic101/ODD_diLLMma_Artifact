Yes, there is construction on the road we are driving on.

The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down a city street at night. The street is lined with streetlights and trees, and there are cars and trucks driving in both directions. The road appears to be under construction, with orange cones and barriers lining the sides of the road, and there are workers in orange vests directing traffic. The view is dark, with the headlights of the car illuminating the road ahead.
