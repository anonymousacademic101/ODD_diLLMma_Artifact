Yes, there is construction on the road we are driving on.

The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down a highway at night. The highway is lit up by streetlights and there are buildings and trees on either side of the road. There is construction taking place on the right side of the road, with cones and barriers blocking off part of the lane. The car's headlights are illuminating the road ahead, and there are other vehicles driving in the same direction in the distance.
