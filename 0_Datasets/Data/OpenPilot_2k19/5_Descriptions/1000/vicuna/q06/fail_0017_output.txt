No, there is no construction on the road we are driving on.

The image shows a street view of a building with a sign on it that says 'Shell' in red letters. The building appears to be a gas station. There are no construction signs or barriers visible in the image. The road appears to be clear and there are no vehicles parked on the side of the road.
