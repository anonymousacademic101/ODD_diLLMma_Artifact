Yes, there is construction on the road we are driving on.

The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down a city street at night. The street is lined with streetlights and trees, and there are buildings on either side of the road. It appears that there is construction taking place on the road, as there are orange cones and barriers blocking off part of the lane. The car's headlights are illuminating the road ahead, and there are other vehicles on the road, including a truck in front of us and a few cars behind us.
