Yes, the road we are driving on has construction.

The image shows a car driving on a road at night with streetlights on either side of the road. The road appears to be under construction, as there are construction barriers and cones on either side of the road. The car's headlights are illuminating the road ahead, and there are other cars driving in the opposite direction. The image was taken from the perspective of someone driving in the car, looking out the front windshield.
