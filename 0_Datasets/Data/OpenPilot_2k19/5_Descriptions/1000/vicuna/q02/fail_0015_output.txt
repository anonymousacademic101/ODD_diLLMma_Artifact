Yes, the road we are driving on is a sharp curve.

The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down a road with buildings on either side. The road appears to be a sharp curve, as the buildings on the right side of the image appear to be leaning inward towards the center of the curve. The buildings on the left side of the image appear to be straight and perpendicular to the road. The sky in the background is clear and blue, and there are no other vehicles visible on the road.
