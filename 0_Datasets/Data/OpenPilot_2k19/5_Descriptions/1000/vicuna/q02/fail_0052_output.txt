No, the road we are driving on is not a sharp curve.

The image shows a car driving on a straight road in front of a building. The car is parked on the side of the road, and there is a bicycle rack next to it. The building in the background appears to be a store or restaurant, with a sign that reads "ImageContent" above the entrance. There are no visible road markings or signs that indicate a sharp curve in the road.
