This image shows a gas station at night. The gas station is a blue and white building with a sign that reads "Gas" in white letters. The gas pumps are on the left side of the building, and there are several cars parked at the pumps. The road in front of the gas station is empty, and there are no pedestrians or other vehicles visible. The time of day is night, and the lighting is provided by blue neon lights on the sign and the pumps. The image was taken from the driver's perspective, looking out the front windshield of a car.
