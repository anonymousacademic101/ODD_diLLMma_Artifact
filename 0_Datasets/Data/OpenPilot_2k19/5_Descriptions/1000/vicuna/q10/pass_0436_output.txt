This is a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down a highway. The road is straight and there are no turns in sight. The speed limit sign shows 65 mph. There are no other vehicles on the road, but there are some pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The sky is clear and blue, and there are no clouds in the sky. It appears to be a sunny day.
