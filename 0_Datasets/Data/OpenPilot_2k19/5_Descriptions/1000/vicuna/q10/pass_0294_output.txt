This image shows a view from inside a car driving down a highway at night. The road is straight and wide, with two lanes in each direction. The road is illuminated by streetlights, which are mounted on poles along the side of the road. There are no other vehicles visible in the image, but there are several pedestrians walking on the sidewalk next to the road. The time of day is night, as the sky is dark and there are no visible stars. The image was taken from the driver's perspective, looking through the windshield of the car.
