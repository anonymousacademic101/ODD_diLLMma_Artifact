The car's headlights illuminate the road ahead, and the taillights illuminate the road behind. There are no other cars visible in the image, but there are pedestrians on the sidewalk. The time of day is night, and the lighting is provided by the streetlights and the car's headlights. The driver should pay attention to the road ahead and the pedestrians on the sidewalk.
