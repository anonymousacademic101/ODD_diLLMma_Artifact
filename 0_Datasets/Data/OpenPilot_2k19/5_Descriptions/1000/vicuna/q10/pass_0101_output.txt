This image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car parked in front of a convenience store. The store has large white doors with black lettering on them that read "7-ELEVEN" in bold red letters. The car is a silver sedan with tinted windows and a license plate that is not visible in the image. The road in front of the store appears to be a residential street with a speed limit sign indicating 25 mph. There are no other cars visible in the image, but there are a few pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. It appears to be daytime, as there are no streetlights visible.
