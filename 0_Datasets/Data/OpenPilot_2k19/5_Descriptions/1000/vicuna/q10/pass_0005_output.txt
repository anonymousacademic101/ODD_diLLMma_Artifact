This is a photograph of a city street at night, taken from the perspective of a car driving down the road. The street is lined with streetlights and trees, and there are buildings on either side of the road. The cars on the road have their headlights on, illuminating the road ahead. There are no pedestrians visible in the image. The time of day is night, as the sky is dark and there are no visible sunlight or shadows. The road appears to be a multi-lane highway, with multiple lanes for traffic in both directions. There are no visible road signs or intersections in the image.
