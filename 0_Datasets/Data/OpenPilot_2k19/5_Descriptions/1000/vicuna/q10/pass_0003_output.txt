This image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down a highway. The road is straight and has two lanes in each direction. There are trees on both sides of the road, and some buildings can be seen in the distance. The sky is cloudy and there is a bridge in the distance. Cars are driving in both directions on the highway. There are no pedestrians or bicycles visible in the image. The time of day appears to be morning or afternoon, as the sun is shining, but it is not bright enough to cause glare on the windshield.
