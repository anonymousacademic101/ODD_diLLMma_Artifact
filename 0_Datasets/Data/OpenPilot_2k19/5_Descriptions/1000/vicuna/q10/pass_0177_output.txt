This image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down a highway at night. The car is on the left side of the image, with the driver's side facing forward. The road is straight and has two lanes, with the left lane being the fast lane and the right lane being the slow lane. There are no other cars visible in the image, but there are streetlights on both sides of the road, illuminating the area. The time of day is night, as the sky is dark and there are no visible stars. The image is taken from the driver's perspective, looking out the front windshield of the car.
