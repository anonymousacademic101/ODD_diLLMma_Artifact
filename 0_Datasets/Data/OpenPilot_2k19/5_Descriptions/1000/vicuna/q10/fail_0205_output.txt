This image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down a city street. The street is lined with trees on both sides and there are several cars parked on the side of the road. The building on the right side of the street is a large, white warehouse with several windows and a large roll-up door. There is a small sign on the building that is difficult to read from this angle. The sky is a bright blue and there are a few clouds visible. It appears to be a sunny day. There are no pedestrians or other vehicles visible in the image. The time of day is likely midday or early evening.
