This image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down a city street. The car is parked in front of a convenience store with a sign that reads "7-Eleven" on the building. There are several other cars parked on the street and a few pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The time of day appears to be morning, as there are still some lights on in the store and the sun has not yet risen fully in the sky. The road is straight and there are no major road signs or intersections visible in this image.
