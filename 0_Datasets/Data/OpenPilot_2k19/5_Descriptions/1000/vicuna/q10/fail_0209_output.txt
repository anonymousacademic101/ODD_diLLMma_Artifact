This is a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down the street. The car is parked at a gas station with several other cars parked around it. There is a gas pump on the left side of the car and a sign for gas prices on the right side. The road is straight and there are no turns or intersections in sight. The time of day appears to be morning or afternoon, as there are no shadows on the ground. There are no pedestrians or other vehicles in sight.
