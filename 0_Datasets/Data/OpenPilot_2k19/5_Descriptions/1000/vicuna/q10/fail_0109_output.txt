The image shows a road at night. The road is made of asphalt and has two lanes, one for each direction of traffic. The road is illuminated by streetlights that are mounted on poles along the side of the road. There are no vehicles or pedestrians visible in the image. The time of day is night, as indicated by the darkness and the presence of streetlights. The image was likely taken from the perspective of a driver in a car, as there is a steering wheel and gearshift visible in the foreground.
