The image shows a pharmacy store at night. The store is located on a busy street with multiple lanes of traffic. The building has large windows that allow natural light to enter the store. The store's name is written in large letters on the front of the building. The parking lot in front of the store is mostly empty, with a few cars parked haphazardly. There are no pedestrians visible in the image. The time of day is night, as there are no lights on in the surrounding area, and the sky is dark. The image is taken from the perspective of a driver in a car, looking out the front windshield.
