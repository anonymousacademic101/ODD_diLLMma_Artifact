This is a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down a highway. The road is straight and there are trees on both sides of the road. There are other cars on the road, driving in the same direction as the car in the video. There are no pedestrians visible in the video. The time of day appears to be daytime, as there is sunlight shining through the trees on the left side of the road. The road signs are not visible in the video.
