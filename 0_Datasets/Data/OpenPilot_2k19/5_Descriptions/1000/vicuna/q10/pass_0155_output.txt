This is a photograph of a city street at night, taken from the perspective of a driver in a car. The street is lined with streetlights and trees, and there are buildings on either side of the road. Cars are driving on the road, some of them in the left lane and some in the right lane. There are no pedestrians visible in the image. The time of day is night, as the sky is dark and there are no visible sunlight or shadows. The road appears to be straight and well-maintained, with no visible potholes or debris on the surface. There are no road signs visible in the image.
