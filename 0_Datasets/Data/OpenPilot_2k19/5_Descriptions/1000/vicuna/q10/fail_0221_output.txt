This is a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down a city street. The road is straight and there are several cars parked on the side of the road. There are also several pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The time of day appears to be daytime, as there is sunlight shining on the buildings and cars. The road signs are not visible in this image.
