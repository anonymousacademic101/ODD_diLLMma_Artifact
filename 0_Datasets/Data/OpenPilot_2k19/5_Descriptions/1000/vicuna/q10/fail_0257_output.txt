The image shows a dark night scene with streetlights illuminating the road. There are two cars parked at the side of the road, one on the left and one on the right. The cars are parked parallel to the road, with their front ends facing the camera. The road appears to be empty, with no other vehicles or pedestrians in sight. The time of day is night, as indicated by the darkness and the presence of streetlights. The image was likely taken from the perspective of a driver in one of the parked cars, looking out onto the street.
