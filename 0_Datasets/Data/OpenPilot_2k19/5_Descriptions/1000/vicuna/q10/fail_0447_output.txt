This image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down a two-lane road. The road has a yellow line down the middle, and there are trees and shrubs on either side of the road. The sky is clear and blue, with fluffy white clouds. There are no other cars visible in the image, but there are a few pedestrians walking on the side of the road. The time of day appears to be morning or afternoon, as the sun is shining from the left side of the image.
