This image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down a road. The road is a two-lane street with a yellow line down the middle. On the left side of the road, there are buildings and trees, while on the right side, there is a large white wall with black lettering that reads "Enterprise Rent-A-Car." There are no other cars visible in the image, but there are a few pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. It appears to be a sunny day, as there are no clouds in the sky and the sun is shining down. The time of day is likely morning or afternoon, as the sun is high in the sky but not directly overhead.
