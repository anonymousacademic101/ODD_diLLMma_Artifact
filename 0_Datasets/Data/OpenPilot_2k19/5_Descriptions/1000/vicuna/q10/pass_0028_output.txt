This image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down a highway at night. The road is straight and has two lanes in each direction. The speed limit sign shows 60 mph. There are no other vehicles on the road, but there are some pedestrians walking on the sidewalk next to the road. The road is well lit by streetlights, and the headlights of the car illuminate the road ahead. The time of day is night.
