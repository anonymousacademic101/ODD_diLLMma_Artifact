The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down a city street. The car is parked on the side of the road next to a building with a sign that reads "Dunkin Donuts." There are several other cars parked on the street, and a few pedestrians can be seen walking on the sidewalk. The time of day appears to be morning, as there are still some lights on in the building and the sun has not yet risen over the horizon. The road is straight and there are no notable road signs or hazards in the image.
