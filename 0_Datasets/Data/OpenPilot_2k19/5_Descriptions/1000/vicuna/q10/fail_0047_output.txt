This image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down a city street. The car is parked on the side of the road next to a fire hydrant. The building in the background is a white, modern-looking building with large windows and a red awning over the entrance. There are several cars parked on the street, and a few pedestrians can be seen walking on the sidewalk. The time of day appears to be daytime, as there is plenty of natural light and the sun is shining. There are no road signs or traffic signals visible in the image.
