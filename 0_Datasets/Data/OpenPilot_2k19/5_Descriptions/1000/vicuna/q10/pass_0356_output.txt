This image shows a city street scene with tall buildings on both sides of the road. The road appears to be a two-way street with two lanes, one for each direction of traffic. There are several cars driving on the road, including a white van in the left lane and a black sedan in the right lane. There are also several pedestrians on the sidewalk, some of whom are walking in the same direction as the cars and some of whom are walking in the opposite direction.

There are several road signs visible in the image, including a stop sign at the intersection of the road and another street, a yield sign indicating that drivers should yield to pedestrians, and a speed limit sign indicating that the speed limit is 30 miles per hour.

The time of day appears to be late afternoon or early evening, as the sun is setting in the background and the shadows of the buildings are long.

Overall, this image shows a typical city street scene with a mix of cars, pedestrians, and road signs. Drivers should pay attention to the stop and yield signs, as well as the speed limit, to ensure safe and legal driving.
