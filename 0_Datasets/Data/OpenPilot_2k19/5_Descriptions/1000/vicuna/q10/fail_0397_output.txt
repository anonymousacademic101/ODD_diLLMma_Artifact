This image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down a city street. The street is lined with tall trees on both sides, and there are several cars parked on the side of the road. The road has two lanes, one for traffic heading in each direction. There is a traffic light at the intersection, with a green light for traffic heading in one direction, a red light for traffic heading in the other direction, and a yellow light for pedestrians crossing the street. There are several pedestrians walking on the sidewalk, and a few more crossing the street at the crosswalk. The time of day appears to be late afternoon or early evening, as the sun is setting in the distance.
