This image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down a city street. The street is lined with tall trees on both sides, and there are buildings visible in the distance. The road has two lanes, one for traffic going in each direction. There are traffic lights at the intersection, with a green light for traffic going straight, a red light for traffic turning left, and a yellow light for traffic turning right. There are also road signs indicating the speed limit, which is 45 mph. There are no pedestrians visible in the image. The time of day appears to be daytime, as there is bright sunlight shining through the clouds in the sky. The car's windshield is tinted, making it difficult to see the driver's face.
