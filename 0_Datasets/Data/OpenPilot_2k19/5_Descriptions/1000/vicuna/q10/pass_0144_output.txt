This image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down a city street at night. The street is lined with trees on both sides and there are buildings on either side of the road. The road is straight and there are no turns or intersections in sight. The traffic is light, with only a few cars and trucks visible in the distance. There are no pedestrians or bicycles on the road. The time of day is night, as the sky is dark and there are no lights from the sun or other sources. The image is taken from inside the car, looking out the front windshield.
