This is a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down a highway. The road is straight and there are trees on both sides of the road. There are other cars on the road, some driving in the same direction as the car in the video, and some driving in the opposite direction. There are no pedestrians visible in the video. The time of day appears to be daytime, as there is plenty of natural light coming through the trees. There are no road signs visible in the video.
