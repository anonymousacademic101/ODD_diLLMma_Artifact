The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car traveling down a two-lane road. The road is straight and there are trees on both sides of the road. The sky is clear and there are fluffy white clouds in the sky. There is a yellow center line down the middle of the road and a white line on the right side of the road. There are no other vehicles on the road. There are no pedestrians or bicycles on the road. The time of day appears to be morning or afternoon, as the sun is shining, but the shadows are not too long. The image was taken from a moving vehicle, which is why the trees in the background appear to be blurred.
