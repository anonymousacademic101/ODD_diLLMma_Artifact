This image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down a highway. The road is straight and there are trees on both sides of the road. There are several other cars on the road, some in front of the car and some behind it. There is a green sign on the right side of the road that says "Southbound". The time of day appears to be daytime, as there is sunlight shining through the trees. There are no pedestrians visible in the image.
