The road is a multi-lane highway with a concrete divider in the middle, and there are cars and trucks driving in both directions. There are also several pedestrians walking on the sidewalk, and a few cyclists on the road. The time of day appears to be morning or afternoon, as there are shadows visible on the ground, but the sun is not fully risen or set. There are several road signs visible, including stop signs, yield signs, and speed limit signs. The speed limit on this road appears to be 50 or 60 miles per hour. There are also several buildings visible on either side of the road, including commercial and residential structures.
