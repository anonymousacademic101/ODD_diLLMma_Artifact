This is a view from the driver's seat of a car driving on a highway. The road is straight and there are two lanes going in the same direction. The road surface is asphalt and there are no visible potholes or cracks. The speed limit sign shows 65 mph. There are no other vehicles visible in the image, but there are some pedestrians walking on the sidewalk next to the road. The time of day appears to be daytime, as there is bright sunlight shining on the road.
