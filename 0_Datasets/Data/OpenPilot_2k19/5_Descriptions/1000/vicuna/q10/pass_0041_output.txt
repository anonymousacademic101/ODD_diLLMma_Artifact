This image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car traveling down a city street. The road is straight and divided by a double yellow line. On the left side of the road, there are several trees and buildings, while on the right side, there are more buildings and some cars parked on the side of the road. The traffic is heavy with cars traveling in both directions. There are several road signs, including stop signs, yield signs, and speed limit signs. Some pedestrians can be seen crossing the street, and there are also some cyclists on the road. It appears to be daytime, as there are no lights on in the buildings or on the street.
