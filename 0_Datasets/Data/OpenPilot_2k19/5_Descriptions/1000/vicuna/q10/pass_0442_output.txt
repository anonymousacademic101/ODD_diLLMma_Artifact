This image shows a view from the driver's perspective of a city street. The street is lined with tall buildings on both sides and there are several cars driving on the road. The road has two lanes, one for traffic going in each direction. There is a traffic light at the intersection, with a green light for traffic going straight, a red light for traffic turning left, and a yellow light for traffic turning right. There are also several pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The time of day appears to be daytime, based on the bright blue sky and the shadows of the buildings.
