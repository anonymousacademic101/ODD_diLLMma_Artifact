This is a view from the driver's seat of a car traveling down a highway. The road is straight and there are trees on both sides. The time of day is sunset, as the sky is orange and the sun is setting behind the trees. There are no other vehicles on the road, but there are some pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The road signs are not visible from this angle.
