This is a photograph of a city street at dusk, taken from the perspective of a driver in a car. The street is lined with trees on both sides, and there are buildings visible in the distance. The road has two lanes in each direction, with a center line dividing them. There are no pedestrians or other vehicles visible in the image. The time of day is dusk, indicated by the dim lighting and the shadows cast by the trees.
