This image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down a city street. The street is lined with parked cars on both sides, and there are buildings on either side of the street as well. The road surface appears to be in good condition, with no visible potholes or other damage. There are no visible road signs or traffic signals in the image. The time of day appears to be daytime, as there is plenty of natural light and the shadows of the buildings suggest that the sun is shining. There are no pedestrians visible in the image.
