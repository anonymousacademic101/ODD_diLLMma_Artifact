This image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car traveling down a road. The road appears to be a city street, with buildings and trees lining both sides. The road has two lanes, one for traffic heading in each direction. There are road signs on both sides of the road, including stop signs, yield signs, and speed limit signs. There are also pedestrians on the sidewalk, some of whom are crossing the street. The time of day appears to be daytime, as there are no lights on in the buildings and the sun is shining. The weather appears to be clear, as there are no clouds in the sky.
