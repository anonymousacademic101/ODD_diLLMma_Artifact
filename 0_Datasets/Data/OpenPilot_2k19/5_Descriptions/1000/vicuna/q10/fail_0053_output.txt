The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down a city street. The car is parked at the curb in front of a white building with a sign that reads "KFC" in red letters. The building has large windows and a white facade with a red awning over the entrance. The street is lined with trees on either side and there are several other cars parked along the curb. It appears to be daytime, as there are people walking on the sidewalk and the sun is shining.
