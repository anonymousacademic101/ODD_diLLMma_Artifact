The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down a city street. The car is parked on the side of the road in front of a building with a sign that reads "Subway" above the entrance. The building appears to be a restaurant or fast food establishment. There are several parked cars on the street, and a few pedestrians can be seen walking on the sidewalk. The time of day appears to be morning, as there are still some lights on in the building and the sun has not yet risen fully over the horizon.
