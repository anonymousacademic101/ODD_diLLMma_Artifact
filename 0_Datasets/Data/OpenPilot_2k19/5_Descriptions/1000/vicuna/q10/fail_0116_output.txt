This image shows a dark, winding road at night. The road appears to be made of asphalt and is lined with trees on either side. There is a wooden fence on the left side of the road, and a metal guardrail on the right side. The road appears to be going downhill, and there is a sharp turn at the bottom of the hill. There are no other vehicles or pedestrians visible in the image. The time of day is night, and the lighting is provided by the headlights of the car.
