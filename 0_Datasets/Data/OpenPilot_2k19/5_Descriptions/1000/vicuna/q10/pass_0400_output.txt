This is a view from the driver's seat of a car traveling down a highway. The road is straight and has two lanes in each direction. There are trees on both sides of the road and some buildings can be seen in the distance. The sky is clear and the sun is shining. There are other cars on the road, some of which are driving in the same direction as the car in the video, while others are driving in the opposite direction. There are also pedestrians on the sidewalk, some of whom are walking in the same direction as the car, while others are walking in the opposite direction. The time of day appears to be morning, as the sun is just starting to rise in the sky.
