This image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car parked outside a building. The building has a white facade with large windows and a red awning over the entrance. The car is parked on the right side of the image, next to a parking meter with a sign indicating that parking is prohibited during certain hours. The road in front of the building appears to be a one-way street, with traffic traveling in the opposite direction of the car. There are no pedestrians visible in the image. The time of day appears to be daytime, based on the bright sunlight illuminating the scene.
