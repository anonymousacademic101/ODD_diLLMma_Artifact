This image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down a city street. The street is lined with trees on both sides and has a clear blue sky above. There are several cars driving in the same direction as the camera car, as well as a few pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The road has a speed limit sign indicating 35 mph, and there is a stop sign at the intersection ahead. It appears to be daytime, as there are no streetlights visible.
