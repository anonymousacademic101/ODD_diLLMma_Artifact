This image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car traveling down a two-lane road. The road has a yellow line down the middle, indicating that it is a divided road. There are trees on both sides of the road, and some of them appear to be leaning over the road. There are no other vehicles visible in the image, but there are a few pedestrians walking on the sidewalk on the left side of the road. The time of day appears to be morning or afternoon, as the sun is shining from the right side of the image, casting shadows on the left side of the road.
