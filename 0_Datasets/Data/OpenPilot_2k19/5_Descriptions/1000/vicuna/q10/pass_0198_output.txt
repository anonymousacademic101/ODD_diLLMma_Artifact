The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down a highway at dusk. The road is straight and has two lanes in each direction, with a concrete divider in the middle. There are no other cars visible in the image, but there are some pedestrians walking on the sidewalk next to the road. The sky is cloudy and dark, with the sun setting behind the clouds. There are streetlights on both sides of the road, illuminating the area. The speed limit sign shows 60 mph.
