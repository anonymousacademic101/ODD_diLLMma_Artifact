The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down a street. The street is lined with trees on both sides and has a sidewalk on the opposite side of the road. There are buildings on both sides of the street, some of which appear to be shops or restaurants. The sky is clear and the sun is setting, casting long shadows on the ground. There are no other cars visible in the image, but there are a few pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The time of day appears to be late afternoon or early evening.
