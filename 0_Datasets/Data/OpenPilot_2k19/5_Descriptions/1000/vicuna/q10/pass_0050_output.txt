This is a photograph of a city street at night. The street is lined with trees on both sides, and there are streetlights illuminating the area. There are several cars driving on the road, and there are also some pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The time of day is night, and the lighting is provided by the streetlights and the headlights of the cars.

The road is a multi-lane highway with two lanes in each direction. There is a center median dividing the lanes, and there are also turn lanes at the intersections. The road surface is asphalt, and there are no visible potholes or other damage.

There are several road signs on the side of the road, including speed limit signs, warning signs for upcoming intersections, and signs indicating the direction of the highway. There are also several traffic lights controlling the flow of traffic at intersections.

There are no visible pedestrian crossings, but there are sidewalks on both sides of the road for pedestrians to use. There are also several pedestrian crossings further down the road that are not visible in this image.

Overall, this is a photograph of a well-maintained city street at night, with good lighting and clear road markings.
