This image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down a city street. The car is parked in front of a store with a sign that reads "Shoppers Drug Mart." There are several other cars parked along the street, and a few pedestrians can be seen walking on the sidewalk. The time of day appears to be late afternoon, as the sun is setting in the background. The road is straight and there are no major road signs or intersections visible in the image.
