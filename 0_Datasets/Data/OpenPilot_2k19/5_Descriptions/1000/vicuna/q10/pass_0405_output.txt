The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down a city street. The street is lined with trees on both sides and there are buildings visible in the background. The road has two lanes in each direction and there is a green overhead sign indicating the direction of the road. There are no other vehicles visible in the image, but there are several pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The time of day appears to be morning or afternoon, as the sun is shining, but it is not bright enough to cause glare.
