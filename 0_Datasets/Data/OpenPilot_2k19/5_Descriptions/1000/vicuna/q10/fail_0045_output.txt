This image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car parked in front of a building. The building appears to be a commercial establishment, with large windows and a white facade. The car is parked on the right side of the image, next to a fire hydrant and a parking meter. The road in front of the building appears to be a one-way street, with traffic traveling in the opposite direction of the car. There are no pedestrians visible in the image. The time of day appears to be daytime, based on the bright sunlight illuminating the scene.
