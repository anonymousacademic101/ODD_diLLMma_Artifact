The image shows a CVS pharmacy store at night. The store is located in a strip mall and has large windows that allow for natural light to enter the store during the day. At night, the store is illuminated by bright lights that shine through the windows, making it easy to see the store from the outside.

The road in front of the store is a two-lane road with a speed limit of 35 miles per hour. There are no pedestrians or other vehicles visible in the image. The time of day appears to be night, as the sky is dark and there are no visible sunlight or shadows.

There are several road signs visible in the image, including a stop sign, a yield sign, and a speed limit sign. The stop sign indicates that drivers must come to a complete stop before proceeding through the intersection. The yield sign indicates that drivers must yield the right of way to pedestrians or other vehicles that are already in the intersection. The speed limit sign indicates that the speed limit on this road is 35 miles per hour.

There are no visible pedestrians or other vehicles in the image, so there is no need to pay attention to them while driving. However, drivers should always be aware of their surroundings and be prepared to react to any potential hazards, such as pedestrians or other vehicles that may suddenly appear.
