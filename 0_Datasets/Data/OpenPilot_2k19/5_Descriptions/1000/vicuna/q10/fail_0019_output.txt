The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down a city street. The street is lined with buildings on both sides, some of which are red brick and others appear to be made of concrete. There are several cars parked on the side of the road and a few cars driving in the same direction as the camera car. The road has a yellow line down the middle and there are no pedestrians visible in the image. The time of day appears to be daytime, as there are no lights on in the buildings and the sun is shining.
