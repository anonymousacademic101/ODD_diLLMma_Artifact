This is a video taken from the driver's perspective of a car driving down a highway. The road is straight and there are trees on both sides of the road. The sky is cloudy and it appears to be dusk or dawn. There are other cars on the road, some in front of the camera car and some behind it. There are also pedestrians on the sidewalk, some of whom are walking in the same direction as the camera car and some of whom are walking in the opposite direction. There are road signs indicating the speed limit and lane markings on the road. It appears to be a busy highway with a lot of traffic.
