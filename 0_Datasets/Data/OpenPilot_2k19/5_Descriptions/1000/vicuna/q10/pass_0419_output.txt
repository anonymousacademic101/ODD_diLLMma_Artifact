This image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down a highway at night. The road is straight and has two lanes in each direction, with a center divider in the middle. The speed limit sign on the right side of the road says 65 mph. There are no pedestrians or other vehicles visible in the image. The time of day is night, as the sky is dark and there are no visible streetlights. The car's headlights are illuminating the road ahead.
