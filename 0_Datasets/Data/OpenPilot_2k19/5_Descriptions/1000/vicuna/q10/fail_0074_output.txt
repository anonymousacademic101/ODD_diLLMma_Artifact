This image shows a gas station at night. The gas station is located on a busy street, with multiple lanes of traffic passing by. The gas pumps are on the left side of the image, while the entrance to the store is on the right side. The store has large windows that allow customers to see inside. There is a sign above the entrance that reads "Gas Station" in blue neon lights. The parking lot is mostly empty, with a few cars parked haphazardly. There are no pedestrians visible in the image. The time of day is night, as there are no lights on in the surrounding area, and the sky is dark. The image is taken from the perspective of someone driving by the gas station, looking through the windshield of their car.
