This image shows a Walgreens pharmacy at night. The store is located in a strip mall and has a large glass facade with the company's logo displayed prominently on the front. The parking lot is mostly empty, with only a few cars parked haphazardly. The road in front of the store is a two-lane road with a speed limit of 35 miles per hour. There are no pedestrians or other vehicles visible in the image. The time of day appears to be late evening, as the sky is dark and there are no lights on in the store or surrounding buildings. Overall, this is a typical image of a Walgreens pharmacy at night.
