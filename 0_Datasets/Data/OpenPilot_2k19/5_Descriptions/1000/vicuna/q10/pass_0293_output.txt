This is a view from the driver's seat of a car traveling down a city street. The street is lined with tall buildings on both sides and there are several cars driving in the same direction as the camera car. There are also several pedestrians on the sidewalk, some of whom are walking in the same direction as the camera car and some of whom are walking in the opposite direction. The time of day appears to be cloudy and overcast. There are no road signs visible in this image.
