This image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down a city street. The car is parked in front of a building with a sign that says "Starbucks" on it. There are several other cars parked along the street, and there are pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The time of day appears to be morning, as there are still some lights on in the building and the sun has not yet risen fully over the horizon. The road is straight and there are no major road signs or intersections visible in the image.
