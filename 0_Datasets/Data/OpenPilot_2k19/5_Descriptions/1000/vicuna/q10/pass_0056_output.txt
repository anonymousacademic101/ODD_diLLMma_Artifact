The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down a city street at night. The street is lined with streetlights and buildings on either side, with cars and trucks driving in both directions. The road has four lanes, two in each direction, with a median divider in the middle. There are no pedestrians visible in the image. The time of day is night, as the sky is dark, and the streetlights are on. The image was taken from a moving vehicle, as there is a slight blur effect in the image.
