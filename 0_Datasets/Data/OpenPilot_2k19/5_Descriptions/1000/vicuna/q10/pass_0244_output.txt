This is a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down a highway. The road is straight and there are trees on both sides of the road. There are no other vehicles on the road, but there are some pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The sky is clear and blue, and the sun is shining. It appears to be daytime. There are no road signs visible in this image.
