The image shows a gas station at night. The gas station is lit up by blue neon lights, which illuminate the building's exterior. The gas pumps are visible in the foreground, with the price per gallon displayed on a sign above them. The windows of the building are tinted, making it difficult to see inside. The road in front of the gas station is empty, with no cars or pedestrians visible. The time of day is night, as there are no lights on in the surrounding area, and the sky is dark.
