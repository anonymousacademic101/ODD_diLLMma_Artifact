This image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down a straight road surrounded by trees on both sides. The road appears to be a two-lane road with a center line dividing the lanes. There are no visible road signs or pedestrians in the image. The time of day appears to be daytime, as there is bright sunlight shining through the trees on the left side of the image. The car in the image appears to be driving in the right lane.
