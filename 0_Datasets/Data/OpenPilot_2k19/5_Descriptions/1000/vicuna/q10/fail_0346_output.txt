This image shows a gas station at night. The gas station has a blue and white sign that says "Gulf" on it. The gas pumps are on the left side of the image, and there are several cars parked at the pumps. The road in front of the gas station is empty, and there are no pedestrians or other vehicles visible. The time of day appears to be night, as the sky is dark and there are no visible streetlights. The image was likely taken from the driver's perspective, as there is a steering wheel and dashboard visible in the foreground.
