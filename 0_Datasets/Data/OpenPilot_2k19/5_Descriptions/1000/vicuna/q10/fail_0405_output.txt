This is a view of a parking lot with several cars parked in it. There is a gas station on the right side of the image and a road running in front of it. The road has two lanes, one for incoming traffic and one for outgoing traffic. There are no pedestrians visible in the image. The time of day appears to be daytime, as there is plenty of natural light and the sun is shining on the cars. The image was taken from the perspective of a driver in a car, looking out the front windshield.
