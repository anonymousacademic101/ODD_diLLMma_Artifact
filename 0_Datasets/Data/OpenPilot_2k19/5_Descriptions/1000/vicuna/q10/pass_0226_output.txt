This is a photograph of a city street at night, taken from the perspective of a driver in a car. The street is lined with streetlights and trees, and there are buildings on either side of the road. The road appears to be a highway or major road, as there are multiple lanes and a median divider. There is moderate traffic on the road, with cars driving in both directions. There are no pedestrians visible in the image. The time of day is night, as the sky is dark and there are no visible sunlight or shadows. The image was likely taken in the fall or winter, as there are no leaves on the trees.
