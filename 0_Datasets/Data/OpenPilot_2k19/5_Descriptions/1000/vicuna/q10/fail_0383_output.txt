This image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down a road. The road appears to be straight and there are trees on both sides of the road. There are also buildings visible in the distance, which appear to be a gas station and a convenience store. The sky is cloudy and overcast. There are no other cars visible in the image, but there are a few pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. It appears to be daytime, as there are no streetlights visible.
