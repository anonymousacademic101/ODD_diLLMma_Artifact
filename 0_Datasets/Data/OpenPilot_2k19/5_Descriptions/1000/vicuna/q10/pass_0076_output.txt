This is a view from the driver's seat of a car traveling down a highway. The road is straight and there are trees on both sides of the road. There are several other cars on the road, traveling in the same direction as the car in the video. There are no pedestrians visible in the video. The time of day appears to be daytime, as there is plenty of natural light coming through the trees. The road signs are not visible in the video.
