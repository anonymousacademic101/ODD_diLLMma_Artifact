This is a photograph of a city street at night, taken from the perspective of a car driving down the road. The street is lined with trees on both sides, and there are streetlights illuminating the area. There are several cars driving on the road, some of which have their headlights on, while others do not. There are also several pedestrians walking on the sidewalk, some of whom are carrying umbrellas to protect themselves from the rain. The time of day is night, and the sky is overcast, with no stars or moon visible. There are no road signs visible in the photograph.
