This is a photograph of a highway at night, taken from the perspective of a car driving down the road. The road is straight and divided, with two lanes going in opposite directions. The road is illuminated by streetlights, which are mounted on poles along the side of the road. There are no pedestrians or other vehicles visible in the image. The time of day is night, as indicated by the darkness of the sky and the lack of daylight. The image was taken from the driver's perspective, looking out the front windshield of the car.
