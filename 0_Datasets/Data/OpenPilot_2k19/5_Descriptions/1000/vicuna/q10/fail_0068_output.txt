The gas pumps are also lit up, making it easy to see where to insert the nozzle. The road in front of the gas station is empty, with no cars or pedestrians in sight. The time of day appears to be night, as the sky is dark and there are no lights on in the surrounding buildings. The weather appears to be clear, as there are no clouds visible in the sky. Overall, this is a well-lit and inviting gas station at night.
