This image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down a highway at night. The road is straight and there are no turns or intersections in sight. The car's headlights illuminate the road ahead, and the taillights illuminate the road behind. There are no other vehicles on the road, but there are some pedestrians walking on the sidewalk next to the road. The sky is dark, but there are some streetlights on the side of the road, casting a yellow glow on the surroundings. It appears to be a clear night with no rain or fog. The time of day is night.
