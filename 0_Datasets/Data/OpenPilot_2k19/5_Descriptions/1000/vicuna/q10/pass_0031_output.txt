This image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car traveling down a city street. The street is lined with trees on both sides and there are several cars driving in the same direction as the camera car. The time of day appears to be morning or early afternoon, as the sun is shining brightly and casting long shadows on the road. There are no visible road signs or pedestrians in the image. The road appears to be straight and wide, with a center divider and lane markings. The camera car is traveling at a moderate speed, and the other cars on the road appear to be moving at the same speed.
