The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down a city street at night. The street is lined with tall buildings on both sides and there are streetlights illuminating the road. The car's headlights are on, illuminating the road ahead. There are other cars on the road, some of which are driving in the same direction as the car in the image, while others are driving in the opposite direction. There are also pedestrians on the sidewalk, some of whom are walking in the same direction as the car, while others are walking in the opposite direction. The time of day is night, as the sky is dark and there are no visible stars. The image is taken from a low angle, looking up the road, so the buildings on either side of the road are tall and appear to stretch up to the sky.
