This image shows a view from inside a car driving down a city street at night. The street is lined with streetlights and trees, and there are buildings on either side of the road. The car is driving on the right side of the road, and there are other cars and trucks driving in both directions. There are also pedestrians on the sidewalk, some of whom are carrying umbrellas to protect themselves from the rain. The time of day is night, and the lighting is provided by the streetlights and the headlights of the cars.
