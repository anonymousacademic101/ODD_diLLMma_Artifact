This image shows a residential street with a row of houses on one side and a parked car on the other side of the road. The houses are made of bricks and have gray roofs. There are trees lining both sides of the street, providing shade during the day. The road has a yellow line down the middle, indicating that it is a one-way street. There is a stop sign at the end of the road, indicating that it is a dead-end street. There are no pedestrians or other vehicles visible in the image. The time of day appears to be late afternoon or early evening, as the sun is setting behind the houses on the left side of the street.
