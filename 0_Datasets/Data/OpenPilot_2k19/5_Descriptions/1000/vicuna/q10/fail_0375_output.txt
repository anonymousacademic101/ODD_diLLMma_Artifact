This image shows a view from the driver's perspective of a city street. The street is lined with tall buildings on both sides and there are cars, trucks, and buses driving on the road. The road has multiple lanes and there are road signs indicating the speed limit, lane markings, and upcoming intersections. There are also pedestrians on the sidewalk, some of whom are crossing the street. The time of day appears to be morning or afternoon, as there is sunlight in the sky, but it is not bright enough to create glare on the windshield. The weather appears to be cloudy.
