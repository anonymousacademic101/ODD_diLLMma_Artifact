The car is driving on the right side of the road, and there are other cars and trucks on the road as well. The traffic is moderate, with some cars driving in the left lane and others in the right lane. There are no pedestrians visible in the image. The time of day is night, as the sky is dark, and the headlights of the car and other vehicles are illuminating the road.
