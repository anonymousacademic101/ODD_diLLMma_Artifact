This image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down a city street. The street is lined with buildings on both sides, some of which have green awnings over their storefronts. There are several cars parked on the side of the road, and a few pedestrians can be seen walking on the sidewalk. The time of day appears to be daytime, as there are bright sunlight and shadows visible. The road structure appears to be a typical city street, with a center lane and two lanes for traffic in each direction. There are traffic signs visible, including a stop sign and a yield sign.
