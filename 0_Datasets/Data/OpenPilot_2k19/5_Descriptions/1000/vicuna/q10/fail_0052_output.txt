This image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down a city street. The car is parked in front of a building with a sign that says "Deli" on it. The building has large windows and a white facade. There are several parked cars on the street, and a few pedestrians can be seen walking on the sidewalk. The time of day appears to be morning, as there are still some lights on in the building and the sun has not yet risen fully. The road is straight and there are no major road signs visible in the image.
