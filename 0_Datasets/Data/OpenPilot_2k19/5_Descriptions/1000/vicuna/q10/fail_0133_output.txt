The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving under an overpass on a city street. The overpass appears to be made of concrete and has two lanes for traffic. The road under the overpass is asphalt and has two lanes as well, with a center line dividing them. There are no pedestrians visible in the image, but there could be some on the sidewalk on the other side of the road. The time of day appears to be dusk or dawn, as there is some light from the sky, but it is not bright enough to clearly see the surroundings. There are no road signs visible in the image, but there could be some on the overpass or on the other side of the road.
