This image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down a highway at night. The road is straight and has two lanes in each direction. There are no visible road signs or pedestrians in the image. The time of day is night, as the sky is dark and there are no visible stars. The car's headlights illuminate the road ahead, and the taillights illuminate the road behind. The car's windshield is tinted, making it difficult to see the driver's face. The speedometer in the car shows a speed of 60 mph.
