The image shows a parking lot with several cars parked in it. The parking lot is surrounded by a white fence and has a gate for entry and exit. The gate is made of metal bars and has a sign that reads "EXIT" in red letters. The road in front of the parking lot is a two-lane road with a yellow line in the middle. There are no pedestrians visible in the image. The time of day appears to be daytime, as there is sunlight shining on the cars and the road. The image was taken from the driver's perspective, looking out the front windshield of a car.
