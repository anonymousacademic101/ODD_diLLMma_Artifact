This is a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down a city street. The street is lined with cars parked on both sides and a few pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. There is a gas station on the left side of the road with a sign that reads "Gas" and a price of $3.50 per gallon. The road has two lanes, one for traffic heading north and one for traffic heading south. There is a traffic light at the intersection, currently showing a green light for northbound traffic and a red light for southbound traffic. The time of day is morning, as the sun is just starting to rise in the sky. The weather is clear and sunny.
