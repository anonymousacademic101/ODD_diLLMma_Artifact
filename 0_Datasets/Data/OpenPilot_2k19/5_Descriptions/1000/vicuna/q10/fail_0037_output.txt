This image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car parked on the side of the road in front of a building. The building appears to be made of white bricks and has a large window on the front. There is a parking meter on the sidewalk next to the car, and a "No Parking" sign is visible on the wall of the building. The time of day appears to be daytime, as there are no lights on in the building and the sun is shining. There are no pedestrians visible in the image.
