This image shows a view from the driver's perspective of a busy city street. The road is divided into multiple lanes, with cars traveling in both directions. There are several tall buildings on either side of the street, with several cars parked on the side of the road. There are also several streetlights and signs along the road, including stop signs, yield signs, and speed limit signs. The time of day appears to be daytime, as there are no lights on in the buildings and the sun is shining. There are also several pedestrians walking on the sidewalk.
