This image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down a busy street at night. The street is lined with streetlights and trees, and there are several buildings visible on either side of the road. There are also several cars and trucks on the road, as well as a number of pedestrians walking along the sidewalk. The time of day appears to be night, as the sky is dark and there are no visible sunlight or daylight sources. The image is taken from the perspective of someone driving a car, so the view is slightly obstructed by the windshield and the steering wheel.
