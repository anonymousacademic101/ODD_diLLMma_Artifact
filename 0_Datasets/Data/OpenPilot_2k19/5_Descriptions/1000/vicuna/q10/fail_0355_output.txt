This image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down a city street. The road is straight and there are trees on both sides of the road. There are buildings on either side of the street, some of which appear to be apartment complexes. The sky is cloudy and overcast. There are no other cars visible in the image, but there are a few pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The time of day appears to be late afternoon or early evening, based on the position of the sun in the sky.
