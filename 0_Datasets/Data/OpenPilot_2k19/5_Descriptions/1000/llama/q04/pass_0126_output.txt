The road we are driving on is an intersection. It runs horizontally across the image.

The image shows a dark and empty highway at night. There are no other cars on the road, and the only light comes from the headlights of the car in the foreground. The sky is dark and cloudy, with no stars visible. The trees on either side of the road are bare and leafless, and the only sound is the hum of the car's engine.

The image is taken from the perspective of the driver in the car, looking straight ahead down the road. The car's headlights illuminate the road ahead, casting long shadows on the pavement. The driver's face is illuminated by the dashboard lights, but the rest of the car is in darkness.
