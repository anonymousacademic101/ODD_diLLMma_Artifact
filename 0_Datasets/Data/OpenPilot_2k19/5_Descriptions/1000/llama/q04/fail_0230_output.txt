The image shows a parking lot with several cars parked in it. The building in the background appears to be a restaurant or store. The lighting in the parking lot is dim, and the cars are parked in a row. There are no other vehicles or pedestrians visible in the image.

The road in the image runs horizontally across the image, parallel to the parking lot. It appears to be a paved road with a few cars parked on it. The lighting in the road is also dim, and there are no other vehicles or pedestrians visible in the image.

Therefore, the answer to your question is NO, the road does not run horizontally across the image.</s>
