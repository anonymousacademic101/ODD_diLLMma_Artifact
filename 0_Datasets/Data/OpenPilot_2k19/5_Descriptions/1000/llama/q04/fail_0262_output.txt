The image shows a car driving down a road at night. There are streetlights on either side of the road, and the car's headlights illuminate the road ahead. The car is traveling at a moderate speed, and the driver appears to be paying attention to the road. There are no other vehicles or pedestrians visible in the image.

The road is not an intersection, but rather a continuous stretch of asphalt that runs horizontally across the image. The car is driving on the right side of the road, and there are no obstacles or hazards visible in the image.

Therefore, the answer to the question is NO, the road is not an intersection.</s>
