The image shows a dark tunnel with a car driving through it. The car's headlights are on, illuminating the inside of the tunnel. The tunnel appears to be made of concrete and has a smooth surface. There are no other cars or pedestrians visible in the image.

The answer to your question is NO, the road does not run horizontally across the image. The road is visible in the foreground of the image, running parallel to the tunnel. The tunnel appears to be the main focus of the image, with the car driving through it taking up most of the frame.</s>
