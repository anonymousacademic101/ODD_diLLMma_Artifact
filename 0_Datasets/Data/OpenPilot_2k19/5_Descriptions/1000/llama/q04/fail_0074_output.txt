The image shows a gas station with a car parked in front of it. The car's headlights are on, and the driver is visible through the windshield. The gas pumps are visible in the background, and there is a sign on the side of the building that reads "Gas Station." The image is taken at night, as evidenced by the streetlights and the car's headlights.

Is the road we are driving on an intersection, or does it run horizontally across the image?

NO, the road does not run horizontally across the image. The car is parked in front of the gas station, and the road is visible in the background, but it does not run horizontally across the image.</s>
