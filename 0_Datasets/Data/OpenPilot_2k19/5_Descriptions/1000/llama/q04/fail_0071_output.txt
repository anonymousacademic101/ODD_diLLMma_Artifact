The image shows a gas station at night with the neon lights on. The car is parked in front of the gas pumps, and the driver is sitting in the driver's seat, looking out the windshield. The sky is dark and cloudy, and there are no other cars or people visible in the image.

Is the road we are driving on an intersection, or does it run horizontally across the image?

No, the road does not run horizontally across the image. It appears to be a straight road that runs in front of the gas station.</s>
