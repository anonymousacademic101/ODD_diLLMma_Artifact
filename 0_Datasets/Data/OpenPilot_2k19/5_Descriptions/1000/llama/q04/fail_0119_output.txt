The image shows a dark road with a wooden fence on the left side and a light pole on the right side. There is a car parked on the right side of the road with its headlights on. The image is taken at night, and the only light source is from the headlights of the car.

The road is not an intersection, but rather a continuous road that runs horizontally across the image. The car is parked on the right side of the road, and the light pole is on the left side. The image is taken at night, and the only light source is from the headlights of the car.

The car is parked on the right side of the road, and the light pole is on the left side. The image is taken at night, and the only light source is from the headlights of the car.</s>
