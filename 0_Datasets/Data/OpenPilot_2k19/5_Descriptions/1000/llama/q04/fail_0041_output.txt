The image shows a car parked in front of a building with a sign that reads "Cafe". The car is parked on the side of the road, and there are no other vehicles or pedestrians in sight. The sky is cloudy and there is no sunlight visible in the image.

The road we are driving on is an intersection, as it meets with another road at a 90 degree angle. The intersection has a stop sign on one side and a yield sign on the other. There are no other vehicles or pedestrians in sight.

Therefore, the answer to your question is YES, the road we are driving on is an intersection.</s>
