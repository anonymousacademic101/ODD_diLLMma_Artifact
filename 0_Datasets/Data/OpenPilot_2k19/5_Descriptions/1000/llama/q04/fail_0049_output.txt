Yes, the road we are driving on is an intersection. The image shows a car parked in front of a building with a sign that reads, "Welcome to our restaurant." The car is parked in a parking lot, and there are other cars parked in the lot as well. The building appears to be a restaurant or cafe, and there are tables and chairs set up outside for customers to sit and eat. The image is taken from the perspective of someone driving down the street, looking at the building and the cars parked in the lot.</s>
