The image shows a gas station at night with a car parked in front of it. The car's headlights are on, illuminating the road and the gas pumps. The sky is dark and cloudy, with a few stars visible in the distance. There are no other cars or people visible in the image.

The road is horizontal across the image, running from the left side of the image to the right. The gas pumps are located on the right side of the image, with the car parked in front of them. The building on the left side of the image appears to be a convenience store or restaurant.

Therefore, the answer to the question is NO, the road does not run horizontally across the image.</s>
