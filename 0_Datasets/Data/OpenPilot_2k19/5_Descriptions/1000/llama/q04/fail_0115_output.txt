The image shows a dark tunnel with a car driving through it. The car's headlights are on, illuminating the tunnel. The tunnel appears to be made of concrete and has a smooth surface. There are no other cars or obstacles visible in the tunnel. The image is taken at night, as evidenced by the streetlights on either side of the tunnel.

The road we are driving on is not an intersection, as there are no other roads or intersections visible in the image. It appears to be a straight road that runs horizontally across the image.</s>
