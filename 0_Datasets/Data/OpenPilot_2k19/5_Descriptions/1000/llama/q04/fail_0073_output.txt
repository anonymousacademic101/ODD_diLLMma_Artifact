The image shows a gas station at night with a car parked in front of it. The car's headlights are on, illuminating the gas pumps and the road in front of the station. The sky is dark and there are no other cars or people visible in the image.

The road in the image runs horizontally across the image, from the left side of the image to the right side. It appears to be a straight road with no curves or intersections.

Therefore, the answer to your question is NO, the road does not run horizontally across the image.</s>
