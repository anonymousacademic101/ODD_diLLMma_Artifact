The image shows a car parked in front of a building with a sign that reads "Hotel". The car is parked on the side of the road, and there are no other vehicles or pedestrians in the image. The sky is cloudy and there are no other buildings or structures visible in the image. Therefore, the road we are driving on is not an intersection, but rather a straight road that runs horizontally across the image.</s>
