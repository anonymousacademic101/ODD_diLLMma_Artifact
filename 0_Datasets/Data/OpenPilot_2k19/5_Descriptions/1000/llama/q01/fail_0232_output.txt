The image shows a car parked in front of a store at night. The car's headlights are on, illuminating the parking lot. There are no other cars or pedestrians visible in the image. The store's sign is visible in the background, but it is not clear what kind of store it is. The image is not obstructed, covered, or damaged by mud, ice, snow, excessive paint or adhesive products. Therefore, the answer is NO.</s>
