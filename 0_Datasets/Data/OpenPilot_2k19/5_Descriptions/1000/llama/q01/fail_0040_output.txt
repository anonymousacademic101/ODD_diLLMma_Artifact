Yes, the camera that took this image was obstructed by mud. The image shows a car parked in front of a building with a large puddle of mud in the parking lot. The car's windshield is covered in mud, and the driver's side mirror is also covered in mud. The image was taken at night, and the lighting is poor, making it difficult to see the details of the car and the building.</s>
