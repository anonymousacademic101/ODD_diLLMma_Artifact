The image shows a parking lot with cars parked along the side of the road. The building in the background appears to be a large retail store with a sign that reads, "CVS Pharmacy." There are no pedestrians or other vehicles visible in the image.

The question asks if the road we are driving on is a sharp curve. Based on the image, it does not appear that the road is a sharp curve. The cars parked along the side of the road suggest that the road is straight and flat.

Therefore, the answer to the question is NO.</s>
