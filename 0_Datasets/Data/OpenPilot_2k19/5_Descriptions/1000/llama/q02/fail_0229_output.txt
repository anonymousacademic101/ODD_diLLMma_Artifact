The image shows a street at night with streetlights on both sides of the road. There are cars parked on both sides of the road, and the driver's side window is open. The driver is looking out at the road ahead.

The answer to your question is NO. The road is not a sharp curve. It appears to be a straight road with streetlights on both sides.</s>
