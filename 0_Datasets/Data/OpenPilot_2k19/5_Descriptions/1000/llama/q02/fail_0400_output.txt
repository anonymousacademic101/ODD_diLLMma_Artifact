The image shows a road with a sharp curve in the middle. The road is surrounded by trees and buildings on either side. There are no other cars or pedestrians visible in the image.

The answer to your question is NO. The road is not a sharp curve. It appears to be a straight road with a slight bend in the middle. There are no other cars or pedestrians visible in the image, so it is likely that the road is empty.</s>
