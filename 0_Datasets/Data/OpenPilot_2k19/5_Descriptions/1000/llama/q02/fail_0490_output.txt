The image shows a driveway leading up to a house with a garage on the left side. The driveway is lined with trees on both sides, and there is a car parked in front of the house. The sky is cloudy and there is no sunlight visible.

The answer to your question is NO, the road we are driving on is not a sharp curve. The driveway is straight and leads up to the house.</s>
