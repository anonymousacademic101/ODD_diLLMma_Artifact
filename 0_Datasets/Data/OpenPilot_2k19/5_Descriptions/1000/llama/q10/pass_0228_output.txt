This image shows a highway at night with cars driving in both directions. The road is well-lit and there are no pedestrians or other obstacles in the way. The time of day is not visible, but it appears to be nighttime based on the darkness of the sky. The car in the foreground is driving in the same direction as the other cars on the road.</s>
