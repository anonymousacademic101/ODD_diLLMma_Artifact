This image shows a highway at night with cars driving in both directions. There are streetlights on both sides of the road and a few pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The time of day appears to be around 10 pm based on the shadows on the road and the darkness of the sky. The road is well-maintained and has two lanes in each direction with a median in the middle. There are no major obstacles or hazards visible in the image, but it is important to be cautious when driving at night due to reduced visibility and potential hazards such as pedestrians or debris on the road.</s>
