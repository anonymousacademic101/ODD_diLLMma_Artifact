There are two cars driving on the highway, one in the left lane and the other in the right lane. There are also pedestrians walking on the sidewalk next to the highway. The sky is dark and cloudy, and there are streetlights on both sides of the highway. The time of day appears to be late afternoon or early evening, based on the position of the sun in the sky.</s>
