This is an image of a street at night. There are several cars parked along the side of the road, and a few pedestrians can be seen walking in the distance. The streetlights are on, illuminating the road and the surrounding buildings. The sky is dark and cloudy, with some stars visible in the distance. The time of day is unknown, but it appears to be late at night based on the shadows cast by the streetlights and the darkness of the sky.</s>
