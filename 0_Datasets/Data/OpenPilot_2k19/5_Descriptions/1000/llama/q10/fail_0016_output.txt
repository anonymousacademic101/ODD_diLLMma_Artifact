The image shows a street with a yellow sign on the left side of the road. The sign has the words "Yellow Arrow" written on it in black letters. The street is lined with trees on both sides, and there are cars parked along the side of the road. The sky is cloudy and there are no pedestrians or other vehicles visible in the image. The time of day is difficult to determine, but it appears to be early in the morning or late in the evening based on the shadows cast by the trees.</s>
