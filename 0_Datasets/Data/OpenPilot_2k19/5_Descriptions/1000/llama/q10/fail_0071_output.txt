The pumps are made of metal and have hoses attached to them. There are two cars parked in front of the building, one on either side of the entrance. The cars are white and have their headlights on. There are streetlights on either side of the road in front of the building. The sky is dark and there are stars visible in the sky. There are no pedestrians or other vehicles visible in the image.
