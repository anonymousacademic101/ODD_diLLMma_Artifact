This is an image of a highway at night with cars driving on it. The road is divided into two lanes, one in each direction, with a median in the middle. There are streetlights on both sides of the road, illuminating the road and the cars driving on it. The sky is dark and cloudy, with a few stars visible in the distance. There are no pedestrians or other vehicles visible in the image. The time of day is unknown, but it appears to be nighttime based on the darkness of the sky.</s>
