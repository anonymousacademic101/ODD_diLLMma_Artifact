The image shows a street with a stop sign at the intersection. There are two cars parked on the side of the road, one on the left and one on the right. The buildings on either side of the street are made of brick and have multiple floors. There are no pedestrians or other vehicles visible in the image. The sky is clear and there are no clouds. The time of day is difficult to determine from the image, but it appears to be daytime based on the shadows on the buildings.</s>
