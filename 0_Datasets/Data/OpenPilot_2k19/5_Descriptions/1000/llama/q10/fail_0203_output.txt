The image shows a street with several cars parked on the side of the road. The building on the left side of the street appears to be a large, modern office building with many windows and a flat roof. The building on the right side of the street appears to be a smaller, older building with a sloping roof and a few windows. There are no pedestrians or other vehicles visible in the image. The sky is clear and blue, with a few white clouds scattered across it. The time of day is difficult to determine from the image, but it appears to be during the day based on the shadows cast by the buildings and the sun's position in the sky.</s>
