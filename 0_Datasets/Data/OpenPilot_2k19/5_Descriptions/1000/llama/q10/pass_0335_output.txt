This is an image of a highway at night. The road is empty and there are no other cars or pedestrians visible. The sky is dark and cloudy, with a few stars visible in the distance. There are streetlights on both sides of the road, casting a dim glow on the asphalt. The time of day is unknown, but it appears to be late at night based on the darkness of the sky and the lack of other cars or pedestrians on the road.</s>
