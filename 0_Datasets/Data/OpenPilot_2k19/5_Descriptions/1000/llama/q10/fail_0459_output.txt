The image shows a man standing on the side of a road, looking down at something on the ground. The road is a two lane highway with a yellow line in the middle. There are trees on both sides of the road and a blue sky in the background. The man is wearing a blue shirt and jeans and has a backpack on his back. There are no other vehicles or pedestrians visible in the image. The time of day appears to be early morning or late afternoon based on the shadows on the road and the man's clothing.</s>
