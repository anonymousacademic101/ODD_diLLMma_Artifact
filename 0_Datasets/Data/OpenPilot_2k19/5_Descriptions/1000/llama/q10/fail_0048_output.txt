The image shows a car parked on the side of a street in front of a building. The car has its hazard lights on and the driver's side window is rolled down. There are no pedestrians or other vehicles visible in the image. The sky is cloudy and there is no sunlight visible. The time of day is difficult to determine from the image, but it appears to be daytime based on the shadows on the building.
