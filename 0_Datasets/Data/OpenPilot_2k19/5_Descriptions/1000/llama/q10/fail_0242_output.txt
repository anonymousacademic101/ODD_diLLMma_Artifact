This is an image of a street at night. There are several cars driving down the road, and some pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The streetlights are on, illuminating the road and surrounding area. The sky is dark and cloudy, with some stars visible in the distance. The time of day appears to be around 9 or 10 pm, based on the position of the sun and the shadows cast by the streetlights.</s>
