The image shows a dark and empty road at night. There are no cars or pedestrians in sight, and the only light comes from the headlights of the car in the foreground. The road is made of asphalt and is lined with trees on both sides. There is a sign on the left side of the road that reads `No Trespassing`. The time of day appears to be around midnight, judging by the position of the stars in the sky.</s>
