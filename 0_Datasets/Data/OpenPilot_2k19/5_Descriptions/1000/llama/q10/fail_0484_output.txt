This is an image of a residential street with a car parked in front of a house. The car is a white sedan with tinted windows and a sunroof. The house is a two story with a red roof and white siding. There are two trees in the front yard, one on the left and one on the right. The street is paved with asphalt and there are no pedestrians or other vehicles visible in the image. The time of day is difficult to determine from the image, but it appears to be daytime based on the shadows on the cars and houses. There are no road signs or traffic signals visible in the image.</s>
