This is an image of a road at night. The road is empty and there are no cars or pedestrians in sight. The sky is dark and there are some stars visible in the sky. There are streetlights on both sides of the road, casting a dim glow on the asphalt. The road is straight and there are no curves or intersections in sight. The time of day is unknown, but it appears to be late at night based on the darkness of the sky.</s>
