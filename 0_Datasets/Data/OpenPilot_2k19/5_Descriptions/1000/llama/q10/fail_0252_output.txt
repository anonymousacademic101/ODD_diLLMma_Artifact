This is an image of a Walgreens pharmacy at night. The building is made of brick and has a large sign on the front that reads "Walgreens." There are several cars parked in front of the building, and a few pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk. The time of day appears to be around 9 or 10 pm, as there are streetlights illuminating the area. The sky is dark and cloudy, with a few stars visible in the distance.</s>
