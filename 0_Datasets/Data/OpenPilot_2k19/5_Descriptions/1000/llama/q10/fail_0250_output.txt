This is an image of a Walgreens pharmacy at night. The building is made of brick and has a large sign on the front that reads, "Walgreens." There are several cars parked in front of the store, and a few pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk. The time of day appears to be around 9 or 10 pm, as the streetlights are on and the sky is dark. There are no other cars or pedestrians visible in the image.</s>
