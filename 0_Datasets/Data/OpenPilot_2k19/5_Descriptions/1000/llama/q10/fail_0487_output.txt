The image shows a driveway leading up to a house with a garage on the left side. The driveway is made of asphalt and is lined with trees on both sides. There are no cars parked in the driveway, but there is a car parked in the garage. The house is a two story with a gabled roof and a chimney on the left side. The windows are all closed and there are no curtains or blinds on them. There are no people or animals visible in the image. The time of day appears to be during the day, as the sun is shining and there are no shadows on the ground. The weather appears to be clear, as there are no clouds in the sky. The image is taken from the driver's seat of a car, looking down the driveway towards the house.</s>
