The image shows a car parked on the side of a street in front of a building. The car is a white sedan with tinted windows and a sunroof. The building is a two story brick structure with a sign on the front that reads, "John's Cafe". There are no pedestrians or other vehicles visible in the image. The time of day is difficult to determine, but it appears to be during the day based on the shadows on the building. There are no road signs or traffic cones visible in the image.</s>
