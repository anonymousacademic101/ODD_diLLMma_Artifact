The image shows a street at night with cars parked on the side of the road. The streetlights are on, and there are people walking on the sidewalk. The image is taken from the perspective of the driver's seat of a car.

The answer to the question is NO. The road is not narrow and winding. It appears to be a straight road with cars parked on the side.</s>
