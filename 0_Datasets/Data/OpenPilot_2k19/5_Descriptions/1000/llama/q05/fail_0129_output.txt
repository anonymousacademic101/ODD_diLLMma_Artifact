The image shows a dark tunnel with a car driving through it at night. The car's headlights illuminate the road ahead, but the rest of the tunnel is dark. There are no other vehicles or pedestrians visible in the image.

The answer to your question is NO, there are no restricted lanes for buses or bicycles in the tunnel. The tunnel is designed for cars to drive through, and there are no designated lanes for other types of vehicles.</s>
