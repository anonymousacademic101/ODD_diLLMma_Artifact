The image shows a car parked in front of a building with a sign that reads "Restricted Lane". The car appears to be parked in a designated parking space, but the sign indicates that the lane is restricted for certain types of vehicles, such as buses or bicycles. The image does not show any other vehicles parked in the area, and there are no pedestrians or other obstacles in the way of the car. Therefore, the answer is NO, there are no restricted lanes in this area.</s>
