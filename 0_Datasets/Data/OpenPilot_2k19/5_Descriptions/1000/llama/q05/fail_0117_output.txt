The image shows a car driving down a dark road at night. There is a sign in the distance that reads "Road Closed" in white letters on a black background. The car's headlights are on, illuminating the road ahead.

The answer to your question is NO. The road does not have any restricted lanes, such as for buses or bicycles.</s>
