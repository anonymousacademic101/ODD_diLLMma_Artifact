The image shows a car driving down a dark road at night. There are no other cars or pedestrians visible in the image. The road is lined with trees and bushes, and there are streetlights on either side of the road. The car's headlights are on, illuminating the road ahead.

The image does not show any restricted lanes for buses or bicycles. The road appears to be a public road with two lanes in each direction. There are no signs or markings indicating that the road is restricted for any type of vehicle.

Therefore, the answer to the question is NO, there are no restricted lanes for buses or bicycles on the road in the image.</s>
