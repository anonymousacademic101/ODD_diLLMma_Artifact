The image shows a dark and empty highway at night. There are no cars or other vehicles visible on the road, and the only light comes from the headlights of the car driving down the road. The sky is dark and cloudy, with a few stars visible in the distance. The road is straight and flat, with no obstacles or hazards in sight.

The answer to the question is NO, there are no restricted lanes on the road for buses or bicycles. The road is designed for cars and other vehicles, and there are no designated lanes for other types of transportation.</s>
