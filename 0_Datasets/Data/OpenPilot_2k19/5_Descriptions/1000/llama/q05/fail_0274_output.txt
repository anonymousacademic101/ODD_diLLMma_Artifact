The image shows a car driving down a street at night with other cars parked along the side of the road. There are no pedestrians or other vehicles visible in the image.

The road appears to be well-lit, with streetlights on either side of the road. The buildings on either side of the road are also well-lit, with windows and doors visible.

There are no signs of any restricted lanes, such as bus lanes or bicycle lanes, visible in the image.

Therefore, the answer to the question is NO, there are no restricted lanes visible in the image.</s>
