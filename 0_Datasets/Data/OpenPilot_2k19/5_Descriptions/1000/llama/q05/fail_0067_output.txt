The image shows a car driving down a dark road at night. The car's headlights are on, illuminating the road ahead. There are no other cars or pedestrians visible in the image.

The question asks if the road has any restricted lanes, such as for buses or bicycles. Since there are no other cars or pedestrians visible in the image, it is unlikely that there are any restricted lanes on the road. Therefore, the answer is NO.</s>
