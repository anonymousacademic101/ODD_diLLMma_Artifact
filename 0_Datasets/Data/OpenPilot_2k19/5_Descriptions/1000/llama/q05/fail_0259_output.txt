The image shows a car driving down a road at night. There are streetlights on either side of the road, and the car's headlights illuminate the road ahead. There are no other cars or pedestrians visible in the image.

The question asks if there are any restricted lanes on the road, such as for buses or bicycles. Based on the image, there do not appear to be any restricted lanes on the road. Therefore, the answer is NO.</s>
