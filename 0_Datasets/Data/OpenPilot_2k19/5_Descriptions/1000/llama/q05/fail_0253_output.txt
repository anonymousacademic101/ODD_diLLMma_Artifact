The image shows a car driving down a street at night. There are streetlights on both sides of the road, and the car's headlights illuminate the road ahead. There are no other cars or pedestrians visible in the image.

The image does not show any restricted lanes, such as for buses or bicycles. The road appears to be a regular street with two lanes of traffic, one for cars and the other for pedestrians.

Therefore, the answer to the question is NO, there are no restricted lanes visible in the image.</s>
