The image shows a car driving down a dark and empty highway at night. The headlights of the car illuminate the road ahead, but there is no other traffic on the road. The sky is dark and cloudy, with a few stars visible in the distance. The car's windshield wipers are on, but there is no rain on the windshield.

The answer to the question is no, the road is not hilly. The road is flat and straight, with no hills or curves in sight. The car is driving at a steady speed, with the driver's hands on the steering wheel and their eyes on the road ahead. There is no other traffic on the road, and the only sound is the hum of the car's engine and the wind rustling through the trees on either side of the road.</s>
