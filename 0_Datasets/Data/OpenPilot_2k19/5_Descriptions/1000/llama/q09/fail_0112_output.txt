The image is of a dark road at night with no lights on. The car is driving down the road with its headlights on, illuminating the road ahead.

The answer to your question is no, the road is not hilly. The road is flat and straight, with no hills or curves in sight. The car's headlights are the only source of light on the road, making it difficult to see any obstacles or hazards ahead.</s>
