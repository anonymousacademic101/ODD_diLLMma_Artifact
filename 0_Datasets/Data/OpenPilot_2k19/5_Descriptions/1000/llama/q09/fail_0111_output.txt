The image is of a road at night with headlights shining on it. There are two cars parked on the side of the road, one with its headlights on and the other with its headlights off. The sky is dark and there are stars visible in the sky.

The question is asking if the road we are driving on is hilly. Based on the image, it appears that the road is not hilly, as there are no hills visible in the image. Therefore, the answer is NO.</s>
