The image shows a street with several cars parked on the side of the road. There are buildings on either side of the street, with windows and doors on the upper floors. The sky is cloudy and there are no trees or other vegetation visible in the image.

The answer to your question is NO, the road is not hilly. It appears to be a flat, urban street with buildings on either side.</s>
