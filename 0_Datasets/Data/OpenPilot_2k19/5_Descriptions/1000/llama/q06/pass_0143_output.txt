The image shows a car driving down a dark road at night. There are streetlights on either side of the road, but they are not very bright. The car's headlights are on, illuminating the road ahead. There are no other cars or pedestrians visible in the image.

The answer to your question is NO, there is no construction on the road we are driving on.</s>
