The image shows a gas station with a sign that says "Open 24 Hours" in the window. There are cars parked in front of the gas station and a person is standing in the driver's seat of one of the cars. The sky is dark and there are streetlights on either side of the road.

NO, there is no construction on the road we are driving on.</s>
