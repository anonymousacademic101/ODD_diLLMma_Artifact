The road we are driving on does not have any construction.

The image is of a dark and empty highway at night. There are no cars or other vehicles on the road, and the only light comes from the headlights of the car. The sky is dark and cloudy, and there are no stars visible. The road is straight and flat, and there are no obstacles or hazards in sight.</s>
