The image shows a gas station at night with a car parked in front of it. The car's headlights are on and the driver is looking out the window. There are no other cars or people visible in the image.

The question asks if the road we are driving on has any construction. Based on the image, there does not appear to be any construction on the road. The gas station and the car parked in front of it are the only things visible in the image. Therefore, the answer is NO.</s>
