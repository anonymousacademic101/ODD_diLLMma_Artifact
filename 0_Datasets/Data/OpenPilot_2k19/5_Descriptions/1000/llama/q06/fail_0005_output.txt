The image shows a car driving down a road with a building in the background. The building appears to be a fast food restaurant, with a sign on the front that reads "McDonald's". The car is parked in front of the building, and there are people walking in and out of the restaurant. The road appears to be empty, with no other cars or pedestrians in sight.

The answer to your question is NO, there is no construction on the road we are driving on.</s>
