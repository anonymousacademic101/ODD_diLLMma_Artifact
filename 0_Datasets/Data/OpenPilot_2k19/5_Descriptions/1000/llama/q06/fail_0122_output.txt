The image shows a car driving down a dark road at night. The headlights of the car are on, illuminating the road ahead. There is a sign in the distance, but it is not visible because of the darkness.

The answer to your question is NO, there is no construction on the road we are driving on. The road is empty and there are no other cars or obstacles in sight.</s>
