The image shows a dark and empty road at night. There are no cars or other vehicles on the road, and the only light comes from the headlights of the car in the foreground. The road appears to be straight and flat, with no obstacles or hazards in sight.

The question asks if the road we are driving on has any construction. Based on the image, there appears to be no construction on the road, as there are no signs or barriers indicating any work is being done. Therefore, the answer is NO.</s>
