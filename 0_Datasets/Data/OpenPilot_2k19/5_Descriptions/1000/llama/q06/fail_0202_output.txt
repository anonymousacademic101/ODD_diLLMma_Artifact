Yes, there is construction on the road we are driving on. The building on the left side of the road appears to be undergoing renovation, with scaffolding and tarps covering the windows and walls. The building on the right side of the road is also undergoing renovation, with scaffolding and tarps covering the windows and walls. There are several cars parked on the side of the road, but they are not obstructing the view of the construction.</s>
