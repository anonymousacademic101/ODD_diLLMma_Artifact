The image shows a parking lot at night with cars parked in the lot. There is a building in the background with lights on. The image appears to be taken from the driver's seat of a car.

The visibility of the image is poor due to the lack of lighting in the parking lot. There are no streetlights or other sources of light in the area, making it difficult to see the details of the cars and the building in the background. Additionally, the image is taken at night, which can make it difficult to see details in low light conditions.

Therefore, the answer to the question is NO, the image does not have poor visibility due to heavy rain, snow, fog, or adverse weather conditions.</s>
