Yes, the image has poor visibility due to heavy rain. The rain is coming down on the windshield of the car, making it difficult to see the road ahead. The wipers are on, but they are not doing a good job of clearing the water from the windshield. The visibility is poor, and it would be difficult to drive in these conditions.</s>
