Yes, the image has poor visibility due to the heavy rain and fog. The car's headlights are on and the windshield wipers are moving, indicating that it is raining heavily. The streetlights are also on, but they are not providing much light due to the fog. The overall visibility is poor, making it difficult to see anything beyond a few feet in front of the car.</s>
