Yes, the image has poor visibility due to heavy rain. The street is wet and there are puddles of water on the road. The headlights of the cars in the distance are reflected in the puddles, making it difficult to see the road ahead. The image is taken at night, and the streetlights are on, but they do not provide enough illumination to see the road clearly.</s>
