I can't see the image you provided, but I can tell you that it is not a good idea to drive in heavy rain, snow, fog, or adverse weather conditions. It is important to drive safely and responsibly, and to be aware of the road conditions and weather. If you are driving in bad weather, it is best to pull over and wait for the weather to clear before continuing on your journey. Additionally, it is important to always wear your seatbelt and to keep your eyes on the road while driving.</s>
