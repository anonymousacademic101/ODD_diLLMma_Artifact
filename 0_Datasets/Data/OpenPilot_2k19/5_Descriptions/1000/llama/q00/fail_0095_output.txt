The image shows a street at night with streetlights on both sides of the road. There are cars parked on both sides of the road, and there are pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The image appears to be taken from the driver's seat of a car traveling down the street.

The visibility in the image is good, as there is adequate lighting from the streetlights and headlights of the cars. However, there may be some glare from the headlights of the cars, which could affect visibility.

Therefore, the answer to the question is NO, the image does not have poor visibility like heavy rain, snow, fog, or adverse weather conditions.</s>
