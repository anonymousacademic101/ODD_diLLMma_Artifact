The image shows a gas station with a blue neon sign that reads "Gas" in white letters. There are two cars parked in front of the gas station, one with its headlights on and the other with its headlights off. The sky is dark and there are no other lights visible in the image.

The answer to your question is NO, there are no extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight into the camera. The only light source in the image is the blue neon sign on the gas station.</s>
