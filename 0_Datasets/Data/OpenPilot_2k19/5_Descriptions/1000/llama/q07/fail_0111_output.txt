The image is of a street at night with a car parked on the side of the road. The headlights of the car are on and shining brightly, illuminating the road and the surrounding area. There are no other lights in the image, just the headlights of the car.

The answer to your question is NO, there are no extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight into the camera. The only light source in the image is the headlights of the car.</s>
