The image shows a dark road with a fence on either side. There are no streetlights or other sources of light visible in the image, and the only light comes from the headlights of a car driving by in the distance. Therefore, the answer is NO, there are no extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight into the camera.</s>
