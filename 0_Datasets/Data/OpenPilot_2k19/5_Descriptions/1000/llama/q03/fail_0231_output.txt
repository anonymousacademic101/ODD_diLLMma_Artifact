The image shows a parking lot with several cars parked in it. There is a building in the background that appears to be a restaurant or store. There are no people visible in the image.

Is the road we are driving on an on-off ramp?

NO, the road is not an on-off ramp. It appears to be a paved road that leads to the parking lot.</s>
