The image shows a car driving on a road that appears to be an on-off ramp. The car is traveling in the direction of the on-off ramp, which is indicated by the sign on the side of the road. Therefore, the answer to the question is YES.

The reason why the road is an on-off ramp is because the sign on the side of the road indicates that it is an on-off ramp. The sign has an arrow pointing in the direction of the on-off ramp, indicating that it is an on-off ramp. Additionally, the road is designed to allow vehicles to enter or exit the road, which is consistent with the definition of an on-off ramp.</s>
