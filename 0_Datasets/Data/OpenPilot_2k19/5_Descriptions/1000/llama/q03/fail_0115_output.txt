The image shows a dark tunnel with a car driving through it. The car's headlights are on, illuminating the road ahead. The tunnel is lit by streetlights on either side, casting a dim glow on the walls and ceiling. The car's windshield wipers are on, clearing the windshield of rain or debris. The driver's face is illuminated by the headlights, but the rest of the car is in shadow. The image is taken from inside the car, looking out through the windshield.</s>
