The image shows a highway scene during what appears to be dawn or dusk, judging by the soft lighting and shadows. There are no extremely bright lights from oncoming vehicles or direct sunlight glaring into the camera that would cause significant visual obstruction or glare in the image. The lighting seems even and does not have overly bright spots that would suggest harsh light from headlights or the sun.
