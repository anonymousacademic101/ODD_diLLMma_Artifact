The image shows a scene taken during daylight hours without any significant glare or excessively bright lights from oncoming traffic or the sun directly hitting the camera lens. The lighting conditions appear to be normal for what seems to be clear weather, and there are no visible sources of extreme brightness such as the headlight beams of oncoming vehicles at night or direct sunlight that would impair visibility or overwhelm the camera sensor.
