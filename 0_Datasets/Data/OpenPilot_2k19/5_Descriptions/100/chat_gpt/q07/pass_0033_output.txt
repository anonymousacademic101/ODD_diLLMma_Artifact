NO.

While there are some lights visible from vehicles in the distance, none of them are overpowering or extremely bright. The image itself is rather dark, indicating it was likely taken during nighttime. The headlights and taillights of the other vehicles appear normal in brightness; there is no evidence of direct sunlight as it is night, and no oncoming headlights are glaring or so bright that they would blind the camera. The lighting conditions seem to be standard for night driving.
