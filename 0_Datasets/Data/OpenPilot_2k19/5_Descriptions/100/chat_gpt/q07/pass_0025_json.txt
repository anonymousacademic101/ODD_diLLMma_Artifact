Shadows cast by the trees on the side of the road indicate that the sun is overhead or slightly behind the camera, which means direct sunlight is not entering the lens in a way that would cause glare. The vehicles ahead do not have their headlights on, or if they do, they are not bright enough to be considered "extremely bright."'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
