The image shows a typical day scene with no evidence of extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight into the camera. The lighting appears normal for daytime conditions, and while there are some apparent artifacts on the windshield that may slightly reduce visibility, they are not indicative of direct, extreme light sources shining into the camera.
