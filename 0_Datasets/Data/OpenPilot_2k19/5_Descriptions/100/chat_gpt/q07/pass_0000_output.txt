NO

There are no extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight into the camera. The image appears to be taken during night time or in low light conditions, and while there are multiple sources of light visible, such as street lamps and vehicle headlights, none are overpowering or causing significant glare that would be described as "extremely bright." The lights present appear to be at normal brightness levels for nighttime driving conditions.
