NO

The image does not show extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight into the camera. The lighting appears normal for a bright day without any harsh glare or reflections that would indicate extreme brightness from headlights or the sun. The sky is clear and the sun's position is not directly facing the camera. The vehicles in the opposite lane do not have their headlights on, or if they do, they are not bright enough to be considered "extremely bright."
