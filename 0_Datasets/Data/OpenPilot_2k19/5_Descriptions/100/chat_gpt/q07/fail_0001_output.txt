NO

The image shows a somewhat hazy scene due to the setting sun, but there are no extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights, nor is there direct sunlight that is overpowering the camera's exposure. The ambient light is even, and while there is glare from the sun low on the horizon, it's not intense enough to be characterized as an extremely bright light that would significantly impair visibility or camera function.
