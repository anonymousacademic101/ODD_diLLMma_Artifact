There are no extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight visible. The headlights illuminating the road appear to belong to the vehicle from which the picture is taken, and they do not cause a glare or overly bright reflection in the camera. The absence of other light sources in the field of view supports the observation that no direct sunlight or oncoming headlights are causing extreme brightness in the image.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
