NO.

The image shows a street scene, likely taken from inside a vehicle, and there are no extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight glaring into the camera. The lighting in the image appears to be soft and diffused, possibly due to overcast weather, which is evident from the lack of hard shadows and the grey sky. There are two red traffic signals visible, but they are not extremely bright and do not cause any glare. The scene appears to be correctly exposed without any overpowering light sources affecting the image quality.
