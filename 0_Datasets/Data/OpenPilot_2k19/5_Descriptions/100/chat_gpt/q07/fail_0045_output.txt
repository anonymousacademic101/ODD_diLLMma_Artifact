NO

The image does not show extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight into the camera. The lighting in the image is relatively balanced without any intense light sources directly facing the camera that would cause significant glare or overexposure. The sky is overcast or it's possibly late in the day, which means the sunlight is not as intense as it would be around noon. There are no vehicles in the image facing the camera with their headlights on to cause bright light either.
