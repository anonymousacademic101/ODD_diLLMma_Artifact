NO.

The image shows a relatively dim scene without any apparent harsh lights from oncoming vehicles or direct sunlight causing glare or overexposure in the camera's view. The overall lighting appears overcast or it could be during dawn/dusk, resulting in subdued natural light. There are no signs of bright headlight beams facing toward the camera, nor is there a strong source of direct light in the image that would suggest extremely bright conditions.
