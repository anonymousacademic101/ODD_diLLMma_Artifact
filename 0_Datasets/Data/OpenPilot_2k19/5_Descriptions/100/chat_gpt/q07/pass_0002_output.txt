NO

There are no extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight in the camera's view. The image depicts a nighttime scene on a road with some distant lights from other vehicles, but none of them are bright enough to be considered as "extremely bright lights" into the camera. There is visible glare from what appears to be the vehicle's own headlights on the road surface, but it is not excessive or overwhelming to the view.
