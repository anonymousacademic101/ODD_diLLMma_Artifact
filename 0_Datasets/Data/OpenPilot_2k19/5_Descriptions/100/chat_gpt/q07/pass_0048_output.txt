The image provided is a nighttime scene, and there is a vehicle facing the camera with its headlights on. Although the lights do not appear to be excessively bright or blinding, they are still direct lights from oncoming traffic. The angle and context indicate that these lights might appear brighter to a driver due to the contrast with the surrounding darkness, but in the context of the photo, they do not overpower the scene or cause significant glare. There is no direct sunlight in the image as it is clearly nighttime.
