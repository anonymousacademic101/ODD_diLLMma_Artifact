One of the lights, appearing to be from an oncoming vehicle's headlight, is particularly bright and creates a glare effect on the camera. This bright light stands out against the darker surroundings, suggesting that it is quite intense compared to the ambient lighting. Additionally, the contrast and glare from this light can cause difficulty in seeing other parts of the scene clearly, indicating its intensity."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
