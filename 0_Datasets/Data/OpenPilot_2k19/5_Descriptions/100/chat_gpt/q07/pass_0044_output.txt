YES

Although there are no signs of extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights, there appears to be a considerable amount of direct sunlight coming into the camera. This sunlight is causing some lens flare and reduced contrast, indicative of bright lighting conditions. However, calling it 'extremely bright' might be subjective; the sun does not seem to be directly facing the camera, but the effect of brightness is there due to the angle of the sun and the clear sky.
