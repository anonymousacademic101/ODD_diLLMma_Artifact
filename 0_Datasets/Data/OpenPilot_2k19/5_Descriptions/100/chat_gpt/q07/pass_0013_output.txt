NO.

The image appears to be taken at night, and while there is some ambient lighting and vehicle headlights in the distance, nothing in the image is at an intensity that's extremely bright or causing glare that would be considered direct sunlight or the harsh light from oncoming headlights shining directly into the camera. The scene is relatively dark, and the existing lights are dim and not overpowering in the context of the image.
