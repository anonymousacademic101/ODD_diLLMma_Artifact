While there's no direct sunlight visible, indicating it's nighttime, the bright lights from oncoming vehicle headlights and possibly stationary lights are reflecting on the camera lens, causing blooms and streaks that suggest high intensity. The glare reduces the visibility and clarity of the photo, which is common when bright artificial lights shine directly into a camera's lens at night."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
