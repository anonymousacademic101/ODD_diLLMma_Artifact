NO

The photo shows an overcast or late-day sky, and there are no signs of extremely bright lights from oncoming vehicles or direct sunlight glaring into the camera. The lighting in the image is fairly diffuse and even, indicative of a cloudy sky or the time around dusk or dawn, which is not emitting harsh light. None of the vehicles in view seem to have their headlights on or are not at an angle that would cause a glare into the camera.
