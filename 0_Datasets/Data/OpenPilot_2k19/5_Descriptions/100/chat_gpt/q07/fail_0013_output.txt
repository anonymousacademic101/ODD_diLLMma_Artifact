The image shows a night scene illuminated by the vehicle's headlights. There are no extremely bright lights from oncoming vehicles nor direct sunlight visible in the image. The environment is dark, and the only source of light seems to be from the vehicle taking the picture, casting a glow on the ground and the fence to the left. The absence of glare from other lights indicates no direct interference from other bright light sources.
