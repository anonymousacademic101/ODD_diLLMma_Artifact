NO

There are no extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights, or direct sunlight into the camera. The headlights seen in the image are of a normal brightness level for vehicles at night and they do not overpower the camera sensor to the extent that would be considered "extremely bright." There is no direct sunlight because the setting appears to be nighttime.
