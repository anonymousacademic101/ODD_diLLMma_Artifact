The overall lighting in the image appears to be even and subdued, suggesting it's either overcast or the sun is not directly shining into the camera. There is no evidence of lens flare or overexposure that would indicate strong headlights or sunlight. The lights visible in the scene, such as the street lamp in the upper right, are standard and not producing a glare that would imply extreme brightness."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
