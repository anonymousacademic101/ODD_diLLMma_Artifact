There are no visible signs of extremely bright lights from oncoming traffic; the headlights of oncoming cars are not visible or are not bright enough to be considered "extremely bright." Additionally, there is no direct sunlight coming into the camera, which would typically be indicated by lens flare or overexposed areas of the image.
