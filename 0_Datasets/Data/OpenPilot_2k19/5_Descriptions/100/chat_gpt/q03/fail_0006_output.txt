YES

The road appears to be an on-off ramp as evidenced by the layout and design seen in the image. There is a vehicle entering the ramp from a perpendicular direction on the right, which suggests the merging function characteristic of an on-off ramp. Additionally, the presence of the traffic light and the dashed line between lanes further supports the identification of this road as an on-off ramp. The ramp may facilitate vehicles entering and exiting a freeway or a controlled-access highway.
