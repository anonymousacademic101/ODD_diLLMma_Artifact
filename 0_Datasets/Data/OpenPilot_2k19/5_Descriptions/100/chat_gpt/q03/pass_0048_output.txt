Based on the visible traffic lights, crosswalk markings, and the presence of intersecting roads with vehicles waiting, it appears you are at a standard intersection, not an on-off ramp. On-off ramps are typically associated with highways and do not have pedestrian crosswalks or intersections with traffic lights as shown in the image.
