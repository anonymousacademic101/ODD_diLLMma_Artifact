Instead, it looks like a regular city street intersection, controlled by traffic lights, and leading into a more residential or commercial area rather than a highway. The presence of crosswalks, traffic signals, and the layout of the road suggest that it's not designed for merging on or off high-speed traffic lanes but for regular urban traffic control."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
