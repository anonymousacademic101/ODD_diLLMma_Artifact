Instead, the setting appears to resemble a regular city street or access road. There are buildings directly adjacent to the road, a tree lining, and no visible signage or road markings that typically indicate an on/off-ramp. The presence of a parked car on the right also suggests that this is not an on-ramp or off-ramp, as such ramps usually do not have perpendicular parking spaces directly alongside them.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
