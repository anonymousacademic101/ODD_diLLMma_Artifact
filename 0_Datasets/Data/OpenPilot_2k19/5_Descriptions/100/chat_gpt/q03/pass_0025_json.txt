The road has a solid white line to the right that is typical for acceleration or deceleration lanes associated with on-off ramps. There are also vehicles that seem to be slowing down as they approach the exit, and the overall context suggests a transition between a highway and a local road. The presence of highway infrastructure, such as signs and possibly a merge lane, would commonly be indicative of an on-off ramp.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
