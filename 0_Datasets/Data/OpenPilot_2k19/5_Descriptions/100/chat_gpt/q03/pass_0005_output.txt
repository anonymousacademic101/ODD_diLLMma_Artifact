This does not appear to be an on-off ramp. The image shows a vehicle driving on what seems to be a highway or a multi-lane road with multiple lanes of traffic going in the same direction. On-off ramps typically have a single lane and are used for entering or exiting highways, featuring either a merge or an exit lane rather than a continuous multi-lane roadway.
