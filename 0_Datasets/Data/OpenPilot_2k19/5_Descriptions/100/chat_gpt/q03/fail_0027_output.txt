The road in the image does not appear to be an on-off ramp. Instead, it looks like a standard intersection with traffic lights and marked pedestrian crosswalks, which are features typically found on urban streets rather than highway on-off ramps. On-off ramps generally facilitate the movement of vehicles on and off highways and do not have traffic signals or crosswalks at the point of merging with or exiting from the highway.
