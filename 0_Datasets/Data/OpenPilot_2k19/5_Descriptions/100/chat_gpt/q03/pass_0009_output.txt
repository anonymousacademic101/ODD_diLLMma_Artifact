NO

Based on the image provided, there is no clear indication that we are on an on-ramp or off-ramp of a freeway or highway. Instead, the setting appears to resemble a regular city street or access road. There are buildings directly adjacent to the road, a tree lining, and no visible signage or road markings that typically indicate an on/off-ramp. The presence of a parked car on the right also suggests that this is not an on-ramp or off-ramp, as such ramps usually do not have perpendicular parking spaces directly alongside them.
