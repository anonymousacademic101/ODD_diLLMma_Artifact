NO.

The scene depicted in the image does not appear to be an on-off ramp typically associated with highways or freeways. Instead, it looks like a local road or a parking area exit based on the parking spaces seen in the background, the vehicles parked perpendicular to the road, and the residential buildings nearby. On-off ramps usually have signage and markings specific to merging with or exiting from high-speed traffic, which are not visible in this image.
