NO.

The road in the image does not appear to be an on-off ramp. The lanes here seem to be a part of a larger highway or freeway, as indicated by multiple lanes of traffic, the lack of exit signs, and the general flow of the traffic which doesn't suggest it is an area dedicated to entering or exiting a freeway. On-off ramps typically have a more pronounced curvature, tapering, or dedicated signage, which is not visible in this image.
