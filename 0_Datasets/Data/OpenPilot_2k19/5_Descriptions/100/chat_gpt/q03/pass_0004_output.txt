This does not appear to be an on-off ramp. The road has multiple lanes and is straight, as opposed to the more curved and merging/diverging characteristics of typical on-off ramps. Additionally, the roadway has a dashed line on the left side indicative of a lane for through traffic, rather than the solid lines typically found at the edges of on-off ramps. The road signs visible in the distance also suggest highway travel, not an exit or entrance ramp.
