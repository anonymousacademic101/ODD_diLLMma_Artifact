NO.

The road shown in the image appears to be a highway with multiple lanes and a dashed line indicating a lane division, typical of a through roadway rather than an on-off ramp. On-off ramps generally have single lanes or are marked by solid lines that diverge or converge with the main roadway. The traffic in the distance suggests a mainline highway with cars traveling at steady speeds, rather than the deceleration or acceleration patterns usually seen on on-off ramps.
