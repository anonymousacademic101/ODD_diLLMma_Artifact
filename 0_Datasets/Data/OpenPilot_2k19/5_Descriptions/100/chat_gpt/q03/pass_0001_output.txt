NO.

The road in the image appears to be a mainline interstate or highway rather than an on-off ramp. On-off ramps typically have more curved trajectories and are used for entering and exiting the main highway, but the road shown has multiple lanes and traffic is flowing in a straight direction, indicative of a main thoroughfare and not a ramp. Also, the presence of overhead direction signs for cities indicates that this is likely a stretch of road between exits.
