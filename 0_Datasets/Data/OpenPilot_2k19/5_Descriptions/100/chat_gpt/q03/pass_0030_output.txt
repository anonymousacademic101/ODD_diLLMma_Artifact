The image shows a multi-lane road with overhead direction signs indicating exits for different places. This suggests that the vehicle is on a freeway or a highway, not specifically on an on-off ramp. On-off ramps typically narrow down to one lane and do not have overhead gantry signs with directions for multiple exits. Additionally, the volume of traffic on multiple lanes indicates this is likely a main travel route, not an access ramp.
