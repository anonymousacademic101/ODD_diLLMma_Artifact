The road we are driving on appears to be a main highway or freeway lane rather than an on-ramp or off-ramp. On-ramps and off-ramps are typically single lanes that serve as points of ingress and egress to the highway, while the road in the image has multiple lanes and is running under an overpass with signs indicating directions for through traffic, consistent with a main travel route. The visible road lines and traffic patterns also suggest it is a main roadway rather than an access ramp.
