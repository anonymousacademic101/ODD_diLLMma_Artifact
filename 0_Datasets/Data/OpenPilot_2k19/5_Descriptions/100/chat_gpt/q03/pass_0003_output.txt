NO.

Without additional context or signage, it is not possible to definitively classify the road as an on-off ramp. The image shows a road with multiple lanes and traffic, which could be consistent with a highway, freeway, or a major road. On-off ramps typically have a single lane and are designed to connect roadways to allow vehicles to enter or exit highways or freeways. The visible road does not show characteristics that are exclusive to on-off ramps, such as significant curving or merging lanes that would indicate an entrance or exit to a major roadway.
