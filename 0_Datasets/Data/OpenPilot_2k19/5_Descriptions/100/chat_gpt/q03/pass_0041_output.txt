This does not appear to be an on-off ramp. The environment looks like an intersection with multiple lanes and traffic lights, which is more typical of city streets or suburban thoroughfares rather than the access or exit points of highways where on-off ramps are usually found. On-off ramps typically have different traffic control features, such as yield or merge signs, and they usually lead directly to or from a highway, often without traffic lights directly at the entrance or exit points.
