NO

The image given is not clear enough to definitively conclude that the road is an on-off ramp. The lighting conditions are poor, and there are no visible signs or road markings that typically characterize on-off ramps, such as arrows or dashed lines. Additionally, the road appears to be quite narrow and includes a wooden guardrail, which is not typical for an on-off ramp designed for highway speeds.
