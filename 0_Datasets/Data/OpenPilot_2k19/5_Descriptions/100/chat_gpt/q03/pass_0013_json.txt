On-off ramps typically have a more distinct curving pattern or merge signs and lane markings, which do not seem to be present in this image. Additionally, the presence of the dashed lines between lanes indicates it's a part of the main roadway where vehicles travel at higher consistent speeds, which is more characteristic of a highway than an on-off ramp."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
