The view appears to be of a regular intersection with traffic lights, not a highway on-off ramp. The presence of crosswalks and traffic signals, as well as the lane configurations, suggest this is an urban or suburban street intersection rather than a dedicated on-off ramp where signals are typically not found and traffic flow would be entering or exiting a highway. Additionally, the lane markings do not indicate the kind of merging or diverging typically associated with on-off ramps.
