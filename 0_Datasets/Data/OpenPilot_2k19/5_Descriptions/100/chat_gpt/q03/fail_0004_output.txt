NO.

The road we are driving on does not appear to be an on-off ramp. It looks like a typical city street with multiple lanes and a traffic signal at an intersection. On-off ramps are usually associated with highways or freeways and are designed to facilitate the merging of vehicles onto or off of the main roadway, often without traffic lights. This image shows an urban environment with buildings, a bus, cars, traffic lights, and a pedestrian crossing, which are more indicative of a standard city street than a highway on-off ramp.
