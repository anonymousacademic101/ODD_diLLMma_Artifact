From the image provided, it appears that the road we are driving on is likely an on-off ramp for a few reasons. The road has a solid white line to the right that is typical for acceleration or deceleration lanes associated with on-off ramps. There are also vehicles that seem to be slowing down as they approach the exit, and the overall context suggests a transition between a highway and a local road. The presence of highway infrastructure, such as signs and possibly a merge lane, would commonly be indicative of an on-off ramp.
