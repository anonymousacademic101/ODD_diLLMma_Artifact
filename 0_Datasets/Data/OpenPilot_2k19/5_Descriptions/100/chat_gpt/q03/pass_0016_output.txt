YES

The reasons to consider this a highway on-off ramp include the following observations:

1. The solid white line on the left demarcating the separation between the main lanes of the highway and the ramp.
2. The noticeable divergence of the lane from the main flow of traffic.
3. The presence of other vehicles that are also using the lane to either enter or exit the highway, which is typical behavior on an on-off ramp.
4. The typical width and layout of the lane suggest it is designed for the purpose of vehicles decelerating to exit or accelerating to merge with highway traffic.
