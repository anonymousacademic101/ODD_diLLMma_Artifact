The image shows a multi-lane highway with vehicles traveling in the same direction, indicative of a main travel lane rather than an on-off ramp. On-off ramps typically have a single lane and are used for entering or exiting highways, connecting the main travel lanes to local roads. The presence of multiple lanes and the flow of traffic suggests this is a part of the highway proper, not an on-off ramp.
