NO.

The image shows a multi-lane road with traffic traveling in the same direction, indicated by the red tail lights. On-off ramps typically narrow down to one lane and either merge onto or exit from a highway. The road in the image does not display characteristics of narrowing or curving that are common with on-off ramps. The lines on the road suggest a main travel lane on a highway rather than an on-off ramp.
