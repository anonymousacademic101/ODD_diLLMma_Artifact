Based on the image, it appears that we are not on an on-off ramp but rather in a parking lot or a driveway of a commercial establishment. Visible indicators include parking spaces, a sign for a pedestrian crosswalk, and the presence of a store in the background, all of which suggest a local driving environment rather than a highway or freeway ramp.
