Based on the image provided, we can see roadway markings that typically indicate an on-off ramp situation. There are dashed lines indicating a turning lane, as well as arrows on the pavement pointing to the right, suggesting a lane designated for vehicles to exit or enter a main road or highway. Additionally, there is a traffic light and a signpost, which are commonly found at junctions where ramps merge with surface streets.
