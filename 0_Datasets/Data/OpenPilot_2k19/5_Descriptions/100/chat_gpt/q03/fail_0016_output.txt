The road in the image does not appear to be an on-off ramp, typically associated with highways or freeways. Instead, it looks like a local road or an intersection due to the presence of multiple lanes with cars facing different directions, a residential area in the background, and a traffic situation that suggests a standard road rather than the more streamlined traffic flow you would expect on an on-off ramp.
