The presence of overhead signage with destinations and distances typical of highway markers, as well as the clear dividing lines between lanes, suggests that this is a main thoroughfare rather than an on-off ramp. On-off ramps typically have fewer lanes, are designed for slower speeds to facilitate the transition between highways and local roads, and usually have signage indicating an exit or entrance to a highway rather than destination distances. The road in the image does not display characteristics consistent with an on-off ramp.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
