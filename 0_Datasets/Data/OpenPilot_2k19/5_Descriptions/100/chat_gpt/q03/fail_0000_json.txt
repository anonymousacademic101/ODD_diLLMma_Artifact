The sign also seems to illustrate the ramp bending to the right, implying that the road we are driving on is merging with another road, characteristic of on-off ramps. Without additional context, it's difficult to determine with absolute certainty whether it's an on-ramp or off-ramp, but the sign provides a strong indication that it is one of the two."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
