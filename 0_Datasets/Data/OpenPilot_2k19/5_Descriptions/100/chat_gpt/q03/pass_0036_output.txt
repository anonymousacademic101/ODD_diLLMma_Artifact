NO.

The image provided shows a vehicle driving on what appears to be a multi-lane highway. An on-off ramp is a short section of road connecting the highway to local roads. The scene in the image does not have the characteristics of an on-off ramp but instead shows through lanes of a highway along with other vehicles that are traveling at typical highway speeds. The presence of multiple lanes and overhead road signs further indicates that this is a section of highway rather than an on-off ramp.
