NO.

The road shown in the image appears to be a multi-lane highway or freeway, not an on-off ramp. An on-off ramp typically serves as a transition between highways and local roads, comprising only one or two lanes and featuring sharper curves or inclines than those on a highway. The image displays multiple lanes of traffic moving in the same direction with vehicles traveling at highway speeds, indicating that this is a section of a main highway. Additionally, we can see overhead signs for exits which are common on highways, indicating that exits are approaching and not that we are currently on an on-off ramp.
