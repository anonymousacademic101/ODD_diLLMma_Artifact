NO.

Based on the visible lanes, traffic flow, and signage, this appears to be a main highway or freeway, not an on-off ramp. On-off ramps typically have a single lane or begin to narrow and rarely have traffic signs meant for longer distances. Additionally, the road seems to have multiple lanes consistent with a highway and there's no indication of entering or exiting traffic that you would typically see on an on-off ramp.
