NO.

The road in the image appears to be a multi-lane freeway, and the vehicle from which the photo is taken is in one of the main travel lanes, not entering or exiting the freeway. The presence of multiple lanes of traffic moving parallel to each other, without clear signage or lane markings indicative of an on-ramp or off-ramp, suggests that this is not an on-off ramp.
