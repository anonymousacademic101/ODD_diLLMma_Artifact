On-off ramps typically have more curved trajectories and are used for entering and exiting the main highway, but the road shown has multiple lanes and traffic is flowing in a straight direction, indicative of a main thoroughfare and not a ramp. Also, the presence of overhead direction signs for cities indicates that this is likely a stretch of road between exits.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
