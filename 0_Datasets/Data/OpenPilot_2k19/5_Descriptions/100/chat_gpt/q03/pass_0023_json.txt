Lane Markings: The dashed white lines on the right-hand side suggest a lane that is exiting or merging, as it is common for on-off ramps to have such markings.\n\n2. Roadside Signage: There is a yellow sign on the right with an arrow indicating a curve, which often signals an approaching exit or entrance ramp.\n\n3. Deceleration Lane: The widening of the road to the right suggests a deceleration lane, which is typical for vehicles about to exit a highway.\n\nThese elements collectively imply that the road in question is indeed an on-off ramp.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
