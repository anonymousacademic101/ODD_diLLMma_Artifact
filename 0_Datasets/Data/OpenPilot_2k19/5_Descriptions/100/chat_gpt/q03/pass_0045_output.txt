The road in the image appears to be a multi-lane highway, not a ramp. On-off ramps usually have a single lane and are typically used to enter or exit a highway. The road in the image has several lanes of traffic and doesn't show the characteristics of convergence or divergence that you would expect from an on-off ramp. The presence of multiple vehicles traveling at consistent speeds also suggests this is a main thoroughfare rather than an access ramp.
