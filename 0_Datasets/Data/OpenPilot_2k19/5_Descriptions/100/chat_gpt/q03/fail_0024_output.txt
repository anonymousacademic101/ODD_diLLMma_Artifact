The image appears to be taken from a vehicle on a surface street at night with other vehicles and infrastructure like retail stores and parking lots, which would typically not be present immediately adjacent to an on-off ramp. On-off ramps usually connect major highways or freeways to local roads and don't have direct access to parking areas as seen in the image.
