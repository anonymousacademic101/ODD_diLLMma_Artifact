The image shows a multi-lane road with a dividing barrier to the left and an exit sign visible in the distance. The presence of multiple lanes and an exit sign typically indicates a highway or freeway rather than an on-off ramp. Generally, on-off ramps are characterized by being narrower (often a single lane), having more pronounced curvature, and functioning as transitional connectors between roads of distinct types, such as a surface street and a highway, rather than being a part of the main roadway itself.
