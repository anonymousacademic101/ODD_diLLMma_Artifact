NO.

In the image provided, we can see vehicles stopped at a traffic signal, which suggests that this is an ordinary intersection rather than an on-off ramp. On-off ramps typically connect highways to local roads and are designed for vehicles to enter or exit highways without traffic lights. The presence of a traffic signal and cross traffic indicates that this is a regular road intersection.
