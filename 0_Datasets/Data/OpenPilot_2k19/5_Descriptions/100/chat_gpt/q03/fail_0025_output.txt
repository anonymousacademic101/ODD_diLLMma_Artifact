The image shows a vehicle at what appears to be a parking lot or a drive-through area near commercial buildings. There are no indications of highway signage, on-off ramp characteristics, or acceleration/deceleration lanes that typically accompany a highway ramp. The vehicles are close to buildings and parked cars, suggesting it is a local road or parking area rather than a highway ramp.
