YES.

The road appears to be an on-off ramp because there is a clear indication of an overpass or a highway bridge above, and the presence of signage on the right suggests directions for merging onto or exiting a highway. The vehicle in the lane next to the viewer is positioned to turn, which is typical for entering or exiting a ramp, and traffic lights are controlling the flow of traffic from the ramp onto a larger road or highway, which is consistent with on-off ramp infrastructure.
