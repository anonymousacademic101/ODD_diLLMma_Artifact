The road does not display the typical characteristics of an on-off ramp commonly seen on highways or freeways, such as tapering lanes or signage indicating the transition between highway speeds and local road speeds. Instead, the image shows a stoplight and a no-right-turn sign, which are typical of urban or suburban intersections rather than highway ramps.
