The image you provided shows a vehicle at an intersection, not an on-off ramp. It appears to be a typical city street or suburban road with vehicles waiting to either cross the intersection or make a turn. On-off ramps typically connect highways to local roads and have a more defined curve for vehicles to decelerate when exiting highways or to accelerate when merging onto them. The setting in the image lacks the characteristics of an on-off ramp, such as highway signage, acceleration/deceleration lanes, and the proximity to a highway.
