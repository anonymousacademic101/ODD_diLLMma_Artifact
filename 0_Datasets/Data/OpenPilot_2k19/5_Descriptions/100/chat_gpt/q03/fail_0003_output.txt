NO.

The road pictured does not appear to be an on-off ramp. It seems to be a drive-thru lane for a business, such as a fast-food restaurant, which is supported by the presence of a service window on the left and the typical features of a drive-thru layout, including a queue of cars. On-off ramps are typically associated with highways or major roads, where vehicles use them to enter or exit at higher speeds, which is not the context depicted in this image.
