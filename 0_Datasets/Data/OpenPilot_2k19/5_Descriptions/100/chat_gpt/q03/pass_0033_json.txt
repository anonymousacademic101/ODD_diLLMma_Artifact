On-off ramps generally have single lanes or are marked by solid lines that diverge or converge with the main roadway. The traffic in the distance suggests a mainline highway with cars traveling at steady speeds, rather than the deceleration or acceleration patterns usually seen on on-off ramps.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
