The image shows a road at night, but the visible lane markings do not suggest it is an on-off ramp. On-off ramps typically have a more distinct curve, a clear entry or exit path from a larger highway, and often have different line markings or signs indicating entry to or an exit from the main road. This road appears to be a standard highway or roadway with multiple lanes, as indicated by the straight dashed lane markings.
