YES

This appears to be an on-off ramp due to several indicative features:

1. Lane Markings: The dashed white lines on the right-hand side suggest a lane that is exiting or merging, as it is common for on-off ramps to have such markings.

2. Roadside Signage: There is a yellow sign on the right with an arrow indicating a curve, which often signals an approaching exit or entrance ramp.

3. Deceleration Lane: The widening of the road to the right suggests a deceleration lane, which is typical for vehicles about to exit a highway.

These elements collectively imply that the road in question is indeed an on-off ramp.
