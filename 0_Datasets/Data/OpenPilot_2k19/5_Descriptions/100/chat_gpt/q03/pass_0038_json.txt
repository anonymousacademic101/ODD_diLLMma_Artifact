There is a solid white line and dashed white lane markings typical of main travel lanes, and multiple lanes can be seen, which is consistent with a highway rather than an on-off ramp, which is typically a single lane leading to or from the main travel lanes of a highway. Additionally, the vehicles are spaced out and traveling in parallel, typical for main lanes of traffic, not merging or exiting, as one would expect to see on an on-off ramp.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
