NO.

The image shows a multi-lane highway with multiple vehicles traveling at what appears to be highway speeds. The presence of overhead signage with destinations and distances typical of highway markers, as well as the clear dividing lines between lanes, suggests that this is a main thoroughfare rather than an on-off ramp. On-off ramps typically have fewer lanes, are designed for slower speeds to facilitate the transition between highways and local roads, and usually have signage indicating an exit or entrance to a highway rather than destination distances. The road in the image does not display characteristics consistent with an on-off ramp.
