NO.

The road does not appear to be an on-off ramp typically associated with highways or freeways. Instead, it looks like a regular urban street, possibly within a commercial area, given the presence of office buildings and parked cars on the side of the street. On-off ramps usually have specific signage, markings, and are designed to facilitate the smooth transition of vehicles to and from highways, which is not evident in this image.
