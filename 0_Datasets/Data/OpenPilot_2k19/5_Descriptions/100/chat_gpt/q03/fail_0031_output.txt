This does not appear to be an on-off ramp. The image shows a vehicle that seems to be in a parking lot or a driveway in front of a building. The markings on the ground are typical for parking areas, directing traffic flow, and there is a curb and entrance to a building visible. On-off ramps are typically connected with highways or freeways and do not have direct access to building entrances like this.
