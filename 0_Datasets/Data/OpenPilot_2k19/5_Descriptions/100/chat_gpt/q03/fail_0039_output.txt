The image shows a vehicle stopped at a traffic signal on a multi-lane road. An on-off ramp typically refers to the ramps connecting highways or freeways to local roads. On-off ramps usually do not have traffic signals directly on them; they lead to intersections where there might be signals. This road appears to be a regular surface street with a traffic light, which would not be characteristic of an on-off ramp.
