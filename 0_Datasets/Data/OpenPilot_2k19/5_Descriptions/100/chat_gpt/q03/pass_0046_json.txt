The cars seem to be traveling at highway speeds rather than slowing down to exit or accelerating to merge. This suggests that the roadway is likely a section of a multi-lane highway, not an on-off ramp. On-off ramps typically have clear signage and are designed for vehicles to decelerate when exiting or accelerate when entering a highway.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
