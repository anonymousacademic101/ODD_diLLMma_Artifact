NO.

The road in the image appears to be a regular intersection, not an on-off ramp. On-off ramps are typically associated with highways or freeways and are designed to allow vehicles to enter or exit at higher speeds. The intersection here seems to be for a local street with traffic lights and cross traffic, which suggests it is part of a standard road network rather than an on-off ramp system.
