The lanes are marked with dashed lines, indicative of a highway or freeway where traffic flows continuously. On-off ramps are typically single-lane roads that serve as connectors between main roads or highways and local roads, with distinct curvature or tapering to facilitate the merging process. The absence of such features suggests that this is not an on-off ramp.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
