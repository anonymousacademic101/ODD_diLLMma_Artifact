NO.

Based on the view from the windshield, this does not appear to be an on-off ramp. On-off ramps typically connect highways to local roads and have a distinct curved design to accommodate vehicles slowing down or accelerating to merge with highway traffic. The road in the image seems to be a normal roadway possibly at an intersection, indicated by the road markings suggesting turn options. There are no visible signs or road designs typical for highway ramps, such as merge lanes or acceleration/deceleration lanes.
