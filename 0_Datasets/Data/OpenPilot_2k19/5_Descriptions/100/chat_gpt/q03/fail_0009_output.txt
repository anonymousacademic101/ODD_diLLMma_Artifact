NO.

The image shows a vehicle with its dashboard visible in the foreground and a view through the windshield of what appears to be a gas station to the right and some red traffic lights ahead. The environment does not have the usual characteristics of an on-off ramp, such as highway signage, dedicated acceleration or deceleration lanes, or the typical merging patterns. Instead, it appears to be a general road near a commercial area where the gas station is located. The presence of a gas station directly adjacent to the road is atypical for an on-off ramp, which are usually connected to faster highways where direct commercial access is not common. The traffic lights suggest a controlled intersection, which is not a usual feature of an on-off ramp either.
