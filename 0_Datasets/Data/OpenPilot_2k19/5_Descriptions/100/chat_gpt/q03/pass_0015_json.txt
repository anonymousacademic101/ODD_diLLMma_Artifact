On-off ramps typically are single lanes that diverge from or merge into the highway traffic and are designed for decelerating when exiting or accelerating when entering the traffic flow. The presence of multiple lanes, the flow of traffic, and the lack of evident merging or diverging lanes suggest this is not an on-off ramp.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
