NO.

Based on the image provided, it does not appear to be an on-off ramp typically used for entering or exiting freeways or motorways. This stretch of road looks more like an urban street or roadway due to the presence of a gas station directly adjacent to the road, a traffic signal ahead, and other vehicles that are driving or parked in a manner consistent with city traffic. On-off ramps usually do not have direct access to businesses such as gas stations and typically lack features such as stoplights, as these are engineered for smooth transitions to and from higher-speed roadways. The image suggests standard urban traffic conditions rather than the specific features of an on-off ramp.
