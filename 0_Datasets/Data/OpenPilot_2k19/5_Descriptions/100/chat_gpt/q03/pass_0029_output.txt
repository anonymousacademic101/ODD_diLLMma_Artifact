This does not appear to be an on-off ramp. The image shows a vehicle on a multi-lane highway with traffic traveling in the same direction, which is characteristic of a regular highway or interstate. On-off ramps typically have one lane and are used to enter or exit a highway, but this appears to be a section of the main travel lanes of a highway.
