NO.

The road in the image appears to be a multi-lane highway or freeway, not an on-off ramp. There are multiple lanes of travel in the same direction without any indication of merging or diverging traffic that would be indicative of an on-ramp or off-ramp. The overhead sign also lists multiple avenues, which is typical for mainline freeway signs indicating upcoming exits rather than being on a ramp.
