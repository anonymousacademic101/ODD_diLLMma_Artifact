The road does not appear to be an on-off ramp. It looks like a regular street or road with businesses on the sides, a median to the left, and no visible signs or indicators that would typically accompany an on-off ramp such as highway entrance or exit signs, acceleration or deceleration lanes, or merging traffic. It appears to be more of an arterial road that provides access to the commercial parking lots and businesses visible in the image.
