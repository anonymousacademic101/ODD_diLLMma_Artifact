The road in the image is not an on-off ramp; rather, it appears to be a multi-lane highway or freeway. The signage indicates exits for Hickey Blvd and Eastmoor Ave, suggesting that this is a main thoroughfare with exits rather than an on-off ramp which typically serves as a transition between roads.
