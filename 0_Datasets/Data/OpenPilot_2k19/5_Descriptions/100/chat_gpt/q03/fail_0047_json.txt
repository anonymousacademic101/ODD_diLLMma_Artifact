The road in the image is curving to the right, and there are visible markings typical of a regular roadway, but it lacks the distinct characteristics of an on-off ramp such as signage indicating entrance or exit to a highway, merging lanes, or acceleration/deceleration lanes. On-off ramps typically facilitate the transfer between different types of roads, such as from a highway to a local street or vice versa, and this road doesn't display those features."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
