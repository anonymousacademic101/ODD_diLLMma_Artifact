The presence of the traffic light and the merging lane, along with overhead road signage that typically indicates the directions for highway entrances and exits, hint that we might be on an on-off ramp leading onto a highway or a significant road. Additionally, the lane we are driving on is diverging from the main lanes of traffic, which is characteristic of an on-off ramp.
