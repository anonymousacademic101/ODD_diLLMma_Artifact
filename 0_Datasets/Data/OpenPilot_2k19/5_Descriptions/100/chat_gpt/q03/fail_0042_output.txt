NO.

The road depicted in the image appears to be a regular street or road rather than an on-off ramp. On-off ramps typically connect highways to local roads and usually feature acceleration and deceleration lanes. The setting in the image looks more like a city or suburban street with trees and a sidewalk visible on the right side, parked vehicles, and multiple lanes of traffic without the distinguishing characteristics of a highway on-off ramp.
