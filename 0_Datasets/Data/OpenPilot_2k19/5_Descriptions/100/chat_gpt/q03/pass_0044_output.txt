The road you are driving on appears to be a main travel lane of a highway or freeway, not an on-off ramp. On-off ramps are typically single lanes diverging from or merging onto the main roadway and are used for entering or exiting the main flow of traffic. The image shows multiple lanes of traffic traveling in parallel, consistent with a regular section of a multi-lane highway.
