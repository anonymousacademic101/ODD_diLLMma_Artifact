On-ramps and off-ramps are usually connecting roads that facilitate the transition between a highway and a local road. They are often characterized by a distinct curve or turning motion and are specifically designed for accelerating to enter the highway or decelerating to exit to a local road. Additionally, they generally do not have cross streets or intersections.\n\nIn contrast, this road appears relatively straight, there are no visible signs or markings that indicate it is an on-ramp or off-ramp, and there are multiple lanes with cars parked along the side, suggesting it is a regular street rather than a ramp. Furthermore, we can see buildings and trees close to the road, which is more typical for urban or residential streets than for highway ramps.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
