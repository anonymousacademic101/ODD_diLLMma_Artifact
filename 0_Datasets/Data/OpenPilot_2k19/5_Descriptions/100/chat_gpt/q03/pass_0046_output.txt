The image shows multiple lanes of traffic moving in the same direction with no indication of an exit or entrance lane beginning or ending. The cars seem to be traveling at highway speeds rather than slowing down to exit or accelerating to merge. This suggests that the roadway is likely a section of a multi-lane highway, not an on-off ramp. On-off ramps typically have clear signage and are designed for vehicles to decelerate when exiting or accelerate when entering a highway.
