The image provided appears to show a line of vehicles waiting at a traffic point, likely at an intersection or a traffic signal on a regular road, rather than an on-off ramp. The presence of signage and retail outlets (as indicated by the storefront of "Verizon" in the image) suggests this is an urban or suburban area with standard road infrastructure as opposed to the limited-access features typically associated with highway on-off ramps. Additionally, on-off ramps usually do not have such direct access to retail storefronts or the types of vegetation shown in the median.
