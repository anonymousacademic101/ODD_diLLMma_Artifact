On-off ramps typically have specific features such as signs indicating an exit or entrance to a highway, and generally lead to or from high-speed, limited-access roads such as freeways or motorways. This image does not clearly show such signage or road characteristics commonly associated with on-off ramps. Instead, the road appears to be a winding road through a more rural or park-like setting, which suggests it's a regular roadway rather than an on-off ramp."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
