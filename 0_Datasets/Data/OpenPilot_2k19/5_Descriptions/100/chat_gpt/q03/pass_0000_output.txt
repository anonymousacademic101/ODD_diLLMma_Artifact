YES.

The road appears to be an on-off ramp due to several indicators: the curving lane lines indicating that the road curves away from the main lanes, the presence of signage in the distance that seems to be guiding drivers into different directions (which is common at the end of ramps where drivers must choose a direction to continue), and the exit-only lane markings often found on such ramps. Additionally, the way other vehicles are positioned, using separate lanes, suggests a divergence point commonly found where a ramp intersects with a highway or another road.
