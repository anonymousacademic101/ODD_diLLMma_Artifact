The scene depicts an intersection with traffic lights and multiple lanes, indicating a standard road junction rather than an on-off ramp, which would typically have a different configuration to facilitate the merging of traffic onto or off of a freeway. On-off ramps usually connect highways to local roads with either yield signs or merge signs instead of traffic lights.
