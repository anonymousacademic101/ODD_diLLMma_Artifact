This does not appear to be an on-off ramp. The road has multiple lanes with traffic travelling in the same direction, which is typical of a highway or freeway main travel lane rather than an on-off ramp. On-off ramps typically have a single lane and are designed for vehicles to enter or exit the main flow of traffic from the highway.
