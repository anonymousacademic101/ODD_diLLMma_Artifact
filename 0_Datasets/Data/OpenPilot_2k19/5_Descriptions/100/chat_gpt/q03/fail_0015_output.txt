NO.

The road depicted in the image does not appear to be an on-off ramp typically associated with highways or freeways. On-off ramps are generally designed to allow vehicles to accelerate to or decelerate from the speed of the highway traffic, and they typically merge with or exit from the main lanes of a highway. The road in the image, however, shows a stop sign, which would be unusual for a highway on-off ramp as they usually utilize yield or merge signs to facilitate the smooth flow of traffic. Additionally, the landscape and design of the intersection suggest a more local road or a street in a suburban or urban area rather than an on-off ramp.
