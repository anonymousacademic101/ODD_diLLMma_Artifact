NO.

The road in the image does not appear to be an on-off ramp typically associated with highways or freeways. Instead, it looks like a regular city street intersection, controlled by traffic lights, and leading into a more residential or commercial area rather than a highway. The presence of crosswalks, traffic signals, and the layout of the road suggest that it's not designed for merging on or off high-speed traffic lanes but for regular urban traffic control.
