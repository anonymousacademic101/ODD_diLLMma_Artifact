On-off ramps typically connect highways to local roads and do not have traffic signals regulating the flow of the traffic entering or exiting the highway. Instead, they often have yield or merge signs. The visible traffic signal and crosswalk markings suggest that this is more likely an intersection within a city or town rather than an on-off ramp.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
