NO.

Based on the image provided, there are several indicators that suggest this is not an on-off ramp. The road has multiple lanes with traffic moving in the same direction, typical of a main road rather than a ramp. The parked cars along the side of the road suggest that this is an urban street where on-street parking is permitted, which is not characteristic of an on-off ramp. On-off ramps typically facilitate the transfer of vehicles between different levels of roadways and do not include parking areas. Additionally, the straight path of the road, the lack of signage indicating an interstate or highway, and the presence of overhead street lights are more consistent with a standard urban street than an on-off ramp.
