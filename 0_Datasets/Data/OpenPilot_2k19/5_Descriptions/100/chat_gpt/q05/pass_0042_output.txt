NO

Based on the image provided, it is not possible to definitively determine whether there are restricted lanes such as those designated for buses or bicycles. The image shows a night-time scene with limited visibility and no visible signage or road markings that would indicate the presence of restricted lanes. However, without illuminated signs, clearer lane markings, or better lighting, it is not possible to confirm the presence or absence of restricted lanes with certainty.
