NO

Based on the image provided, there are no visible signs or markings on the road that would indicate the presence of restricted lanes such as those dedicated for bus use, bicycles, or carpools. The scene depicts a multi-lane highway with vehicles of various types occupying the lanes, and there is no clear demarcation or signage for restricted lanes. However, please note that my response is based solely on the visible section of the road within this image; there could be restricted lanes outside of this viewpoint or further along the road that are not visible here.
