NO

Based on the image provided, it appears to be a regular multi-lane highway at night with no clearly visible signs or markings indicating the presence of restricted lanes specifically designated for buses, bicycles, or other special vehicle categories. Restricted lanes, such as bus lanes or bike lanes, are typically marked with specific signs or road surface markings, none of which are discernible in the provided image. However, without further context or additional information outside of this specific view, it is not possible to conclusively determine the absence of restricted lanes elsewhere on this road.
