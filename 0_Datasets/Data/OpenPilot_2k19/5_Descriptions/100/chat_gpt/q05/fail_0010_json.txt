The picture quality makes it hard to discern specific details, but there are no visible signs or road markings that clearly denote restricted lanes, such as those designated for buses or bicycles. Restricted lanes typically have clear markings or signage, which are not apparent in this image. However, because the image is unclear, especially due to reflections and a wet windshield, it is difficult to be certain. Therefore, it is advisable for drivers to observe local traffic signs and road markings in person to ensure compliance with traffic laws.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
