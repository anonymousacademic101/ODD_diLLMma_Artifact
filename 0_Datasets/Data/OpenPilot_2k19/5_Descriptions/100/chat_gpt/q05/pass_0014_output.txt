The image shows a dashed lane marking on the right side that often indicates a lane that might be used for different purposes, such as parking, bus lane, or bicycle lane at certain hours. Although the specifics are not clearly visible, the type of lane marking suggests there could be restrictions. Additionally, there seems to be a sign on the right, but it's not readable in the image, so it could potentially indicate restrictions.
