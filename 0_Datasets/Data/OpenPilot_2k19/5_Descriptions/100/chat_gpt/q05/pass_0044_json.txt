Restricted lanes, such as those dedicated for bus use or bicycles, are usually clearly marked with road surface markings and/or signs. Given the lack of these markers and the presence of various personal vehicles across all lanes, we can deduce that there are no visibly restricted lanes on this section of the road. However, without additional context or signage that may be present outside of this image, we cannot be certain if there might be restricted lanes further along the road.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
