Based on the image provided, it appears we are in a parking lot rather than on a road. This location is typically used for parking cars, and any lanes present would be for the purpose of directing traffic within the lot itself. Parking lots generally do not have specific lanes reserved for buses or bicycles, as those are more common on public roads and dedicated transportation thoroughfares.
