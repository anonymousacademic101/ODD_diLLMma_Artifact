The image provided is low-resolution and taken at night, which makes it difficult to make out specific lane markings or road signs that would indicate the presence of restricted lanes such as bus lanes or bicycle lanes. Therefore, based on the information available in the image, we cannot confirm the presence of any restricted lanes. However, it is common in many areas for there to be dedicated lanes for buses or bicycles, but they would typically be marked with clear signage or road markings, which are not visible in this image.
