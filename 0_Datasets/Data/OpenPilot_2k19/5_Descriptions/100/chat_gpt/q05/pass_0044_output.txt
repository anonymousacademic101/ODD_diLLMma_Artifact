YES

From this image, we can see that the road is a multi-lane highway with no distinguishable signs or markings that indicate any lanes are specifically restricted for buses, bicycles, or any other particular type of vehicle. Restricted lanes, such as those dedicated for bus use or bicycles, are usually clearly marked with road surface markings and/or signs. Given the lack of these markers and the presence of various personal vehicles across all lanes, we can deduce that there are no visibly restricted lanes on this section of the road. However, without additional context or signage that may be present outside of this image, we cannot be certain if there might be restricted lanes further along the road.
