The image provided shows a nighttime scene on what appears to be a multi-lane highway with several vehicles but no immediately obvious signs or road markings that indicate the presence of a lane designated for buses, bicycles, or other specific types of traffic. Restricted lanes, such as bus lanes or bicycle lanes, are typically clearly marked with road signs or pavement markings, none of which are visible in this image. However, it is important to note that the lack of visibility could prevent the identification of some types of restrictions that may not be captured in this specific frame or angle.
