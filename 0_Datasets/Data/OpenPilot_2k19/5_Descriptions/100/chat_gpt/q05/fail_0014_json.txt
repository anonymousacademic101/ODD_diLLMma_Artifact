Although the resolution is not high enough to see specific signage or road markings that would confirm the nature of the restriction, it is common for bus lanes or bike lanes to be located in this area of a road. Given the usual placement of such lanes and the appearance of different pavement or lane markings, it's reasonable to deduce that there might be a restricted lane present."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
