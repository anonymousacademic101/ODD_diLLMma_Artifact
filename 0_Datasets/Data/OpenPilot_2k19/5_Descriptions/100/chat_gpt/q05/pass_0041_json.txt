You can identify this by the different texture and line style that separates it from the other vehicular traffic lanes. However, the resolution is not high enough to see any specific signage or road markings that would confirm its designation. Thus, it is important to look for any local traffic signs or street markings to verify the purpose of the lane before using it.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
