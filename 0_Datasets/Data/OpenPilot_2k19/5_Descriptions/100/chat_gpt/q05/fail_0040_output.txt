From the image provided, it appears that there is a lane on the right side of the road with a different surface texture, which is often indicative of a bus lane or a bike lane. It's a common practice in many places to designate a lane for exclusive or priority use by buses, bicycles, or other forms of transportation, and they are often marked by different road surface textures or colors, as well as corresponding signage and road markings. However, without clearer road markings or signage visible in the image, we cannot definitively determine the exact nature or restrictions of that lane.
