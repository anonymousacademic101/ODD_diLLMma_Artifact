The image shows a typical street scene with parallel-parked cars, and the view does not include any road markings that would suggest lane restrictions. However, it's important to note that the full layout of the road is not visible due to the angle and distance of the camera, so there might be restricted lanes not captured in this specific image."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
