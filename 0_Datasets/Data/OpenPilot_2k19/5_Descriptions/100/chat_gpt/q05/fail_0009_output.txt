The image provided is at a low resolution and taken at a time of low visibility, likely during the night or in poor weather conditions. Due to the lack of clarity, it is not possible to decisively identify any road markings or signs that would indicate the presence of restricted lanes such as bus lanes or bicycle lanes. Therefore, without such visible indicators, we cannot confirm that there are any restricted lanes on the road being driven on.
