NO.

The image shows a vehicle driving through what appears to be a drive-thru lane of a fast-food restaurant, not a public road with traffic lanes that could have restrictions for buses or bicycles. Drive-thru lanes are dedicated to motor vehicles being serviced by the restaurant and aren't a part of public road infrastructure where lane restrictions would apply.
