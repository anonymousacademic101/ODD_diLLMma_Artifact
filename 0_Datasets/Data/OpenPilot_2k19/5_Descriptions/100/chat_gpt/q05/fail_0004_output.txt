NO

Based on the image provided, there are no visible indications that the lane we are driving in is specifically restricted for use by buses, bicycles, or any other type of vehicles. There are no road markings or signs apparent in the view that designate the lane as restricted. The bus seen on the right is stopped at a separate area which seems to be a bus bay or stop, rather than a designated bus lane on the road itself.
