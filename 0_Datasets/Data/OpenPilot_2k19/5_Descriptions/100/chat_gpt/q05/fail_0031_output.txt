NO.

The image provided appears to show a parking lot rather than a public road with traffic lanes. Parking lots typically do not have designated lanes for buses or bicycles. Instead, they have parking spaces and driveways for vehicles to maneuver into those spaces. The road markings visible in the image seem to be for guiding vehicles within the parking area rather than indicating any kind of restricted traffic lanes.
