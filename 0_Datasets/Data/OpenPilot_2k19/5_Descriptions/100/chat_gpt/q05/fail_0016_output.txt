YES

Based on the information available in the image provided, it appears that there is a dedicated bus lane. While we cannot see the full road markings in this image, the glimpse of a diamond symbol on the road surface, typically used in various regions to denote reserved lanes (like bus or carpool/HOV lanes), suggests the presence of a restricted lane. However, I cannot confirm if there is a specific lane for bicycles due to the limitations in the view.
