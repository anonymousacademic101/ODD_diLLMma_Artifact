It appears from the context that you are not actually on a public road, but rather in a drive-thru lane for a restaurant, judging by the proximity of the building and the presence of a service window. This drive-thru lane is not a public road with marked lanes for buses or bicycles, but rather a private pathway designed for motor vehicles to queue and access a business service.
