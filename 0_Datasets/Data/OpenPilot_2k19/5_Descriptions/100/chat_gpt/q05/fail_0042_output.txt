From the visible information in the image, there are no clear indications of a dedicated bus lane or bicycle lane on the road we are driving on. There are multiple lanes for vehicles, and no markings or signage visible that would indicate any restrictions for specific types of vehicles such as buses or bicycles. Without such markers or signs, we cannot conclude that there are restricted lanes present.
