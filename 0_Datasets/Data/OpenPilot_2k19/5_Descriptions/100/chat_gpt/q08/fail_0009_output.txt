NO

The reason is that the image shows a view from a vehicle where the immediate road ahead appears to be part of a parking space or a stopping area, possibly at a gas station. There is no evidence in this frame of a narrow or winding road. The view is not of an open road but of a built-up location, so it cannot be determined if the road beyond this area is narrow or winding.
