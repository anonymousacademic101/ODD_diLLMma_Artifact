NO.

The road shown in the image is a multi-lane highway, with clearly marked lanes and ample space for vehicles to travel side by side. It is not narrow, as there are multiple lanes in one direction, and it is not winding, as we can see the road stretching straight ahead for a considerable distance without any sharp turns or bends in sight.
