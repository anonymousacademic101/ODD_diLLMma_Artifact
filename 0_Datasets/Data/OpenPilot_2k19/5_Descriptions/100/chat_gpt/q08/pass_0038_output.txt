NO.

The road in the image appears to be a multi-lane highway with no immediate sharp turns or bends that would classify it as winding. In addition, the lanes are clearly marked and wide enough to accommodate vehicular traffic without the confines often associated with narrow roads. The visibility is good and there are multiple lanes for traffic, suggesting it is a well-maintained road designed for consistent and moderate-to-high speed travel, not the characteristic of a narrow, winding road.
