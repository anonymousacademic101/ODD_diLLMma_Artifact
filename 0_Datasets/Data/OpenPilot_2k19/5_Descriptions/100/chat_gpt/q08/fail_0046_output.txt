YES.

Based on the perspective offered in the image, it seems that the road ahead features a curve veering to the right, suggesting that it is winding. However, the road does not appear to be particularly narrow; it has two lanes and seems to be of standard width for a rural or suburban roadway. There's adequate space for vehicles in both directions, indicating that the road is not narrow. The term "narrow" is relative and could be subject to personal interpretation, but in the context of road design, this road would not typically be considered narrow.
