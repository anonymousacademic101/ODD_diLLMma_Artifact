The presence of a winding road sign indicates that the road ahead has curves or bends. Although the width of the road cannot be determined with certainty from this single image, the presence of curves typically implies the road may have varying widths or be perceived as narrower in places due to the turns. The guardrail also suggests caution for potentially sharp bends or steep drop-offs.
