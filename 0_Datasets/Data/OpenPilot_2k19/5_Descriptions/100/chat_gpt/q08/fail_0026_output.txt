NO.

Based on the image provided, we are not driving on a narrow and winding road. The image shows a road at night with multiple lanes as indicated by both the presence of multiple vehicles aligned in parallel and the visible lane markings. The vehicles are stopped, suggesting a traffic light or congestion ahead, and the setting appears to be an urban or suburban environment, which typically includes straight and wider roads rather than narrow, winding ones. The road looks straight as far as the image allows us to see, and no winding path can be discerned from this vantage point.
