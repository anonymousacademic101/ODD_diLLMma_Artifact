NO.

The road in the image appears to be a multi-lane highway with ample space between lanes and a divider separating the opposite directions of traffic. It is not narrow as the lanes are wide enough for standard vehicles to pass comfortably. Moreover, the road in the view seems straight at this section, without visible tight bends or curves that would classify it as winding.
