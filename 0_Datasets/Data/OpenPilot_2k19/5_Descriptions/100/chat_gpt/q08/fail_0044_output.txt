The image shows a road that appears to be wide with multiple lanes, and it has a traffic light-controlled intersection ahead. There are no visible sharp turns or winding paths in the immediate view, which would characterize a road as "narrow and winding." The road in the image looks to be straight and designed to handle significant traffic volume, which suggests that it is neither narrow nor winding in the section presented.
