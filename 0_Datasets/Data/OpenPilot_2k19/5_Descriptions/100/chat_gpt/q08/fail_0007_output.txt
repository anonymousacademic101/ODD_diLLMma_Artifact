The road in the image appears to be a regular, straight residential street rather than a narrow and winding road. The road is marked with clear lane divisions, there's a defined intersection with stop signs, and the presence of roadside parking and urban infrastructure suggests it's not a narrow or winding road typical of rural or mountainous areas.
