NO

The road visible in the image does not appear to be narrow and winding. It seems to be a straight segment of an urban or suburban road with multiple lanes, and there are parked cars on the side. The visibility of stop lines and signage indicates that the road is part of a standard traffic grid, which typically has wider lanes to accommodate various types of vehicles and traffic situations. Winding roads are more common in rural or mountainous areas and are characterized by frequent curves and turns, which are not present in this view.
