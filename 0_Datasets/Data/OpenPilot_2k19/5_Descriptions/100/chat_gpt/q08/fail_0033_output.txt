NO

The road in the image appears to be a wide, multi-lane road with distinct road markings for traffic lanes. It is not narrow and there are no visible curves in this section to suggest that it is winding. Additionally, the presence of a traffic light and intersection indicates a more urban and structured road layout, rather than a narrow, winding country or mountain road.
