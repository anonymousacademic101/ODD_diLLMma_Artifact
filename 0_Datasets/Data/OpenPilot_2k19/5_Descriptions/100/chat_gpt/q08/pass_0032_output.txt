NO

The road depicted in the image appears to be relatively straight and wide, with multiple lanes for traffic. There are no visible sharp curves or indications of narrowness that would typically characterize a "narrow and winding" road. The lanes are clearly marked, and there's enough space for vehicles to travel alongside each other, which suggests that the road is designed for steady traffic flow without the tight constraints of a narrow path.
