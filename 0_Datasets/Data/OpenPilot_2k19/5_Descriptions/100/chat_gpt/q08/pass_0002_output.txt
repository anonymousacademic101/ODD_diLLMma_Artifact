NO.

The road in the image appears to be a multi-lane highway, which typically means it is wider and designed for higher speeds. It's hard to discern any severe bends or curves that would indicate it's winding, as the visible stretch of road seems straight. The lanes are clearly marked, and there is ample space between them. Winding roads tend to be narrower with more abrupt turns and are less likely to have multiple lanes in each direction.
