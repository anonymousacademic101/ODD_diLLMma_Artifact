The road in the image appears to be a standard two-lane road with adequate width for vehicles to travel in both directions comfortably. While there is a curve in the road ahead, it does not look excessively tight or winding from this perspective. Thus, based on this single image, it does not appear to be particularly narrow or winding overall.
