NO.

The road in the image is a multi-lane highway, which appears to have at least three lanes in the direction we are looking. The lanes are well-marked and there is no indication of any sharp turns or significant bends in the immediate distance, suggesting that the road is not winding. Moreover, the scale of the vehicles and the presence of multiple lanes side by side implies that the road is not narrow but rather a standard or wide highway.
