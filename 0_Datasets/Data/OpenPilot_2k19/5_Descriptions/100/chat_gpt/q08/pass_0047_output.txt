The visible road from the perspective shown in the image appears to be a straight and multi-lane urban road with distinct lane markings, not a narrow and winding road. The vehicles are stopped at a traffic signal, which suggests it is a typical city street intersection designed for regular traffic flow and not the characteristics of a narrow, winding road.
