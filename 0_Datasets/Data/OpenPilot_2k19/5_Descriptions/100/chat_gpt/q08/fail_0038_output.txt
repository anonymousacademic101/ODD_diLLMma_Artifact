NO

The reason for this answer is that the image depicts a situation where the vehicle appears to be stopped at a traffic light with multiple lanes visible, indicating it's not a narrow road. There are no visible sharp turns or twists that would classify it as winding. Instead, the scene looks like an intersection in a typical urban or suburban environment with other vehicles and buildings around, suggesting a standard-width road with organized traffic flow.
