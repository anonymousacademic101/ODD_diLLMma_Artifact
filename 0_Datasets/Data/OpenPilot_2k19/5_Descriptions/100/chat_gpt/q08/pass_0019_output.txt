NO.

The road shown in the image is not narrow and winding; it appears to be a wide multi-lane highway with straight sections visible in the immediate view. There are multiple lanes in the same direction, marked by clear lane lines, and there is no evidence of sharp bends or turns that would characterize a winding road.
