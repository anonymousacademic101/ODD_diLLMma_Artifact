The road in the image appears to be a multi-lane highway with broad lanes and gentle curves, if any. Narrow and winding roads typically have tight turns and a single lane or limited width for travel in each direction. This road does not exhibit those characteristics; it seems to be designed for higher-speed travel and has multiple lanes for traffic, indicating it is not narrow and winding.
