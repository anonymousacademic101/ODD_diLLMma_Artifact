There are no sharp curves or bends seen in this section of the road that would suggest it is winding. Instead, the road seems to stretch straight ahead into the distance with a slight curve to the right that doesn't qualify as winding."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
