NO

The road in the image is not narrow and winding; it appears to be a multi-lane highway with dividing lines, indicating a wide roadway that allows for multiple vehicles to travel in parallel. There are no sharp curves or bends seen in this section of the road that would suggest it is winding. Instead, the road seems to stretch straight ahead into the distance with a slight curve to the right that doesn't qualify as winding.
