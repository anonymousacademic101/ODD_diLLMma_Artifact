NO

You are not driving on a road in this image; it appears to be a parking lot, indicated by the stationary cars parked in marked spaces, the presence of a shopping cart return area, and the facade of a Target store in the background, which is a typical feature of a commercial parking area. Parking lots are not described as narrow and winding, terms which are usually reserved for driving situations on actual roads or streets.
