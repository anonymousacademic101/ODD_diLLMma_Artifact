The road in the image appears to be a wide highway with multiple lanes and straight visible segments, rather than a narrow and winding one. The lanes are clearly marked, and there are no sharp bends or turns visible in the immediate view. The road also has barriers to the side, which is typical of larger, more substantial roads designed to accommodate higher speeds and more traffic.
