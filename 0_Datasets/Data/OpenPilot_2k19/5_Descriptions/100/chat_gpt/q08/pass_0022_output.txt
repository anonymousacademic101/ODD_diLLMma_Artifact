NO.

The road in the image appears to be a multi-lane road with relatively straight portions visible in the photograph. It does not display characteristics synonymous with narrow or winding roads, such as single lanes or sharp curves. Instead, the road has several lanes for traffic and seems to be reasonably straight where the photo has been taken.
