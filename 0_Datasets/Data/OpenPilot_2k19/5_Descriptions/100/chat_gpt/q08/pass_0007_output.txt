NO.

The image shows a vehicle queue in a drive-thru lane of a fast-food restaurant, which is not a road. While the path may be narrow due to the design of drive-thru lanes, typically to accommodate the width of a single vehicle, it is not a road in the traditional sense. The path does not appear to be winding; it seems to follow a relatively straight or slightly curved path typical of drive-thru lanes designed to wrap around a building.
