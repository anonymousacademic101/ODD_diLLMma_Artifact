The road in the image appears to be a multi-lane highway or major road which is straight at the section shown in the photograph. Narrow and winding roads are often characterized by single traffic lanes in each direction and visible curves or turns, which is not the case here. The lanes are marked and wide, and there's no immediate evidence of sharp bends or twists in the road ahead.
