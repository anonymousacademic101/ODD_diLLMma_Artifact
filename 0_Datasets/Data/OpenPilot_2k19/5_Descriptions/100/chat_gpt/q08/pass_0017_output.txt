The road in the image appears to be a multi-lane highway, which typically features straighter and wider lanes designed for higher-speed travel. It does not show the characteristics of a narrow and winding road, such as sharp curves or a single lane for each direction of traffic. The lanes are well-marked and the traffic is flowing in parallel lines, not navigating any tight or serpentine turns that would indicate a winding road.
