The lanes are marked clearly, suggesting sufficient width for regular traffic, and while we can see a slight curve to the right, it does not seem to be particularly sharp or winding. Additionally, there are visible traffic signals and signage indicating a more controlled traffic environment rather than a narrow, winding road typically found in rural or less urbanized areas. Moreover, the presence of parked cars along the side and multiple lanes for vehicles indicate the road is built to accommodate a fair volume of traffic, further suggesting that it's not especially narrow."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
