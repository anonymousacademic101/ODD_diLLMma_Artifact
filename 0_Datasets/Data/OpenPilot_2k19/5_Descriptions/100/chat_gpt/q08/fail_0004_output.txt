The road is not narrow or winding; it is a straight section divided into multiple lanes with clear lane markings, stoplights, and other traffic, indicating that it is a typical city street designed to accommodate various vehicles, including buses. The presence of buildings, traffic signals, and flat terrain suggests an urban setting with typical road width, not characteristic of narrow and winding roads, which are more commonly found in rural or mountainous areas.
