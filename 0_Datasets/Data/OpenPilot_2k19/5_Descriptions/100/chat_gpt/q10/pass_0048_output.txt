Drivers should pay attention to the green light (proceeding with caution), check for any pedestrians who might be crossing or about to cross the street, be mindful of oncoming traffic and any potential changes in traffic light signals. Additionally, since this is a nighttime scene, drivers should ensure their headlights are on and use appropriate night-driving precautions to account for reduced visibility.
