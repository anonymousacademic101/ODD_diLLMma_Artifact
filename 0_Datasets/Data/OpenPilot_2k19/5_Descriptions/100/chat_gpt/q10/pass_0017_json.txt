On the right side of the image, there is a green highway sign indicating an exit for "Hickey Blvd" above the highway lanes, with additional destinations listed: "Pacifica" and "E. Camino Ave" with the distance to this exit marked as "1 1/4" miles.\n\nThe road consists of at least three lanes in the direction the photo was taken, with the possibility of more lanes not visible in the image. The vehicle from which the photo was taken appears to be in the middle lane, following a red car at a safe distance. In the rightmost lane, there are two larger vehicles: a tanker truck followed by a yellow truck or a vehicle with a tall yellow structure, possibly related to highway maintenance or construction.\n\nThere are no visible pedestrians or crosswalks, which is typical for a highway setting. As for traffic, it seems relatively light, providing for smooth driving conditions. There is no apparent road construction or traffic congestion.\n\nDrivers on this road should maintain awareness of their speed, the distance between their vehicle and others (especially larger trucks), and be prepared to change lanes if needed for their desired exit. Given the highway signs, they should also be aware of vehicles potentially merging in preparation for the upcoming exits.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
