NO

Based on the image provided, there appears to be no visible construction activity on the road being driven on. There are no construction equipment, barriers, workers, or signs indicative of road works in the visible area. However, it's important to note that the visibility is not perfect and I can only make a statement based on the visible section of the road in this image.
