NO.

Based on the image provided, there are no visible signs of road construction such as construction equipment, barriers, workers, or signage typical of a construction zone. The nature of the vehicle congestion cannot be definitively linked to construction without such evidence. However, this assessment is based solely on the visible portion of the road within the frame of the image, and construction could be present outside of this view.
