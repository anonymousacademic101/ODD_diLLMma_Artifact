The image shows a road at night with several vehicles, traffic lights, and road markings visible. There are no clear signs of construction such as construction equipment, barriers, signs, or workers in the field of view. However, it's important to note that the image quality is not ideal for discerning all details, and the visible area is limited. Construction could exist beyond the field of view or be present but not clearly visible due to the nighttime conditions and limitations of the photograph.
