NO.

The image provided is not clear due to what appears to be motion blur, reflections, or possibly a dirty windshield, which obscures details. However, based on what is visible, there is no obvious signage, equipment, barriers, or other common indicators of road construction within the field of view. The scene mainly shows other vehicles on the road and a gas station to the right. Nonetheless, without a clearer image or additional context, it is not possible to conclusively determine the presence of construction beyond the visible area.
