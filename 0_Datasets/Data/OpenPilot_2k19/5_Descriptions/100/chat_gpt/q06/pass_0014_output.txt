The view through the windshield shows signs that might indicate construction ahead. Specifically, the presence of the white utility truck on the left might suggest some kind of work is being done, although this is not conclusive. There are no clear signs of construction like cones, barriers, or construction personnel visible in the image, but vehicles like the one shown are often associated with construction or repair work, which leads to the suggestion that construction may be present.
