NO.

The image provided is quite dark and blurry, which makes it challenging to determine specific details about the road conditions. There are no clear signs of construction such as cones, barriers, machinery, or construction signs that are visible in the image. The only sign visible appears to be a standard warning or information sign, typically found on highways, and not specifically indicative of construction. It is important to note that due to the low visibility, it cannot be definitively confirmed that there's no construction, but from what is discernible, there appears to be none.
