NO

The image shows a night scene taken from inside a vehicle, where no immediate signs of construction, such as construction equipment, barriers, active work crews, or roadwork signs, are visible. It appears to be a regular road with traffic signs indicating a curve ahead. However, without further context or a broader view, it cannot be definitively concluded that there is absolutely no construction on the road; only that none is visible in this particular image.
