NO.

Based on the image provided, it is nighttime and we can see that the road is illuminated by vehicle headlights. There is a guardrail to the side, and a sign is visible in the distance, but there are no clear indications of construction such as construction machinery, active workers, barriers specific to construction zones, or signage that typically denotes ongoing construction. Therefore, with the information available, it appears that there is no construction on this section of the road.
