It is difficult to determine if the visibility issues are specifically caused by heavy rain, snow, fog, or adverse weather conditions just by looking at this still image. However, the overall brightness is low, and details are hard to discern, which can be attributed to the low-light conditions of nighttime driving. There do not seem to be any clear indications of precipitation or fog in this specific frame, but the low visibility could potentially be worsened by such weather conditions if they were present.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
