NO.

The image does not depict heavy rain, snow, fog, or adverse weather conditions. The visibility issue here seems to be caused by the camera lens being dirty, smeared, or having some kind of obstruction on it, rather than an environmental condition like weather. The overall lighting and the visible sections of the environment suggest that visibility outside the car would be generally good if not for the dirty or smeared camera lens.
