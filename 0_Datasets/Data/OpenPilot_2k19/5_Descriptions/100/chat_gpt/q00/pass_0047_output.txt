The image does not show any immediate signs of heavy rain, snow, fog, or adverse weather conditions that would greatly impair visibility. The atmosphere appears hazy, but details such as traffic signals, vehicles, and other elements are still clearly visible. There may be some slight obscurity possibly due to smog or distant haze, but it does not constitute poor visibility as defined by the question.
