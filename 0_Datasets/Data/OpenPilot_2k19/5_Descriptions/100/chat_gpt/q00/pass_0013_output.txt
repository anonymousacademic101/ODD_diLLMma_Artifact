The image appears to be taken at night which naturally results in lower visibility conditions due to the lack of sunlight. However, there are no visible elements like rain, snow, or fog that would further impair visibility. The road is clear, and the vehicle's headlights illuminate the road ahead. The absence of rain streaks, snowflakes, or a foggy haze suggests that the poor visibility is due to it simply being nighttime rather than adverse weather conditions.
