The blurriness could be due to movement of the camera or vehicle from which the photo was taken, and not necessarily because of weather conditions. There don't appear to be raindrops, snowflakes, or foggy mist that would indicate adverse weather."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
