The image does not appear to have poor visibility due to heavy rain, snow, fog, or adverse weather conditions. The view is quite clear, and objects at various distances can be seen without any signs of such weather-related obstructions. Instead, the haze in the image may be due to a dirty or smudged camera lens or windshield through which the photo was taken.
