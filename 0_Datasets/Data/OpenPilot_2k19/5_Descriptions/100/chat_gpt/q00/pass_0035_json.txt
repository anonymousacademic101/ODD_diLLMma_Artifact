The road ahead is reasonably clear, and there are no visible precipitation or fog-related obstructions. However, the image is taken during twilight or early evening, which means natural light levels are low, which can reduce visibility but is not related to adverse weather conditions.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
