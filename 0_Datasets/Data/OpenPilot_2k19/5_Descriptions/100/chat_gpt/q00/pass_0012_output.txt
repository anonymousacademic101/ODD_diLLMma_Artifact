The image seems to show a scene with clear visibility on a highway during dusk or dawn, as indicated by the low natural light. The absence of precipitation or visible atmospheric conditions such as heavy rain, snow, or fog suggests that the visibility is not poor due to adverse weather conditions. The cars' headlights and street lights are on, probably due to the low natural light, not because of poor visibility caused by weather.
