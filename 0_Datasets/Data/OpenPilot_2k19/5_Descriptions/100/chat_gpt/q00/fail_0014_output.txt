YES

The reason for my answer is that there appears to be a reflection or glare on the windshield, which is reducing the visibility. While this isn't due to heavy rain, snow, fog, or typical adverse weather conditions, the effect is similar in that it obscures the driver's clear view of the road and surroundings, which can be considered a form of poor visibility.
