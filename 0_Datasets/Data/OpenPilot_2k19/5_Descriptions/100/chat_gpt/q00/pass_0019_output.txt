The image does not show signs of heavy rain, snow, fog, or adverse weather conditions that would significantly reduce visibility. The road is visible, overhead signs can be read, and the cars in the distance have their lights on but do not appear to be driving in conditions that would indicate poor visibility due to weather. It appears to be dusk or early evening based on the lighting, but not adverse weather conditions.
