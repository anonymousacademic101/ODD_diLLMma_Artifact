The image does not depict poor visibility caused by heavy rain, snow, fog, or adverse weather conditions. While the sky is overcast, which indicates that the weather could potentially be gloomy, there is no visible precipitation or fog that is significantly impairing visibility. The surroundings, cars, and buildings are clearly visible. The image could potentially have a slight glare or reflection that might affect clarity, but this is not the result of adverse weather conditions.
