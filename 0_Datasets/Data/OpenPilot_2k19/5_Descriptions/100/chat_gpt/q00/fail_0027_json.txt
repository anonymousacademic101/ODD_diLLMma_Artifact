While the image is somewhat dark, we can still see streetlights, vehicle lights, and the outlines of buildings and roads without the characteristic blur or obscurity that would be present in adverse weather conditions like heavy rain or fog. The absence of rain streaks, snowflakes, or a foggy atmosphere suggests that the visibility is not hindered by those factors.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
