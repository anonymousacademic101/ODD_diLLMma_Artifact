The image appears to have been taken during twilight or early evening, which indicates that the visibility issue is likely due to low light conditions rather than heavy rain, snow, fog, or other adverse weather conditions. While the image is somewhat dark, we can still see streetlights, vehicle lights, and the outlines of buildings and roads without the characteristic blur or obscurity that would be present in adverse weather conditions like heavy rain or fog. The absence of rain streaks, snowflakes, or a foggy atmosphere suggests that the visibility is not hindered by those factors.
