NO

The image does not show any visible signs of heavy rain, snow, fog, or adverse weather conditions. Visibility seems to be clear apart from the glare of lights which is normal for nighttime driving conditions. There are no streaks or blurs that would indicate precipitation, and no haze or low-lying clouds that would suggest fog. The illumination from the street lighting and vehicle lights appears normal and not diffused in a way that would signal adverse weather conditions. The image is simply a nighttime scene with vehicles stopped, likely at a traffic light, and the red tail lights are bright, but not indicative of poor visibility due to weather conditions.
