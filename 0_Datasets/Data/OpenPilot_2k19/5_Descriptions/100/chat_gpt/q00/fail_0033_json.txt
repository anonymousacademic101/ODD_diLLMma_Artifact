The sky is mostly clear with some haze or light fog in the distance, which is common in certain climates and does not constitute poor visibility as described. However, the quality of the image itself is low, causing the scene to appear blurry, but this is a characteristic of the image resolution or focus, not the actual visibility conditions at the scene.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
