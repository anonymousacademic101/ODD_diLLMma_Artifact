The image is dark because it seems to be taken at night, hence the visibility is poor due to low light rather than adverse weather conditions. There are no visible signs of heavy rain, snow, or fog in the image that would indicate poor visibility due to weather. Visibility issues in this image are instead due to the nighttime conditions and the limitations of the camera's exposure.
