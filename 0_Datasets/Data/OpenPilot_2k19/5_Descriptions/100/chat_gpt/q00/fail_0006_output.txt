NO

The image does not show any signs of heavy rain, snow, fog, or severe adverse weather conditions that would significantly reduce visibility. The sky is overcast, indicating cloudy weather, but details in the environment, such as vehicles, trees, and buildings, are visible with no apparent degradation due to poor weather conditions. The lack of rain streaks or snow on the ground, as well as clear definition in the surroundings, suggests visibility is not severely impaired.
