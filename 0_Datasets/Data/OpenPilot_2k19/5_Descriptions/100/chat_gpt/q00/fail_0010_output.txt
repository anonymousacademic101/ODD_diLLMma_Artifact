NO

The visibility in the image appears to be mostly clear, and there is no heavy rain, snow, or fog obscuring the view significantly. The main factor affecting visibility seems to be the wet windshield, which has caused some light distortion and water droplets to be visible. These effects suggest recent rain or some water on the windshield, but they do not indicate active adverse weather conditions that severely impair visibility.
