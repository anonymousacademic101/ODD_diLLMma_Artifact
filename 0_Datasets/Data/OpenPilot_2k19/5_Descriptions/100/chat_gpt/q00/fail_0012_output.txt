The image shown appears to be taken at night and does not exhibit the telltale signs of heavy rain, snow, or fog that would significantly impair visibility. There are no streaks or flakes that would indicate precipitation, nor is there a visible haze that would suggest fog. The overall darkness is more likely due to it being nighttime rather than adverse weather conditions. Visibility is limited primarily due to low light rather than weather phenomena.
