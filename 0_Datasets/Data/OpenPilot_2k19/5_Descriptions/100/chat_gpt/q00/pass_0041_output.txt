The image shows overcast or cloudy conditions, but there is no direct evidence of heavy rain, snow, fog, or other weather conditions severely impairing visibility. Objects in the distance are visible, and the road surface does not show signs of active precipitation such as rain or snow. There may be some haze, but it does not significantly reduce visibility.
