The visibility in the image is somewhat reduced, as indicated by the presence of fog or low clouds, especially in the upper part of the image where the skyline and the edges of the landscape are obscured by a grayish haze. This suggests that the driver's visibility may be slightly compromised at a distance, although the immediate road ahead is visible.
