YES

The visibility in the image is impaired, but not due to adverse weather conditions such as heavy rain, snow, or fog. Instead, the image seems to show droplets or dirt on the windshield of the vehicle from which the photo was taken. These marks on the windshield could cause the visibility to be perceived as poor. However, beyond the windshield, the weather outside appears to be clear.
