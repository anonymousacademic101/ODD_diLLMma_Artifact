YES

The image appears to show some raindrops on the windshield, which suggests that it's either raining or has just rained. While the visibility is not severely impaired, the presence of raindrops can be a sign of at least some weather-related visibility reduction. However, the extent of any visibility issues can't be fully assessed without more context, such as the intensity of the rain, which is not entirely clear from this single image.
