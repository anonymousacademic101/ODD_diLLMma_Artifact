The image does not appear to have poor visibility due to heavy rain, snow, fog, or adverse weather conditions. The clarity of objects at a distance, such as the restaurant signage and other vehicles, suggests that visibility is reasonable. The sky is also visible without signs of inclement weather. The image might be only slightly hazy, probably due to the camera lens or windshield being not entirely clear, which does not equate to adverse weather conditions affecting visibility.
