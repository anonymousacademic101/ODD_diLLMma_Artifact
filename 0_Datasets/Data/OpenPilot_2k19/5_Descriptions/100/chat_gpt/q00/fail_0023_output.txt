NO

The image does not appear to be affected by adverse weather conditions like heavy rain, snow, or fog. Instead, the poor visibility seems to be due to low lighting and the nighttime setting rather than weather-related issues. The image is dark and a bit grainy, which can happen with low-light photography, but there are no visible signs of precipitation or fog that would indicate severe weather conditions impairing visibility.
