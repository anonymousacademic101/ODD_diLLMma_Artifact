The overall visibility in the photo seems clear, and the sky visible at the end of the overpass appears to be relatively bright, suggesting there is no severe weather present in the immediate area. The darkness in the image appears to be due to the contrast between the shaded area under the overpass and the brighter conditions outside of it, which can create a temporary adjustment challenge for the human eye or a camera's light metering but does not indicate poor weather conditions."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
