The image does not show definitive signs of poor visibility due to heavy rain, snow, fog, or adverse weather conditions, but it is blurry and taken in low-light conditions which might give the impression of poor visibility. The blurriness could be due to movement of the camera or vehicle from which the photo was taken, and not necessarily because of weather conditions. There don't appear to be raindrops, snowflakes, or foggy mist that would indicate adverse weather.
