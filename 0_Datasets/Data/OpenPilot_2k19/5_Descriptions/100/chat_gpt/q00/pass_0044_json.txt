The sky is clear and the surroundings are visible, indicating that the weather is fair. The visibility issue in this image seems to be due to the camera angle capturing part of the vehicle's interior, which obstructs the view. Specifically, the windshield wiper in the foreground is partly obscuring the image, but this is not related to weather conditions."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
