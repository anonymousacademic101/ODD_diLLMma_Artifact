The clarity of the objects and details in the image suggest that the lens through which the picture was taken was not covered or obstructed by mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products. While the overall image might have areas of shadow and glare due to the angle of the sunlight and the limitations of the camera's dynamic range, there is no evidence of any substance on the camera lens itself that would distort or block the image.
