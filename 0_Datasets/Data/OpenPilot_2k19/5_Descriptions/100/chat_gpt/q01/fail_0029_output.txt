The image is clear and there are no visible signs of obstruction, covering, or damage by mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products on the camera lens. What is visible on the bottom edge of the image seems to be a reflection on the dashboard of the vehicle from which the photo was taken, not an impediment on the camera itself.
