NO

The image appears blurry, particularly around the light sources, which suggests that the blurriness may not be the result of an obstruction such as mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products over the camera lens, but rather due to the camera being out of focus or motion blur due to a moving vehicle or shaky hands. There are no obvious signs of residue or smears that would indicate such obstructions. Moreover, the lack of clarity could also be caused by low light conditions, as the scene seems to be captured during dusk or dawn, which typically challenges camera sensors, especially if the camera has limited low-light capabilities.
