The image is clear and shows no signs of distortion or obstruction that would indicate the camera lens was covered or damaged by mud, ice, snow, paint, or adhesive products. The overall darkness in the image might be due to the lighting conditions under the overpass and a high dynamic range scenario, where the camera is adjusting for the brighter light outside the overpass, causing the inside area to appear darker.
