The details of the vehicles on the road and the surrounding environment are visible without any distortion that would indicate such damage. However, the image does have a slight blurriness which could be attributed to the camera being out of focus, motion blur, or atmospheric conditions such as fog rather than an obstruction on the lens.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
