The picture is relatively clear, with visible lights from vehicles and streetlights, indicating that the camera lens was not significantly obstructed or damaged by such substances. The darkness and low visibility are consistent with nighttime driving conditions rather than a camera malfunction or obstruction.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
