YES

The image has blurry areas, particularly around the edges, which are consistent with an obstruction like mud, water droplets, or some other substance on the lens or cover of the camera. This can occur when the camera is inside a vehicle and the windshield through which the image is taken is dirty or has residue on it. The clarity of the image is affected, leading to the conclusion that some form of obstruction is present. The central part of the image is clearer than the edges, indicating the obstruction is not uniform across the lens or cover.
