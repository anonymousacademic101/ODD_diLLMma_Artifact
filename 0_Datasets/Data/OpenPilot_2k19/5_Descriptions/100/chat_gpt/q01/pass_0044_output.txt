NO.

The camera itself does not seem to be obstructed, covered, or damaged by mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products. The image is clear apart from the obstruction caused by the wiper or similar object in the foreground. This suggests the camera lens is clean and the obstruction is due to an object within the vehicle's interior, not something on the lens itself.
