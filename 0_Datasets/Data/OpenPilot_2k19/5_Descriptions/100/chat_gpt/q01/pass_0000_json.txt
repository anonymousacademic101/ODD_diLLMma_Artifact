However, there is no clear evidence that the camera lens was obstructed, covered, or damaged by mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products. The clarity of the road lines, the reflections of car lights, and readable signs suggest the image clarity is primarily affected by the lighting conditions rather than an obstruction on the camera.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
