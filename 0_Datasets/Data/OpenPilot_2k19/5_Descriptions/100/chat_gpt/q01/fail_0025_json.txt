However, there is no definitive evidence of mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products specifically causing the obstructions. The distortions are more indicative of something like a dirty or wet lens or glass rather than a heavy or opaque substance directly on the camera lens.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
