NO.

The image appears to be somewhat blurry, particularly towards the edges, which may suggest motion blur or a low light setting leading to a slower shutter speed. This might give the impression of an obstruction, but there are no clear signs of mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products on the lens that would cause obstruction or damage; the details of the road, cars, and trees are discernible.
