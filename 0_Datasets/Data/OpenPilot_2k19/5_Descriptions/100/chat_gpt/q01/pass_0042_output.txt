NO.

The quality of the image suggests that it is likely taken in low-light conditions, potentially with a high ISO setting which results in noticeable digital noise and/or grain. The center of the image, where headlights illuminate the road, is clearer than the peripheries. This doesn't necessarily indicate that the camera was covered or obstructed by mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products, rather, it's an effect typical for photographs taken in dark settings with a camera that might not be optimized for low light. There are no obvious signs of obstructive material on the camera lens.
