The image appears blurry, but this effect could be the result of motion, a dirty windshield, or focus issues rather than direct obstruction, covering, or damage to the camera itself by substances such as mud, ice, snow, paint, or adhesive products. There are no clear signs of such materials on the lens of the camera that took the photo.
