The image provided appears to be taken through some semi-transparent material, likely a tinted screen or window, which has affected the clarity and color balance of the photograph. The overall image has a bluish tint, and the visibility is decreased, suggesting that the camera may have been behind a windshield with some form of tint or perhaps a sun-shielding film, which is obstructing clear sight, albeit not with mud, ice, snow, paint, or adhesives.
