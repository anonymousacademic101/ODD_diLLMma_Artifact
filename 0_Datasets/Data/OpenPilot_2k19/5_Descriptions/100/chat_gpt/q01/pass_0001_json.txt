There are no visible signs of mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, adhesive products, or other substances on the camera that took the image. Instead, the uniform diffusion of light and lack of any distinct pattern of smear or obstruction suggest that the haziness is caused by something in the air and not on the camera lens.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
