The image appears blurred and there is a noticeable distortion over the entire field of view, which suggests that the camera's lens could have been obstructed or covered by something like moisture, condensation, or a smudge, rather than being clean and clear. These artifacts are indicative of an obstruction on the camera lens, although it's not possible to determine exactly what the substance is. Mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products would also cause similar visual impairments if they were covering the camera.
