NO

The camera itself does not appear to be obstructed, covered, or damaged by mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products. The image does show some blur and artifacts that are indicative of something like moisture or a smudge on the windshield through which the photo was taken. This suggests that the quality issues are due to something on the glass in front of the camera, not on the camera lens itself.
