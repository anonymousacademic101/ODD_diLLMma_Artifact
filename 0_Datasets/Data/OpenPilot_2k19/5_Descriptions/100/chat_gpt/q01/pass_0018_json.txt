The clarity of most objects and the lack of any visible residue or damage to the image suggest the camera lens was reasonably clean and unobstructed at the time the image was taken. The blurriness present is more indicative of motion blur or low light conditions rather than an obstruction on the camera.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
