The image appears to have a relatively clear view of the scene. Although the bottom part of the image is slightly obscured by the interior of a vehicle, suggesting that the photo was taken from inside a car, there's no visible evidence of mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products obstructing, covering, or damaging the lens of the camera. The clarity of the picture, including readable street signs and visible details on the cars and buildings, indicates that the camera lens was not significantly obstructed by such substances.
