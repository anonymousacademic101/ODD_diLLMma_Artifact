NO.

The image appears blurry in certain areas, especially on the lower half, suggesting that it was taken from behind a glass, such as a windshield, which seems to be wet or dirty. This obscuration does not necessarily indicate that the camera itself was obstructed, covered, or damaged by mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products, but rather that there is an interference, such as moisture or dirt, on the windshield through which the photo was taken. The camera lens itself may still be in good condition.
