YES

The image appears to be blurry and lacks clarity, which suggests that the camera lens might be partially obstructed or covered by something, potentially one of the substances you mentioned like mud, ice, snow, or similar. While I cannot confirm the exact substance, the presence of a distortion that affects the image quality in this way typically indicates some form of obstruction over the camera lens.
