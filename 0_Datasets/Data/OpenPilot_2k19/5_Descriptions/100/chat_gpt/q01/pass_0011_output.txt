NO

The image itself shows no signs of obstruction, covering, or damage by mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products. However, there are some smudges and blur effects that suggest the camera lens might have been slightly dirty or the windshield through which the picture appears to have been taken may have been smudged or not entirely clean. These do not amount to the level of obstruction or damage as described in the question.
