These artifacts are indicative of an obstruction on the camera lens, although it's not possible to determine exactly what the substance is. Mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products would also cause similar visual impairments if they were covering the camera."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
