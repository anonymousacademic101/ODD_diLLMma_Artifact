YES

The image shows signs of distortions and blurring that could be indicative of an obstruction or something affecting the camera's lens or sensor, such as a smudge, condensation, or a translucent material partially covering the lens. The vignetting and pattern in the foreground of the image suggest that there might be some material like a film of moisture or another substance on the lens that is scattering the light and causing the image quality to degrade.
