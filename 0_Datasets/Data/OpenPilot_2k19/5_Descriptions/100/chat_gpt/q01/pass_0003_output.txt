The image you provided appears blurry, likely due to motion blur or low light conditions, not because of obstruction or damage from mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products. These conditions would typically present more distinct patterns or coverage on the lens. The edges of details are smeared, a common characteristic of motion blur, especially noticeable in night photography with insufficient lighting or a moving camera.
