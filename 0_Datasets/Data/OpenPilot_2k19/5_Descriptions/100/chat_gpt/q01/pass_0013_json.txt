The view appears to be clear, the lines on the road are visible, and there are no visible distortions suggesting something obstructing the lens. Instead, the quality of the image suggests it might have been taken in low light conditions or with a camera having a high ISO setting, which can result in graininess. It could also be affected by motion blur due to the speed of the vehicle.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
