YES

The image appears to have been taken through a windshield with water spots or a similar residue on it, which obstructs a clear view of the scene. While it's not necessarily mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products, there is an obstruction that somewhat distorts the image quality, indicating that the camera's field of view through the windshield is not completely clear.
