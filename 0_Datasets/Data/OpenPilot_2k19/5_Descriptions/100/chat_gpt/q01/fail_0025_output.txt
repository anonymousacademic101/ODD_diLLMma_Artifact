The image provided shows signs of visual obstructions due to what appears to be glare and reflections, as well as potential dirt or smudges on the lens or the medium (like a windshield) through which the photo was taken. However, there is no definitive evidence of mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products specifically causing the obstructions. The distortions are more indicative of something like a dirty or wet lens or glass rather than a heavy or opaque substance directly on the camera lens.
