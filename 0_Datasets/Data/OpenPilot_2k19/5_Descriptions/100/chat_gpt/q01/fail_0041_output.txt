YES

The smudge or blurred area in the upper central portion of the image suggests that something obstructed or came into contact with the lens or protective covering of the camera that took this photo. The smudge looks like it could be caused by a semi-transparent substance such as a smear or a small amount of mud, ice, or another substance. It's not clear enough to definitively identify the type of the material, but it is evident that the clarity of the image is compromised by whatever is causing the obstruction.
