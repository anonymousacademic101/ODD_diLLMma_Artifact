The view appears to be clear, with no visible detritus on the lens or the protective covering that might suggest such obstruction or damage. The blurriness and glare seen in the image are more characteristic of a low-light environment and possible reflections inside the vehicle, along with the limitations of the camera's sensor in dealing with direct artificial light sources at night."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
