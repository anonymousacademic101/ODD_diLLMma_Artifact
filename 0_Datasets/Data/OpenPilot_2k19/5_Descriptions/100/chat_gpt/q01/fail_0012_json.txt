The blurriness and the lighting conditions suggest it could be a result of motion blur, low light, or a combination of both. These effects are most likely due to the camera's movement and the speed of the car in relation to the exposure time of the camera, rather than an obstruction on the camera lens."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
