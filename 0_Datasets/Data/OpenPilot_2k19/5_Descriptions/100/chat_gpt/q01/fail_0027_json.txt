There are no obvious signs of residue or smears that would indicate such obstructions. Moreover, the lack of clarity could also be caused by low light conditions, as the scene seems to be captured during dusk or dawn, which typically challenges camera sensors, especially if the camera has limited low-light capabilities.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
