There is a small blemish near the center of the image that could be on the windshield or the camera lens; however, this does not seem significant enough to suggest that the camera was obstructed, covered, or damaged as described. The rest of the view is unobstructed and sharp, suggesting the camera was in good condition when the photo was taken.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
