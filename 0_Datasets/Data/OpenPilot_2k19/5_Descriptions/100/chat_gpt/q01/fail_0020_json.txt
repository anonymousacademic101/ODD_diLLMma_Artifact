However, there is a noticeable blur or haze affecting the image quality, which might suggest that the camera lens was smudged or there was a decrease in the camera's focus quality. This could be due to a dirty windshield, through which the photo was taken, or a smudge on the camera lens itself, neither of which constitutes damage by the substances you mentioned."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
