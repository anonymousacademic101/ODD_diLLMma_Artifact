The image appears to be taken through a windshield that has some dirt or water spots, which gives a slightly blurred effect to the image, particularly noticeable in the sky and lighter areas. However, the extent of this does not indicate that the camera itself was obstructed, covered, or damaged; rather, it suggests that the windshield through which the photo was taken may need cleaning. The details in the image are still quite discernible, and the obstruction does not seem to be on the camera lens itself.
