The clarity of the image, specifically the sharpness of details such as the edges of the road signs, the texture of the vegetation, and the vehicles in the distance, suggests that the camera lens was not obscured, covered, or damaged by mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products. If such substances had been present, they would typically distort the image clarity or create visible marks or smears.
