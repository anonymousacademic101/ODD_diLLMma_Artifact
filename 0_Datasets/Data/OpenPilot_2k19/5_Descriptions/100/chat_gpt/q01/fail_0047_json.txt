This can result in various visual artifacts, including blurriness or glare from dirt, dust, or smudges on the windshield. However, this doesn't necessarily mean the camera itself was obstructed, covered, or damaged by mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products. Instead, it's the windshield that could be dirty or have marks on it, which has affected the clarity of the captured image."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
