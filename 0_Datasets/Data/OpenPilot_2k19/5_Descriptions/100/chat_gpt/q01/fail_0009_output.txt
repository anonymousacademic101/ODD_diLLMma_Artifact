YES

The image provided appears blurry and has streaks that are consistent with an obstruction on the camera lens, such as water droplets, condensation, or a thin film of dirt or oil, which can scatter and diffuse light, leading to the effects observed. Although it's not possible to definitively say if the substance is mud, ice, snow, paint, or adhesive without more context, it is clear that the image quality is compromised by something that is distorting and obscuring the view.
