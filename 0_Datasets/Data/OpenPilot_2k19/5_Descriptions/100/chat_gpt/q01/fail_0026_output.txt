The image appears to be taken through a windshield at night with some visual artifacts typical of shooting in low-light conditions. Nonetheless, there are no signs of the camera being obstructed, covered, or damaged by mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products. What's present could be due to internal reflections within the camera lens, flare from the vehicle lights, low image quality, or a dirty windshield that causes light to scatter or refract, but these do not suggest damage or obstruction to the camera itself.
