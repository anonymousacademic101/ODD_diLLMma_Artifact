The image shows a clear view of a road intersection with a vehicle off to the side, traffic lights in clear view, and no noticeable distortions or markings that would suggest the camera lens was compromised. There appears to be a small amount of residue or reflection at the bottom of the image, but it does not materially obstruct or cover the camera's view in a way that would significantly impact the image quality."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
