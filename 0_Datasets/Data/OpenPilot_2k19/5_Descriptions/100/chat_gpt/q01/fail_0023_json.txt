Instead, the blurriness and poor image quality appear to be due to other factors, possibly related to low lighting conditions, motion blur from either the camera or the cars being in motion, or possibly due to a low-quality camera sensor or lens. It does not seem that the camera itself was covered with any of the mentioned substances at the time this photo was taken.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
