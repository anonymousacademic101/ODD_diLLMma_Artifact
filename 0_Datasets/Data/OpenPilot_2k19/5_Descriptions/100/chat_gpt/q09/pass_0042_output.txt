NO

The image appears to show a nighttime scene with a road that seems fairly level and straight within the range of the headlights. There's nothing clearly indicating that the road is hilly from what can be seen in this image. It's possible that there are hills beyond the illuminated area, but based on the visible evidence, the road does not appear to be hilly.
