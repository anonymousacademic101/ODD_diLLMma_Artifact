NO.

The road you are driving on appears relatively flat and straight without any significant inclinations or declines, which would be indicative of hilly terrain. The visible horizon line is steady and the vehicles ahead don't show any angle consistent with a hilly road. Additionally, the surrounding terrain beside the highway, while having some elevation, does not seem to affect the flatness of the road itself.
