NO

Based on the image provided, it is difficult to conclusively determine whether the road is hilly due to the darkness and limited visibility. The available visual information shows a relatively flat horizon with no obvious inclines or declines, and the path of the headlights suggests a level surface. There are no visible undulations that would typically indicate a hilly terrain. However, without a wider view or additional context, it is impossible to guarantee that there aren't any hills beyond the scope of the image.
