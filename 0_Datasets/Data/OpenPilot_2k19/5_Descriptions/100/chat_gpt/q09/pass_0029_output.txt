NO

The road in the image appears to be relatively flat. There are no visible inclines or declines that would indicate the presence of hills. The lighting is limited, and it's a night scene, but the horizon line is straight and no significant elevation changes can be observed in the trajectory of the road or the positioning of the headlights of the vehicles ahead.
