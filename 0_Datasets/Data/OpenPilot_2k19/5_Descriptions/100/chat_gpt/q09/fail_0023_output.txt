From the provided image, it's not possible to definitively tell whether the road is hilly, as the angle and quality of the image do not offer enough information about the elevation changes in the road ahead. The view is obstructed by other vehicles, and the distance view is quite dark, which doesn't allow for a clear assessment of the road's topography.
