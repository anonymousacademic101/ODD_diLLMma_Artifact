NO.

The image is taken from inside a vehicle at night and shows a gas station, other vehicles, and street lighting. Due to the nighttime setting and the glare from lights, the road's elevation changes cannot be clearly determined. However, there's no clear indication of significant elevation changes like hills visible in the picture; the road appears relatively flat from the visible section. Additionally, the headlight reflections on the ground do not suggest any immediate steep inclines or declines you would expect on a hilly road.
