NO

Based on the image provided, the road appears to be relatively flat immediately around the vehicle's location. There are no visible steep inclines or declines that would suggest the road is hilly right where the picture is taken. The horizon line seems level, and the traffic lights and signs are upright, which further indicates a flat terrain. However, without being able to see more of the road in the distance, it's not possible to conclusively say whether the road becomes hilly further on.
