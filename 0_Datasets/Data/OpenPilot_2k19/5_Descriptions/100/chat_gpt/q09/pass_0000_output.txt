NO

Based on the image provided, it is not possible to definitively state whether the road is hilly due to the lack of visual information about elevation changes. The road appears relatively flat in the visible section, but the image does not provide enough context to assess the terrain beyond the immediate field of view. The headlights illuminate only a short stretch of the roadway, and the overall darkness and limited visibility prevent a conclusive determination about the presence of hills.
