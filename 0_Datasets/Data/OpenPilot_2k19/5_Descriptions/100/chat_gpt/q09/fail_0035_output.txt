NO.

The road shown in the image appears to be relatively flat and does not exhibit any clear signs of hills or inclines. A hilly road would typically show elevation changes or sloping terrain, which are not present in this view. The horizon appears level and the vehicles on the road are not oriented at an angle that would suggest they are driving up or down a hill.
