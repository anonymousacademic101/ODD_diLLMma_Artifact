YES

The road ahead appears to have a slight incline, indicating that this section of the highway might be on a hill. However, without more context or a wider view of the terrain, it's not possible to determine if the entire area is hilly or if this is just a small rise in an otherwise flat region. The term "hilly" suggests a series of hills and this image doesn't provide enough evidence to confidently describe the overall road as being in a hilly area, but the immediate road we're on is indeed sloping upwards.
