The street is visible for a fair distance, and the consistent level of the headlights of other vehicles, as well as the position of streetlights and traffic signals, indicate that there are no visible inclines or declines that would suggest the presence of hills. The horizontal lines of the pedestrian crosswalk also suggest a level surface.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
