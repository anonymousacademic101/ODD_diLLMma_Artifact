The image shows a stretch of road during nighttime that appears to be relatively flat. There are no visible inclines or declines that would suggest the presence of hills on this section of the road. The horizon line is consistent, and the headlights of the car illuminate the road ahead evenly, which often wouldn't be the case if the road were hilly.
