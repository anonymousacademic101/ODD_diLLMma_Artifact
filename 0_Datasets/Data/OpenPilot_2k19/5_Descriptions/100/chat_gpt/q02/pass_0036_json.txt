The lanes are clearly marked and run parallel to each other without any indication of a sharp curve. The traffic ahead also seems to follow a straight path, which typically would not be the case if there were a sharp bend. Sharp curves typically necessitate clear warning signs and reduced speed limits, neither of which are apparent in the view provided.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
