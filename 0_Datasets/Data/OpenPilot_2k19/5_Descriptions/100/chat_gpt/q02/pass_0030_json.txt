There is a slight bend visible far ahead, but it does not appear to be sharp based on the angle and the visible stretch of the road. Sharp curves typically involve a more acute change in direction that would be evident in the immediate lane markings or road alignment, which is not observed here.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
