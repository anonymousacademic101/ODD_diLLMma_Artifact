The photo appears to show a vehicle that is either entering a parking lot or at an intersection, rather than driving on a sharp curve in the road. The presence of other vehicles and the parking spots in the background suggest that this is more likely a parking area or road within a commercial area, not a curved section of a high-speed roadway.
