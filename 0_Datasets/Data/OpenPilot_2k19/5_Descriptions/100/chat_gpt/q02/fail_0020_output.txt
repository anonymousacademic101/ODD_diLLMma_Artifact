NO

The road ahead does not appear to make a sharp curve; instead, it looks like it leads straight into an intersection with traffic lights indicating the flow of traffic. There is a crosswalk directly in front, and the road continues straight on the other side of the intersection. Sharp curves in roads typically feature warning signs and a visible bend in the road, which are not present in this image.
