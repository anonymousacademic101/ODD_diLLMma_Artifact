The image does not show a sharp curve in the road; instead, it depicts an intersection at night with vehicles stopped at a traffic signal. Visible are lane markings for a left turn, straight lanes, and a stop line. The road ahead appears to lead straight on from the intersection, without any sharp curve visible in the immediate foreground.
