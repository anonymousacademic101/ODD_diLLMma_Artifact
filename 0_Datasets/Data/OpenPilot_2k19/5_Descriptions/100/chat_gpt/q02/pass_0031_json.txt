Sharp curves typically require significant steering adjustments and often have warning signs posted, which are not evident in this image. The lane markings continue straight ahead, and the guardrail on the left also extends straight, suggesting that the curvature of the road is gentle rather than sharp.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
