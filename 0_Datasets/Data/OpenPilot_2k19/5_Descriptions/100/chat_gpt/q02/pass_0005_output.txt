The road shown in the image appears to be relatively straight with a gentle curve to the left in the distance. There are no signs of a sharp curve in the immediate view of the road ahead. Sharp curves are typically characterized by a rapid change in direction which necessitates significant steering adjustments, and this does not seem to be the case here.
