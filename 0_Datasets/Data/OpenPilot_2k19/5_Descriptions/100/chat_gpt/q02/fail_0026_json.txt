While there is a slight bend to the right indicated by the alignment of the vehicle lights and the visible road markings, it is not depicted as a sharp curve. Sharp curves in the road would be indicated by a more acute angle in the direction of the road or warning signs indicating such a curve, which are not visible in this image. It appears to be more of a slight bend or a turn in the road rather than a sharp curve.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
