NO

The road ahead does not appear to feature a sharp curve. Instead, it seems to make a gentle bend to the left as indicated by the visible lane lines and the orientation of vehicles ahead. Sharp curves generally have warning signs and a more pronounced change in direction, neither of which is visible in this image.
