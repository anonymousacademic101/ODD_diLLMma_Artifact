NO

The road ahead, as visible in the image, is not showing a sharp curve. It appears to be a slight bend to the right but not sharp enough to be characterized as a sharp curve. Sharp curves typically require significant steering adjustment and often have warning signs indicating their presence due to the increased risk they pose; the curve in this image appears to be gentle with no such additional signage visible.
