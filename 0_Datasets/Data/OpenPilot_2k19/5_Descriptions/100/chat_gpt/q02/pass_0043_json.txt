The bend is shallow enough that the lanes remain visible for some distance, and there isn't a sharp turn that would occlude the driver's line of sight significantly. Sharp curves generally require more caution and significant changes in steering, which does not seem to be necessary in this scenario based on the visible road."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
