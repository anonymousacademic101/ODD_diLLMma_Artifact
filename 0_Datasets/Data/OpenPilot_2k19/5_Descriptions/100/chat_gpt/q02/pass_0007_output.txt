The road is not on a sharp curve. The image appears to show a vehicle queuing in a drive-thru lane of a restaurant, which is marked by painted arrows indicating the path to follow. The bend visible in the queue path is gentle and is typical for drive-thru lanes to direct vehicles around the order and pick-up windows. Sharp curves are usually associated with roads or highways with more severe changes in direction.
