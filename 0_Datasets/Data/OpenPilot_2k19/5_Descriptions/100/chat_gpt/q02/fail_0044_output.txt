NO

The road shown in the image is not a sharp curve. The photograph depicts a road leading straight towards a traffic light intersection. The road in the immediate foreground may curve slightly to the right, but it is not so sharp as to be characterized as a sharp curve. Sharp curves are typically indicated by road signs and involve a significant bend in the road, which is not visible in this image.
