Sharp curves typically require significant steering adjustment and often have warning signs indicating their presence due to the increased risk they pose; the curve in this image appears to be gentle with no such additional signage visible.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
