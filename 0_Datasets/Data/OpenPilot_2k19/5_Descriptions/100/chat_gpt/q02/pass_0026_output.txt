NO.

The road ahead appears to gradually curve to the right rather than being a sharp curve. The highway lanes are visible in a long stretch, and traffic is smoothly navigating the road. A sharp curve would typically mean an immediate and significant change in the direction of the road, often accompanied by warning signs indicating a sharp turn. While there is a warning sign visible indicating a curve ahead, the curvature of the road doesn't seem to be sharp from this perspective.
