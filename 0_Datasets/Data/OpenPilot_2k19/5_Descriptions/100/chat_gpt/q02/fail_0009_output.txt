YES

While a direct assessment of the curve's sharpness is somewhat obscured due to the motion blur and glare from the lights in the image, there are indications that support this: the angle of the vehicle in relation to the stationary objects (like the gas station on the right), and the visible curvature of the reflective lane markings suggest that the road is indeed taking a sharp turn. Additionally, the car headlights in the distance appear to follow a curved trajectory, which further implies a sharp curve in the road ahead.
