NO

The image provided shows a view from a vehicle approaching what appears to be an intersection rather than a sharp curve. The road markings and signage visible do not indicate a sharp curve. Instead, they suggest a straight pathway and possibly a turn is regulated by traffic signals ahead. The shape of the road and the surroundings do not suggest an immediate sharp curve in the path of the vehicle.
