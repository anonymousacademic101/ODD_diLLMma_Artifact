NO.

The image shows a road that appears to be straight right at the point where the car is located, with a visible intersection ahead. The traffic lights are directly in front of the vehicle, and the road markings for a pedestrian crosswalk are also straight, indicating that the road continues in a straight direction from this point. There is no evidence in the image of a sharp curve immediately ahead on the road we are "driving" on.
