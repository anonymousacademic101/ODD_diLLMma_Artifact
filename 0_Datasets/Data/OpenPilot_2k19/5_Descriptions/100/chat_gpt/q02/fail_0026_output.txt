NO.

The image shows a line of cars, presumably waiting at a traffic signal based on the red lights visible through the windshield of the car in front and the traffic light seen to the right. While there is a slight bend to the right indicated by the alignment of the vehicle lights and the visible road markings, it is not depicted as a sharp curve. Sharp curves in the road would be indicated by a more acute angle in the direction of the road or warning signs indicating such a curve, which are not visible in this image. It appears to be more of a slight bend or a turn in the road rather than a sharp curve.
