The image shows a vehicle driving through what appears to be a drive-thru lane adjacent to a building. The path the vehicle is on is not a road but a lane designed for vehicles to wait in line to pick up orders from a service window. It is not showing a sharp curve on a road but rather a slight bend typically found in such service lanes.
