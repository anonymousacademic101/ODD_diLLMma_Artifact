The road ahead appears to veer slightly right, but it does not constitute a sharp curve based on the visible trajectory. It looks more like a gentle curve or a minor bend. The lanes seem to remain well-defined and the traffic flow is orderly, which implies that the curvature of the road is not significant enough to be considered "sharp."
