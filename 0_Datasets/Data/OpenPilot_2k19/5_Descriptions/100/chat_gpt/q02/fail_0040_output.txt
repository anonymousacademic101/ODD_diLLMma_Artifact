NO

The road ahead does not appear to be on a sharp curve. While there is a bend to the right visible, the curve does not seem to be particularly tight or sharp, based on the available field of view and the visible road markings. The lane lines are gently curving, suggesting a moderate bend rather than a sharp curve.
