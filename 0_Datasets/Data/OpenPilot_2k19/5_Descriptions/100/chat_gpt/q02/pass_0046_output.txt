YES

The image shows a road curving to the right. The curvature of the road barrier and the lane markings indicate that the road is on a curve, though not necessarily a very sharp one; however, without a wider perspective or more context, it's difficult to determine just how sharp the curve might be. The term "sharp curve" is somewhat subjective, but based on the visible information and the alignment of the cars, it's reasonable to conclude that there is a noticeable curve in the road ahead.
