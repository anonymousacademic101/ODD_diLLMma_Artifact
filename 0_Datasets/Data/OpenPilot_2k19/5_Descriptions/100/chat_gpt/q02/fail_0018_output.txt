The road shown in the image appears to have a curve, but based on what can be seen, it does not look like a "sharp" curve. The turn seems gentle, and the roadway markings indicate a smoother turn rather than a sharp one. Sharp curves typically have more abrupt changes in direction, often accompanied by warning signs and arrows indicating the sharpness of the turn, which are not visible in this image.
