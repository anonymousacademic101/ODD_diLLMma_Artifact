NO.

The image shows a multi-lane highway with cars moving in a straight direction, following parallel lane markings that indicate no immediate sharp turns. There is a slight bend visible far ahead, but it does not appear to be sharp based on the angle and the visible stretch of the road. Sharp curves typically involve a more acute change in direction that would be evident in the immediate lane markings or road alignment, which is not observed here.
