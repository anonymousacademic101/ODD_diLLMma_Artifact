NO.

The road ahead does not appear to be on a sharp curve based on the image provided. It seems to be rather straight with a slight bend to the right in the distance, beyond the crosswalk and the intersection. Sharp curves in roads are typically indicated by more dramatic changes in the direction of the road, often accompanied by warning signs, none of which are visible in this image.
