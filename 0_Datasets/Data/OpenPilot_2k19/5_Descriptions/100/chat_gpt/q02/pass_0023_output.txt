NO

The road does not appear to be on a sharp curve. The visible lane markings and the orientation of the vehicles suggest that the road is relatively straight at this section, with only a gentle curve, if at all. The road ahead can be seen continuing in the same direction without any sharp turns. Additionally, the road signs do not indicate a sharp curve ahead.
