NO

The road ahead appears to be quite straight with only a gentle curve visible in the distance. The lanes are clearly marked and run parallel to each other without any indication of a sharp curve. The traffic ahead also seems to follow a straight path, which typically would not be the case if there were a sharp bend. Sharp curves typically necessitate clear warning signs and reduced speed limits, neither of which are apparent in the view provided.
