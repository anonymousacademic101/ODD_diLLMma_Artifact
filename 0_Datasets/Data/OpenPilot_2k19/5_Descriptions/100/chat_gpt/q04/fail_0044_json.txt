This can be determined by several indicators: there are traffic lights in various directions, crosswalk lines are visible, and there are turning lanes suggesting the presence of crossing or joining roads. Additionally, we can see pedestrian signals and a sidewalk curb cut, indicating pedestrian crossing points which typically align with intersection layouts. The road also extends past the traffic light, which further points to an intersection rather than a road running horizontally across the image.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
