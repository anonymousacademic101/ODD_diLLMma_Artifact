The road does not run horizontally across the image; rather, it extends into the distance from the bottom to the top of the image. The perspective indicated by the lane markings suggests that we are viewing a road that stretches straight ahead, with no visible intersection in this particular frame. The road is receding into the distance, which creates a vanishing point towards the top of the image, indicating depth and the direction of the road.
