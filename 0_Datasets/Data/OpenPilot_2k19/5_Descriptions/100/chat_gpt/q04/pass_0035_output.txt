NO.

The road does not run horizontally across the image. The perspective of the photo shows the road extending into the distance, which gives the impression of a vanishing point. This perspective is consistent with driving along a road rather than observing it from the side. If the road ran horizontally across the image, it would appear more as a band of road stretching from one side to the other, rather than converging in the distance.
