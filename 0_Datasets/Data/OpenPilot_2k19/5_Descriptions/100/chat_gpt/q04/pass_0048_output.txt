YES

We are driving on an intersection. This can be inferred due to the presence of multiple traffic signal lights governing different flows of traffic, pedestrian crossing markings on the road, and a visible crossroad in the distance where the street lights are aligned perpendicularly to the direction we are facing, indicating the crossing paths of different roadways.
