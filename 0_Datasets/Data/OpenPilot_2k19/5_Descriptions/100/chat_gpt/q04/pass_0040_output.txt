NO.

The image provided does not show the road we are driving on as an intersection or as running horizontally across the image. Instead, the image shows a parking lot with several parked cars, and the view is from within a vehicle that is presumably parked or driving through the lot. An intersection typically involves roads crossing each other, and a horizontal road across an image would suggest a view along the road's length from a perpendicular perspective. The view in this image does not correspond to either of those descriptions.
