NO.

The road does not appear to be an intersection nor does it run horizontally across the image. It seems to be a multi-lane highway or freeway, with the lanes running parallel into the depth of the image, from the bottom where the viewer is positioned towards the top where the road continues into the distance. The vehicles are aligned in this direction, indicating the flow of traffic along the length of the road.
