The road does not run horizontally across the image; rather, it appears that the vehicle from which the image was taken is approaching a corner or turn in the parking lot, as indicated by the curbed area with the yellow painted section and the directional arrow on the pavement suggesting a right-hand turn. There's no evident intersection present from this perspective.
