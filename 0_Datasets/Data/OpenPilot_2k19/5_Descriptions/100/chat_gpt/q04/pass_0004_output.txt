The road does not appear to be an intersection. It runs horizontally across the image, as we can see multiple lanes of traffic moving parallel in the same direction, which is characteristic of a highway or a multi-lane road, rather than an intersection. The continuous lines and the flow of traffic suggest that it's a straight stretch of road.
