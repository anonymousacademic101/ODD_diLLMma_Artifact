YES

The road we are driving on appears to be at an intersection. This is indicated by the presence of a stop line and a stop sign painted on the road surface, suggesting that the driver is required to stop and give way to traffic on another road intersecting from the right, which runs horizontally across the image. Additionally, there are vehicles parked parallel to the road on the right side of the image, which also suggests the presence of an intersecting road.
