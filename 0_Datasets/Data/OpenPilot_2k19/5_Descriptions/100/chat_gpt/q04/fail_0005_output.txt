NO.

The road in the image does not appear to be an intersection nor does it run horizontally across the image. Instead, the road seems to run vertically from the bottom towards the top of the image, indicating the perspective of a vehicle going straight on the road. There are no visible traffic signals, crossroads, or other indicators that would suggest this is an intersection. The horizontal road markings suggest lanes or a parking area adjacent to the road the vehicle is on, rather than an intersection.
