NO

From the image provided, it appears that the road is not at an intersection but instead runs horizontally. The lane lines continue straight across the image, and there is a warning traffic sign (appears to be a curve warning or similar) visible on the right-hand side of the road, which typically indicates a continuous stretch of road ahead rather than an intersection. The lack of any visible traffic signals, stop signs, cross traffic, or other indications of an intersection supports this observation.
