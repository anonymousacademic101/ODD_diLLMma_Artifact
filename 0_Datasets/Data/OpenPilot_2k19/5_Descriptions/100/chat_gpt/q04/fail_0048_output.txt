The road in the image appears to be part of an intersection rather than running horizontally across the image. This is indicated by the presence of traffic lights and road markings that suggest multiple directions of travel, as well as the visible cross street where another vehicle is making a turn. The layout of the intersection, visible traffic signals, and lane markings all suggest that multiple roads converge at this point.
