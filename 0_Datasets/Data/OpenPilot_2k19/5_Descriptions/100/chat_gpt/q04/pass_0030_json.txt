We can determine this because the lanes of the highway extend from the lower portion of the image to the horizon, parallel to the bottom edge of the image. The vehicles are traveling parallel to each other in these lanes, suggesting a horizontal direction across the view of the image. An intersection typically entails roads crossing each other at some angle, and there's no indication of such a crossing here. Instead, this is a section of a highway with multiple lanes going in the same direction, which is indicative of a horizontal path across the image."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
