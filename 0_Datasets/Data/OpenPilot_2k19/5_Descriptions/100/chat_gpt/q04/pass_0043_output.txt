The road does not appear to be an intersection; rather, it runs horizontally across the image as indicated by the lane markings that lead straight ahead and the flow of traffic on the road. This is further supported by the continuous guardrails on both sides, suggesting a straight path rather than an intersection, which would typically feature cross traffic and additional roadways converging or diverging from the main road.
