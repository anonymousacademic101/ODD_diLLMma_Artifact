YES.

The road we are driving on is an intersection. There are several indicators in the image that suggest this: 

1. There are traffic signals visible, which are commonly placed at intersections to control vehicular movement.
2. The positioning of the cars on the other side of the intersection indicates they are waiting to proceed through the intersection or to turn.
3. The presence of a crosswalk, which is often found at intersections to facilitate pedestrian crossing.
4. The way the roads seem to intersect, as can be observed from the arrangement of different driving lanes and the orientation of the vehicles.
