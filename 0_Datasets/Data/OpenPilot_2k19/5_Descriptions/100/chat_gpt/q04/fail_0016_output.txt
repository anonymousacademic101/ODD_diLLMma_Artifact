YES

The road viewed through the windshield runs horizontally across the image. The presence of a vehicle directly facing the viewer's direction, with its rear to the other side of the image, indicates that this is likely a two-way road and the vehicle is waiting to proceed or turn, which typically happens at intersections. Additionally, we see another car coming from the right side of the image crossing the path in front of the black car, further suggesting an intersection.
