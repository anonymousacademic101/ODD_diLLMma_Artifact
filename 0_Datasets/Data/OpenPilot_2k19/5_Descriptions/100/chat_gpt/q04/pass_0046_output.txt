The road does not run horizontally across the image; instead, the perspective presented shows the road extending into the distance from the bottom of the image to the horizon, creating a vanishing point towards the center of the image. This suggests we are on a road traveling in a more vertical direction in the plane of the image, rather than a horizontal one. An intersection is typically characterized by two or more roads crossing each other, which is not apparent in this image.
