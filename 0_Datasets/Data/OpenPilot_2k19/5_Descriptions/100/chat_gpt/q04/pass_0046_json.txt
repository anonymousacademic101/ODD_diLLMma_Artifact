This suggests we are on a road traveling in a more vertical direction in the plane of the image, rather than a horizontal one. An intersection is typically characterized by two or more roads crossing each other, which is not apparent in this image.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
