YES

The road runs horizontally across the image. It is evident from the perspective of the lanes, the positioning of the vehicles, and the flow of traffic that we are on a road that stretches from the left to the right side of the picture, which makes it appear horizontal within the frame of the image. There is no clear indication of an intersection within the visible area.
