The road does not run horizontally across the image, and this does not appear to be a conventional intersection. The setting looks like a drive-thru lane for a fast-food restaurant, indicated by the presence of directional arrows on the ground, a restaurant building, and vehicles lined up waiting for service. Drive-thru lanes are typically one-way access paths along the side or around the perimeter of a restaurant.
