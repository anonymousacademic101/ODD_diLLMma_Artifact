The road does not run horizontally across the image; it appears to be a typical straight roadway where vehicles are aligned in the same direction, indicating a linear path rather than an intersection or a road running horizontally across the frame. The image shows a car in front which is on the same road, suggesting that the viewer is also on this road, and it is continuing forward rather than intersecting or crossing horizontally.
