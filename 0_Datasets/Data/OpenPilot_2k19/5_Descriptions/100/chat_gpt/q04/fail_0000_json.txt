The lane lines continue straight across the image, and there is a warning traffic sign (appears to be a curve warning or similar) visible on the right-hand side of the road, which typically indicates a continuous stretch of road ahead rather than an intersection. The lack of any visible traffic signals, stop signs, cross traffic, or other indications of an intersection supports this observation.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
