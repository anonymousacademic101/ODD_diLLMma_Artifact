The image does not depict a road running horizontally across; instead, it appears that we are in a drive-thru lane adjacent to a building, based on the presence of a service window and the layout generally associated with such a setting. The car is positioned with the building on its right and is facing towards the service window, suggesting a path that moves parallel to the building rather than a traditional road intersection or horizontally across the image.
