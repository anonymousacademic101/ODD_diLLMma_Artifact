YES

The image shows a road running horizontally across it from the perspective of the camera. This is indicated by the positioning and orientation of the zebra crossing in the foreground, which is perpendicular to the viewer's line of sight, suggesting that the road continues across the image horizontally. Additionally, the traffic lights and the flow of the vehicles support this orientation of the road running horizontally.
