NO

It appears that we are not driving on a road but are instead situated in a parking lot, which is indicated by the parked cars arranged perpendicular to our viewpoint and the presence of parking space demarcations. The "road" seems to be a driving lane within the parking lot, used for moving between parking spaces, not an intersection or a road running horizontally across the image.
