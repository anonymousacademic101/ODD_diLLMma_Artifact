The road does not run horizontally across the image. It appears that the vehicle from which the photo is taken is facing an intersection where the road continues forward and there is an option to turn right. The orientation of the parked cars, the position of the yellow traffic sign, and the layout of the curbs indicate that the image captures a T-shaped intersection rather than a stretch of road running from left to right across the frame.
