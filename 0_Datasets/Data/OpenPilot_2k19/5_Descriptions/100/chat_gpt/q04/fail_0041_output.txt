YES

The road we are driving on is an intersection. There are multiple indications of this: the presence of traffic lights, road markings that designate turning lanes, and a crosswalk, all of which are characteristic of an intersection. Additionally, there is a side road visible to the right in the image, confirming that the main road intersects with another.
