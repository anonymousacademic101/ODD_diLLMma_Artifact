We know this because the photo shows a straight stretch of road from the driver's perspective, with lane markings running parallel to the bottom of the frame, which indicates a horizontal direction relative to the image's orientation. There are also multiple lanes of traffic with vehicles positioned side by side, suggesting a multi-lane roadway rather than an intersection. Additionally, the continuous flow of traffic in one direction implies that it is a standard roadway rather than an intersection, where traffic would be crossing paths or turning."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
