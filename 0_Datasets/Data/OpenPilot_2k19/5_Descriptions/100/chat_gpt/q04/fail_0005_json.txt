Instead, the road seems to run vertically from the bottom towards the top of the image, indicating the perspective of a vehicle going straight on the road. There are no visible traffic signals, crossroads, or other indicators that would suggest this is an intersection. The horizontal road markings suggest lanes or a parking area adjacent to the road the vehicle is on, rather than an intersection.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
