The road does not run horizontally across the image. It appears we are on a highway driving toward an overpass or underpass, where the overpass crosses above the road we are on perpendicularly. The signs for directions to San Jose and Pacifica suggest exits on the highway, indicating that this is likely a section of a highway system rather than a simple intersection. The road itself extends into the distance with lane markings leading straight forward, suggesting a horizontal trajectory in the image's perspective.
