The road that we are driving on does indeed appear to be an intersection. The presence of road markings indicating turning lanes, such as arrows suggesting a right-hand turn and a straight option, typically signal an intersection rather than a road running horizontally across the image. These markings generally guide drivers on how to navigate intersections and the options available to them: turning or continuing straight.
