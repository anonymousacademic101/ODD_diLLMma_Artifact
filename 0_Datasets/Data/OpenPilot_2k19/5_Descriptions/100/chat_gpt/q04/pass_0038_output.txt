The road shown in the image runs horizontally across the image. An intersection would typically show multiple converging roadways allowing traffic to cross or turn, which is not seen here. Instead, the lanes of traffic proceed parallel to the bottom edge of the image, indicating a horizontal orientation rather than an intersection.
