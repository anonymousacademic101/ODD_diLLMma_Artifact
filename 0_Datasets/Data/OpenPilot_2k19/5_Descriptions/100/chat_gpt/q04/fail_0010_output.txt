YES

The road we are driving on is part of an intersection. This can be determined by the traffic signals, the presence of crossing lanes of traffic, and line markings on the road that indicate turning lanes and crossings for pedestrians, which are typical characteristics of an intersection. Additionally, there's a red light visible in the image, which suggests that the vehicle from which the photo was taken is required to stop, reinforcing that this is an intersection.
