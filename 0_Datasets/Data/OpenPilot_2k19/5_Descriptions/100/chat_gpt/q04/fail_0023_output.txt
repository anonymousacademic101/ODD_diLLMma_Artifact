NO

The image does not clearly show an intersection as we might expect with distinct crossing roads or traffic lights/signs directly relevant to multiple intersecting paths. The road seems to run horizontally across the image, with vehicles oriented parallel to the image's bottom edge, suggesting linear movement rather than the crossing or joining of two separate roads.
