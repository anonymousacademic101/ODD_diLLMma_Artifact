YES

The road we are driving on runs horizontally across the image. This can be inferred from the positioning of the vehicles and the orientation of the traffic lights and road signs, which are parallel to the direction in which the road extends from left to right across the photograph. The intersection is likely perpendicular to our current path since there are crosswalk lines, traffic signals indicating different flows of traffic, and another road visible under the overpass, suggesting traffic crosses at this point.
