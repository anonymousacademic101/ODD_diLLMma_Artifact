This can be determined because the road stretches from the left to the right side of the image without any apparent intersection in the visible area. The lanes are parallel, and there is a clear demarcation of the lanes going in the same direction, indicating that this is a section of road rather than an intersection. The overhead sign also suggests a highway or freeway environment, which typically features long stretches of road without intersections.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
