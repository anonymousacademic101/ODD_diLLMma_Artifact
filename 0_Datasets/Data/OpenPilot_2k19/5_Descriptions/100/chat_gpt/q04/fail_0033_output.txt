YES

The road we are driving on is part of an intersection. You can tell because there are traffic lights and signal directions for turns, indicating crossing traffic paths where drivers must yield or stop for signals, hence creating an intersection of roads. Additionally, the road markings with left turn arrows suggest the presence of an intersection where turns are regulated. The road also appears to run horizontally across the image as the perspective is from a driver's vantage point facing forward, creating a horizontal representation in the image.
