NO.

The road runs horizontally across the image. This can be determined by the perspective in the photo where the lanes of the road stretch from the bottom to the horizon in a horizontal fashion, consistent with how roads appear when being driven on. There are also directional road signs perpendicular to the direction of traffic, which suggests it is not an intersection.
