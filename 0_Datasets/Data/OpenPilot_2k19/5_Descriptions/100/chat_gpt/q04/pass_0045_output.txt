The road we are driving on does not appear to be an intersection. It runs horizontally across the image, which suggests it is a straight stretch of road rather than one where roads cross each other. An intersection usually has multiple roadways that cross or meet each other at different angles, and there tend to be traffic control devices like stop signs, traffic signals, or road markings indicating crossing traffic, which are not evident in this image.
