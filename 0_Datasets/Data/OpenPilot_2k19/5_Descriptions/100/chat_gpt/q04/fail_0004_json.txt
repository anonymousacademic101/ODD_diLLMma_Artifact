The vehicles are aligned parallel to the bottom edge of the image, suggesting that the road they are on runs horizontally from this perspective. Traffic signals facing sideways indicate that the direction of traffic flow is perpendicular to the viewer's line of sight. The intersection itself, where the roads cross, is perpendicular to the road we are on, but this is not what is being asked."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
