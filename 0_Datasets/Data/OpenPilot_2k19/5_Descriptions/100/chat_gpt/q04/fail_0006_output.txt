YES

The road runs horizontally across the image. You can tell because the lanes of traffic both on the side of the viewer and across the median are aligned parallel to the bottom edge of the image, indicating a horizontal orientation of the road. There are also vehicles visible in the image that are parked or moving in a direction that aligns with this horizontal orientation, further confirming that the road runs horizontally and not at an intersection in the perspective of the image.
