NO.

The road in the image does not run horizontally across the image; rather, it appears to be a part of an intersection. You can deduce this from the visible curb and pavement outline, which suggests that another road intersects perpendicularly with the road we're on. The road we're on seems to approach this junction from a slight angle, resulting in a view that partially shows the intersecting street ahead.
