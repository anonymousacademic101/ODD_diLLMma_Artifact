NO.

The road does not run horizontally across the image. The perspective of the photo, with the direction of the parking space lines visible from the driver's viewpoint, suggests that the vehicle is facing directly towards a building, indicating that the road (or parking lot aisle) is perpendicular to the bottom edge of the photo. The road is not an intersection within the frame of this image but rather leads directly towards or away from the building.
