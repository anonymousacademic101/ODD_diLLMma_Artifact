NO

The road appears to run horizontally across the image. This is indicated by the positioning of the parked cars on the side of the road; they are parallel to the direction of the road, suggesting a typical street view rather than an intersection. Furthermore, no visible traffic signals, road markings, or signs typical of an intersection are evident in the image, reinforcing the interpretation that this is a straight segment of roadway.
