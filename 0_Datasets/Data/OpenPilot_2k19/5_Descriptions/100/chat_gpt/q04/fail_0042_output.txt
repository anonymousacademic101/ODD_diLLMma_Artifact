YES

The road runs horizontally across the image. We can tell because the lanes of the road are parallel to the bottom edge of the image, indicating the perspective is such that we are viewing the road as it extends from left to right across the frame, representing a horizontal orientation in relation to the image itself. Additionally, the vehicles are arranged in a way that suggests they are traveling along the road's horizontal path, further confirming this orientation.
