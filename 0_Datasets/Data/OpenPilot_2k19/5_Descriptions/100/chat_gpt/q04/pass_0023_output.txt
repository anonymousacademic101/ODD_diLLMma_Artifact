NO.

The road in the image runs horizontally across the image. It appears to be a multi-lane freeway or highway with traffic flowing in the same direction, which indicates it is not an intersection. Additionally, there are no visible traffic signals, cross streets, or other indications of an intersection. Traffic lanes and road markings suggest a continuous flow of traffic rather than a crossing point.
