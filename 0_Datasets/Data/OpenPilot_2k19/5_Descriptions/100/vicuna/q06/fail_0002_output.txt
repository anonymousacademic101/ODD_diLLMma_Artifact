Yes, there is construction on the road we are driving on.

The image shows a parking lot with a car parked in front of a building. The building has a white exterior with large windows and a sign that reads "McDonald's." There are several other cars parked in the lot, and the road in front of the building appears to be under construction with orange cones and barriers blocking off part of the road.
