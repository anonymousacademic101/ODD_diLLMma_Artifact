Yes, there is construction on the road we are driving on.

The image shows a car driving on a road with construction on both sides of the road. The construction on the left side of the road appears to be a building under construction, while the construction on the right side of the road appears to be a road repair project. The car is driving towards the camera, and there are other cars parked on the side of the road.
