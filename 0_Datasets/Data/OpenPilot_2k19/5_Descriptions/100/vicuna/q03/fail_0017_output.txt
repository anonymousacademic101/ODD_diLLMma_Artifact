Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving on a road that appears to be an on-off ramp. The road has a concrete barrier in the middle and there are cars driving on it in both directions. The road seems to be elevated and there is a bridge in the background.
