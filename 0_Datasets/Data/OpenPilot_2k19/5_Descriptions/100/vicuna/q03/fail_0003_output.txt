Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving on a road that appears to be an on-off ramp. The car is parked on the right side of the road, and there is a curb on the left side of the road. The building in the background appears to be a store or restaurant, and there is a parking lot in front of it. The road appears to be a one-way street, as there are arrows pointing in the same direction on the road.
