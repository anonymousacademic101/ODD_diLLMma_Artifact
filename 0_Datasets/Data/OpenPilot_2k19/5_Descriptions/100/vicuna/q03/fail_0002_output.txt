Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The on-off ramp is a road that allows vehicles to enter or exit a controlled-access highway, such as a freeway or motorway. It is typically located at interchanges, where two or more highways meet. On-off ramps are designed to provide a smooth and safe transition for vehicles entering or exiting the highway, and they often include features such as acceleration and deceleration lanes, as well as traffic signals or signs to guide drivers.
