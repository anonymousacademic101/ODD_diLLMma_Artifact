Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The on-off ramp is a type of interchange that allows vehicles to enter or exit a controlled-access highway, such as a freeway or expressway. The on-off ramp is typically located at the end of a controlled-access highway, where it intersects with a local road or street. The on-off ramp is designed to allow vehicles to enter or exit the highway safely and efficiently, without disrupting the flow of traffic on the highway.

The on-off ramp typically consists of two lanes: one for vehicles entering the highway, and one for vehicles exiting the highway. The lanes are separated by a median, which helps to prevent head-on collisions between vehicles entering and exiting the highway. The on-off ramp also typically includes traffic signals or signs to help regulate the flow of traffic and ensure that vehicles enter and exit the highway in a safe and orderly manner.

Overall, the on-off ramp is an important feature of controlled-access highways, as it allows vehicles to safely enter and exit the highway while minimizing disruptions to the flow of traffic.
