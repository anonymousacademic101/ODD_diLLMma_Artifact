Based on this image, it is clear that the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp. The yellow line down the middle of the road and the curve in the road indicate that it is a divided road, and the trees on either side of the road suggest that it is a rural area. Additionally, the fact that the road appears to be going uphill suggests that it is an on-ramp, as on-ramps typically lead to higher elevations than off-ramps.
