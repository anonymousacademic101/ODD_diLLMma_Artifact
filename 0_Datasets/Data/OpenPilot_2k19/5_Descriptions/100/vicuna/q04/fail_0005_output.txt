Yes, the road we are driving on is an intersection.

The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down a road. The road appears to be an intersection, as there are other roads intersecting with the one the car is on. The buildings on either side of the road appear to be commercial or industrial in nature, with large windows and metal roofs. The sky is overcast, and there are no other vehicles visible in the image.
