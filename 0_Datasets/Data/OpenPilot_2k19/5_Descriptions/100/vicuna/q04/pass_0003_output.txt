Yes, the road in the image runs horizontally across the image.

The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down a city street at night. The street is lined with trees on both sides and there are streetlights on the side of the road. The car's headlights illuminate the road ahead, and the taillights illuminate the road behind. There are other cars on the road, driving in the same direction as the car in the image, and their headlights and taillights can be seen in the distance. The image was taken at night, so the sky is dark, and there are no visible stars or the moon.
