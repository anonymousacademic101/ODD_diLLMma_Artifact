This is a photograph of a city street at night, taken from the perspective of a car driving down the road. The street is lined with trees on both sides, and there are streetlights illuminating the area. The road has two lanes, one for traffic heading in each direction. There are no pedestrians visible in the image. The time of day is night, as the sky is dark and there are no visible sunlight or shadows. The image was taken from the driver's perspective, looking out the front windshield of the car.
