This image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car parked outside a building. The building appears to be a commercial establishment, with a sign above the entrance indicating that it is a pharmacy. The car is parked at the curb in front of the building, and there is a fire hydrant next to it. There are no other cars visible in the image, but there are several pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The time of day appears to be morning, as there is still some darkness in the sky, but the sun is beginning to rise. The image was likely taken from the driver's seat of the car, looking out through the front windshield.
