This is a view from the driver's seat of a car traveling down a highway. The road is straight and there are trees on both sides of the highway. The sky is cloudy and there is fog in the distance. There are no other cars on the road, but there are some pedestrians walking on the sidewalk next to the highway. The time of day appears to be morning, as the sun is just starting to rise in the distance. There are no road signs visible in this image.
