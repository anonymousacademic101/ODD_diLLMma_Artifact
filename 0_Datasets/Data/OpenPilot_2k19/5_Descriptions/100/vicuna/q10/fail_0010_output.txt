This image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car traveling down a city street at night. The street is lined with streetlights and trees, and there are buildings on either side of the road. The car's headlights illuminate the road ahead, and the taillights illuminate the road behind. There are other cars on the road, some of which are traveling in the same direction as the car, and some of which are traveling in the opposite direction. There are also pedestrians on the sidewalk, some of whom are walking in the same direction as the car, and some of whom are walking in the opposite direction. The time of day is night, and the lighting is provided by the streetlights and the car's headlights. The driver needs to pay attention to the road, the traffic, and the pedestrians while driving.
