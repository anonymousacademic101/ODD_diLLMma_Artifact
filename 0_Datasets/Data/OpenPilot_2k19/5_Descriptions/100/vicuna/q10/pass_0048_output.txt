This image shows a city street at night, with streetlights and traffic lights illuminating the road. The road appears to be straight and wide, with multiple lanes for traffic. There are no visible pedestrians in the image, but there may be some present in the real-life scene. The time of day appears to be night, as the sky is dark and there are no visible sunlight sources. The image is taken from a driver's perspective, looking out onto the street through the windshield of a car.
