The image is taken during the day. The road appears to be a 3 or 4 lane highway. The road has concrete barriers to the right, and a mix of concrete and metal barriers to the left. The road appears to go over a small bridge based on the concrete barriers which have railings common on bridges. To the left is a small embankment with trees and shrubs. To the right are trees.
