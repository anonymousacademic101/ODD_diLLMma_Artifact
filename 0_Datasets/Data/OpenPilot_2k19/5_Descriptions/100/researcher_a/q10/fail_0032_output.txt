The car is driving during the day, and is in an intersection as the road forks to the left or right. To the left seems to be a parking lot, and to the right it's difficult to tell. However we can see the back of a stop sign, and the work stop painted in white at the entrance of this intersection. The car appears to be in a commercial zone due to the shops which can be seen in the distance.
