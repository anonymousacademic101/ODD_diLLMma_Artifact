The car is driving during the day on a 4 lane road, with 2 lanes for each direction separated by a double yellow line. The car is turning right into what looks like a parking lot. The car is currently driving in the wrong direction into oncoming traffic. You can see hills and several buildings off into the distance. The traffic on the road seems to be light with only a few cars off in the distance.
