The car is driven on a 4 lane road. To the right there is a shoulder that is big enough to drive on but is marked as a no driving zone with pain. The road is merging and you can see a yellow diamond sign that indicates this. To the left the road has a concrete barrier. You can see skyrise apartments to the left and houses to the right. THe image was taken during the day and the sky is blue. The markings seem to be in good condition on the road, however there does seem to be some previous fixes to the road.
