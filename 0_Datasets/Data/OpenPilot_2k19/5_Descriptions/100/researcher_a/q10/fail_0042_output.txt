The car is parked on the right hand side of the road during the day. The car can see 3 lanes to the left, each going in the same direction it is parked. Directly in front of the vehicle is a temporary sign that has a towing enforced sticker on it. To the right is the median with trees and what appears to be a leafy bike or pedestrian path, although none are visible. The road to the left has several cars on it, and there is a truck with gardening equipment parked in front of the temporary sign.
