The car is driving during the day and the sky is blue. The car is on a 5 lane highway with a concrete barrier to the left and metal barrier to the right. The traffic seems moderate or light as there are only 5 cars ahead of it. The lane markings are clear. The yellow line is hard to see from the vantage point of the vehicle.
