The image is taken during the day when the sky is blue. The car is driving on a 4 lane highway. The traffic seems to be light as only 4 other cars are visible in the image. To the left is an embankment with green grass or small shrubs. To the right is a barrier to stop vehicles driving off the road. The lane markings are clear, however the yellow line is visible but hard to see from this angle.
