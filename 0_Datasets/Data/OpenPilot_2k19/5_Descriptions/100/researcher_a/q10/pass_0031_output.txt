The car appears to be on a 4 lane highway which is currently a bridge, based on the concrete barrier to the left which has a railing. The lane markings and road condition seem to be okay, but could be better. The traffic is light and we can only see 3 vehicles in the distance. To the right are trees. The image was taken during the day, and while the sky is clear, it must be late afternoon as the light level is not extremely bright.
