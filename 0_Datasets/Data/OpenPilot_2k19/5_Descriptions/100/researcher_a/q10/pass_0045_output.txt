The image was taken during the day. It appears to be overcast. The road is 3 lanes with another 4th lane that appears to be merging away from the main road. To the left is a concrete barrier and to the right is the lane which is separated by 2 solid white lines. Traffic seems moderate with several vehicles in front.
