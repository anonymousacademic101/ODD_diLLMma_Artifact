The car is driving during the day. The image however is ever so slightly blurry. The car is just entering an intersection, and we can see two sets of traffic lights both are green indicating that the car can enter the intersection. The road markings to the left of the vehicle are poor, while there is a solid white line to the right. There is a white sign indicating which lanes can turn on the traffic light to the right. In the distance there appears to be a small town and rolling hills with trees on them.
