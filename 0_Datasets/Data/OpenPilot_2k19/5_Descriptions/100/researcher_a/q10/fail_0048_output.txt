The car is driving during the day. There are many clouds in the sky. The car is in an intersection and is turning left. The camera can see two traffic lights both which have protected green arrows for turning left. The intersection appears to have two roads entering it, one for each direction of traffic. The car can see a road to the left and two roads to the right. In between the fork in the road is trees and what appears to be the roof of a house. The road to the right has two cars waiting to enter the intersection.
