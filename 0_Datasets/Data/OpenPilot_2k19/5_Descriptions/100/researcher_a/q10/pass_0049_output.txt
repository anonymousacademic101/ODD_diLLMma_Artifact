This image was taken during the day. However the image has poor lighting due to the car driving underneath a bridge. The road has clear markings in white with turn left arrows and solid white lines. There are 2 cars on the 4 lane road driving in the lanes marked for going straight or turning right. There are several pillars to the left supporting the bridge.
