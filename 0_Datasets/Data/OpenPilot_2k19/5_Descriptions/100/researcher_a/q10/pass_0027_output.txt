The car is driving on a 4 lane highway. The car is driving during the day with the sky being bright and blue. The traffic is moderate or light, as there are 4 vehicles in front of the car. To the left is a concrete barrier. To the right are trees. You can see a green information sign coming up but it's impossible to see from the current perspective. The lane markings and road seem in good condition.
