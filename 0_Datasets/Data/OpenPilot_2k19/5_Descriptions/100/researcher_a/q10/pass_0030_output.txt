The car is driving on a 5 lane highway. The image is taken during the day. To the left is a concrete barrier, and it's hard to tell what is to the right, as the car is in the second most left lane. There is a lot of traffic, as several cars can be seen. We can see three green informational signs across the road. There does seem to be some reflection on the windscreen from a piece of paper or ticket. The lane markings are otherwise clear, and the road seems in good condition.
