The car is on a 5 lane highway. The image was taken just before sunrise, or just after sunset. We can tell as there is still significant light, however it is starting to get dark and cars have their lights on. The road is moderately busy with several cars in front of it. To the left is an embankment with grass. To the right are trees. The road markings and road condition seem good.
