This is a crowded intersection. The cars in the opposite lane have stopped so as to not block the intersection. Ahead of this vehicle is a black car turning left. The car with the camera also appears to be turning left into a neighborhood. The road forks to the left and right from this vantage point, with trees and hedges in front of the vehicle. A firetruck can also be seen, however its lights are not on, and therefore is not in a rush to get to an emergency.
