The image is taken during the day on a 3 lane road. The traffic is moderate as there are several vehicles which can be seen from the camera. To the right is a gas station that appears empty. To the right is a median with dirt and trees. The lane markings are clear. In the distance appears to be a multistory building. There is a pointy roof indicating church or temple to the left.
