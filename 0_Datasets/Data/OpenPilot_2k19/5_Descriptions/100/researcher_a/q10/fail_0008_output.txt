The car appears to be in an intersection. The traffic lights for the car are green indicating it can go. There are several cars on the right waiting to enter the intersection. Ahead of the vehicle the road turns into a bridge which may indicate the onramp to a highway. In between the fork is a set of trees. There are some large green signs on the on ramp providing further evidence this is a highway.
