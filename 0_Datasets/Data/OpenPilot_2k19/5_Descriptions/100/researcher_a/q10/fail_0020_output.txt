The car appears to be at an intersection with a traffic light that is green. In front of the car is a pedestrian crossing, and what appears to be the entrance to a gated community. There is white sign on the road indicating which side of the medium cars should drive. The car appears to be turning left away from the gated community. There are some cars parked in the distance outside the houses.
