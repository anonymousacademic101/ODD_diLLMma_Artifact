The car is driving in the left most lane of a 4 lane highway. To the left is a concrete barrier. You can see an information sign to the right. There are several vehicles on the road. There are trees to the right. The image was taken during the day, and there are a few clouds in the sky. The road is mostly straight but curves to the right. There does seem to be some glare in the windscreen, where you can see some of the inside of the car being reflected.
