This was taken at night. The image is slightly blurry but everything still seems visible. There are 3 green informational signs to the right. The road is a 5 lane highway that is straight. There is little to no traffic, with only 3 cars in sight. The lights in the distance indicate that there is either traffic, or a city ahead. The car is about to drive under a bridge. To the right is a concrete barrier.
