The image was taken during the day. The lighting suggests it might be overcast, as there isn't a lot of light. The road is a 4 lane road with traffic all going in the same direction. To the left is a median with trees and dirt. There are trees ahead and to the right. There is lots of traffic with many vehicles in front of us. The lane markings and road condition seem good.
