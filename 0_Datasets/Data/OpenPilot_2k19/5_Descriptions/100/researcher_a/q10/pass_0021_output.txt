The car is driving on a straight 3 lane road. All lanes are traveling in the same direction and to the left is the median with trees and dirt, and cars traveling in the other direction. We can see 3 cars ahead of us, indicating that traffic is light. To the right is a sidewalk and more trees. The image was taken during the day and it might be slightly overcast.
