The image was taken during the day but it seems overcast. The car is driving in the left most lane of a 4 lane highway. To the left is an embankment with grass and trees. To the right is a metal barrier. The traffic is light with vehicles only in the distance. Far in the distance is a green informational sign. The road is mostly straight but curves to the left. The lane markings are clear, and the road seemingly in good condition.
