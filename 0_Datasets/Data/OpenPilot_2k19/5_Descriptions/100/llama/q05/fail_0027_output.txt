The image shows a street with a car driving down it at night. There are streetlights on both sides of the road, and the car's headlights are illuminating the road ahead. The sky is dark and cloudy, with some stars visible in the distance. There are no other vehicles or pedestrians visible in the image.

The road appears to be straight and flat, with no obstacles or hazards in sight. There are no signs or markings on the road that indicate any restrictions for buses or bicycles.

Therefore, the answer to the question is NO, the road does not have any restricted lanes for buses or bicycles.</s>
