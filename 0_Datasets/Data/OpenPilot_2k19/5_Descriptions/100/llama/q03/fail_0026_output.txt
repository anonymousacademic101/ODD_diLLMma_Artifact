The image shows a car driving down a dark road at night. There are no other cars or pedestrians visible in the image.

The road appears to be an on-off ramp, as there is a sign on the side of the road indicating that it is an on-off ramp. The sign is not visible in the image, but it is implied by the presence of the road and the sign on the side of the road.

Therefore, the answer to the question is YES, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.</s>
