The image shows a car driving down a road at night. There are streetlights on either side of the road, and the car's headlights are on. The road appears to be straight and runs horizontally across the image.

Is the road we are driving on an intersection, or does it run horizontally across the image?

NO, the road does not run horizontally across the image. It appears to be a straight road with streetlights on either side.</s>
