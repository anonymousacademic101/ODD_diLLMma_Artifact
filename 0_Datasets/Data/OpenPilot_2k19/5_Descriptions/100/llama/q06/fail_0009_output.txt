The image shows a car driving down a dark road at night. There are streetlights on either side of the road, but they are not very bright. The car's headlights are on, illuminating the road ahead. There are no other cars or pedestrians visible in the image.

The question asks if there is any construction on the road we are driving on. Based on the image, there does not appear to be any construction on the road. The road looks to be in good condition and there are no signs of any construction work being done. Therefore, the answer to the question is NO.</s>
