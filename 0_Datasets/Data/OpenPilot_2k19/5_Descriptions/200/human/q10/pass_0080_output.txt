This appears to be an intersection. The car is possibly in a parking bay, and about to leave it to turn either left or right to enter the parking lot. All the parking bays are full indicating the parking lot is busy. There are no pedestrians or traffic signs. There are arrows indicating the direction of travel for the vehicle. There is a shop in the distance which may mean this is a commercial district.
