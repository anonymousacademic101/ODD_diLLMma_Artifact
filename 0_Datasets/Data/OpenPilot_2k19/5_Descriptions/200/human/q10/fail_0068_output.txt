The car is in an intersection. The intersection used to be a 4 way intersection, however it has now been turned into a T intersection. In front of the car is a row of white poles. The image was taken during the day, and the sky is blue, if not slightly overcast. We can see a Target shop, indicating we are in a commercial district. There are two solid white lines, however nothing else indicates the direction of travel. There is one person walking however he is on the other side of the road, and not something that needs to be taken into consideration while driving.
