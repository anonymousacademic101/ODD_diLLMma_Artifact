The car is parked on the right of the road. The image was taken either at dawn or dusk as the sun is low in the sky. There is another car parked in front of the vehicle. To the left is a building and to the right is what appears to be a parking lot. The road has no markings and there appears to be no traffic, other than parked vehicles.
