The image was taken during the day on a 4 or 5 lane highway. The sky appears to be slightly overcast based on the amount of light out. Each of the lanes are marked clearly. The road appears to be a bridge based on the concrete barriers railings. To the right is a set of trees, and to the left is a gap before the road in the opposite directions bridge can be seen. There is very little traffic on the road.
