The car is driving on an off ramp based on the sign which states exit. The off ramp however is straight and narrow, only capable of taking one vehicle at a time. There is a solid yellow and white line on either side. To the right of the image is an embankment with grass. There are no pedestrians, and the image was taken during the day with blue skies.
