This image shows a car parked on the shoulder along a road. The image was taken during the day. To the left is an embankment with trees, bushes and grass. To the right is a yellow solid line. Following that is a road with trees. It is difficult to tell how many lanes the road is as there are no clear lane markings. There are no road signs, and no cars. There are no pedestrians.
