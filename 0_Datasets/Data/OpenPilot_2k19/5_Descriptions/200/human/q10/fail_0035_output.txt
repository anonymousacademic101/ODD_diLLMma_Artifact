The car appears to be in an intersection with a lot of traffic. There is a black car entering the intersection passing through the traffic traveling perpendicular to the current car. In Front of that is a green hedge and a house indicating that the car is in a residential neighborhood. The image was taken during the day, as the sky is blue. The traffic has a firetruck, however its lights are not on, indicating it's not in an emergency.
