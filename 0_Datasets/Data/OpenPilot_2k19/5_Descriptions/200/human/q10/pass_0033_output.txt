The image was taken during the day. It is on a four lane highway. There is a truck and a car on the highway meaning that there is little to no traffic. There is a green information sign to the left. To the left is an embankment with grass. To the right is a metal barrier with trees. There are no other signs, lane markings or pedestrians. The lane markings are clear and easy to read. The road is straight.
