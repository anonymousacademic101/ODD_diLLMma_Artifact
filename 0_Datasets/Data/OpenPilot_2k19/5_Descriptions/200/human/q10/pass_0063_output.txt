The image was taken in a parking lot with shops. The image was taken during the day with a clear blue sky. There is a TJ Maxx and Party City in front of the vehicle indicating that the vehicle is in a commercial district. There is an intersection coming up, however it's around 10 meters away and so it can drive straight for a while before having to turn.
