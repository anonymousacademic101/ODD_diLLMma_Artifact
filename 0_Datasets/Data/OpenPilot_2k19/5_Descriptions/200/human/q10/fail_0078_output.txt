The car appears to be in an intersection using one of the lanes dedicated to turning right without having to stop at the intersection. The image was taken during the day and there are a few clouds in the sky. There is one other car in front of this one also turning to the right. There are several vehicles waiting at the intersection traveling perpendicular to the direction the car is currently moving. There is a solid white line indicating the car has to turn right.
