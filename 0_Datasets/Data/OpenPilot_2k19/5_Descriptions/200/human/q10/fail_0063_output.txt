This image was taken during the day and the sky is blue. The image appears to be just before or after a car is entering or exiting a parking space. You can see an empty parking bay in the parking lot, and all the other parking bays are full. There is a road on the other side of the parking lot with a vehicle traveling perpendicular to the current direction of the car. Although this is separated by a sidewalk. In the distance there is a target indicating that the car is in a commercial zone.
