The image is of a road at night. The road is a 4 lane highway that is straight. There are several vehicles on the road showing medium traffic. There is a solid yellow line to the left of the vehicle. There is a concrete barrier past that. It is unclear what is to the left of the vehicle due to the darkness. The road however is straight and has clear lane markings. There is a green information sign coming up but it's hard to see what is on it. There are no pedestrians or other road markings.
