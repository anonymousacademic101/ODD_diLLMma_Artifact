The image was taken during the night. The image was taken on a 4 lane highway that is curving gently to the right. There is a sign but it's hard to read what it says. There are only a few vehicles on the road, indicating little traffic. The lane markings are clean and easy to see. To the left appears to be a concrete barrier. The right is empty space.
