This image shows a car pulling up to a small store. The image was taken during the day, as the sky is blue. It is unclear what the store sells, but looks like a typical store from a gas station. There are two other cars parked outside the store. There are no road markings, no pedestrians, no traffic signs. The car will have to either turn left or right in the image, or it could park by the store.
