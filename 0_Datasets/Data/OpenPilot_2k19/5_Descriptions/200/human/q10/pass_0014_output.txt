The image shows a car driving through a McDonalds drive through. The road is narrow, and there is a yellow arrow on the road indicating the direction of travel. To the left of the image is a wall, and to the right is a median with a hedge on it. There is one car in front of the vehicle also in the drive through. That car is turning sharp to the right. The image was taken during the day, with clear blue skies.
