This image shows an intersection. The image was taken during the day and the sky is blue. The intersection appears to be in a parking lot. The parking lot has many cars parked there with many of the parking bays full. The back of the stop signs of the intersection can be seen. The words stop are written on the road. There are a few solid lines indicating where pedestrians can walk. There are no pedestrians in the image though.
