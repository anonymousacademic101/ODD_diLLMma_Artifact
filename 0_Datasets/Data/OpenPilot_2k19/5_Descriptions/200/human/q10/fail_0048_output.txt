The image was taken during the day, however it seems overcast. The car is parked in an intersection with traffic lights that are green. There are 3 other cars in the intersection all traveling in the opposite direction to the ego vehicle. There is a single solid white line indicating the direction the ego vehicle must travel. There is no u-turn sign in the distance. There is a pedestrian crossing to the left of the image. This appears to be a residential neighborhood.
