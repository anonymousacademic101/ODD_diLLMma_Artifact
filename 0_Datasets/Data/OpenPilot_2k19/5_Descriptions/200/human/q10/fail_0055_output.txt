This image was taken at night. To the left is a Verizon shop, indicating you are in a commercial zone. Directly in front of the vehicle is another jeep whose brake lights are bright and causing glare on the windshield. The car appears to be just about to enter an intersection based on poles with signs indicating the direction each lane can turn. The car appears to be making a sharp turn to get into this lane. To the left of the car is a median with small shrubs. The car appears to be on a 2 lane road.
