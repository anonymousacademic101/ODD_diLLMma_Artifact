The image was taken during the day. It is hard to see where the road goes to the left. The road has a few solid white line markings, and an arrow indicating the direction of travel. Directly in front of the road are trees, which formed a sort of fork in the road. There are no road signs, pedestrians, or other traffic in the image.
