The image was taken during the day. The image shows a car driving down a 3 lane road separated by a median with trees and dirt to the left. There are several cars on the road indicating medium traffic. There are a row of cars on the right parked against the side of the road. There are no pedestrians, or road signs visible. The sun is causing a slight glare on the window, but it's not bad enough to cause confusion while driving.
