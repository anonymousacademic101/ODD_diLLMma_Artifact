The image was taken during the day. The car is driving on a 4 or 5 lane highway. The car appears to be driving over a bridge, based on the railings on the concrete barriers to the left and right of the image. There are around 5 or 6 cars on the road indicating medium traffic. There are no pedestrians or signs on the road. The lane markings aren't great, however you are able to identify the lanes. There are trees indicating that the highway is not near a built up area.
