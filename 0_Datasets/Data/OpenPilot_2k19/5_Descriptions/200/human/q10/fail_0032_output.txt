The road appears to be exiting a gas station. The image was taken during the day, and the sun is causing reflections on the windscreen making it hard to see. The gas station does not appear to have other vehicles. However the road attached to the gas station does have several vehicles traveling on it. THere is are two trees directly ahead of the vehicle.
