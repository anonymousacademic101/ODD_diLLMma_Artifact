This image was taken during the day. The image shows the car parked on a 4 lane road in traffic. There is a distinct pointy roof in the distance. To the left of the road is a median with grass growing on it. Ahead is an intersection, but it is so far away you can not see the traffic lights' color, only their outline. There are no road signs, or pedestrians. The lane markings are clear.
