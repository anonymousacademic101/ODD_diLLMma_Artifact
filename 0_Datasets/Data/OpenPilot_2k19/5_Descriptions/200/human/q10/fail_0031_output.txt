The car is turning into a gas station. The image was taken during the day, and the glare from the sun on the windscreen is causing reflections that make it hard to see from the camera's perspective. It is hard to tell if any vehicles are at the gas station, however there are several vehicles on the road the car is traveling on. There is a hedge separating the gas station from the road. There are no pedestrians to be seen. The road seems to be in good condition.
