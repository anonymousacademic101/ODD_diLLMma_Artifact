The car is traveling on a 2 lane empty road. The road is well marked and the lanes easy to see. The image was taken at night and the road appears to have empty space to both the left and right of the road. There is what appears to be a small median to the right, followed by another lane. There are some white markings on the road ahead however they are a little too far away to be read. The road is straight with no curves.
