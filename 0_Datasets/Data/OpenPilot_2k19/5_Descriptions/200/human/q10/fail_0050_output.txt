This image was taken at night. The car is at a T intersection, and either must make a sharp left or right turn. Against the T intersection is a parking lot. A car in that parking lot has its headlights on that are shining directly into the camera causing glare. There are no road markings or signs. However it appears to be a commercial area with shops.
