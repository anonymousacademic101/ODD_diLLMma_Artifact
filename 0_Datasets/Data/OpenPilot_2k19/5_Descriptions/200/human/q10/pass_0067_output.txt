The image was taken during the day. There are a few clouds in the sky making it appear slightly overcast. There is no drivable area moving forward. This indicates you are possible in a parking lot. Directly in front of the vehicle is a median with small shrubs. Ahead of that is a Target, indicating you are in a commercial zone, further suggesting you are in a parking lot. Passing the median is a road with a vehicle on it, indicating there is some traffic. There are no road signs or pedestrians.
