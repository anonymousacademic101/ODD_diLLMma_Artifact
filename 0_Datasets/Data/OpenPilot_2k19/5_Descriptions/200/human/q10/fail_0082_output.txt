The car appears to be at a fork in the road, based on its position. However it is more likely that this is an intersection. To the left is a bridge that we will be driving over. To the right is a line of cars. The traffic light has a green turn arrow. Directly in front of us is a metal fence with green bushes. The image was taken during the day.
