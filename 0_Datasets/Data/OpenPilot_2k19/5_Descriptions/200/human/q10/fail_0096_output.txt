The car is currently in an intersection. The traffic lights in the intersection are green, and there is a white sign indicating which lanes can perform which turns. There are small white dots in the intersection indicating how a car should turn. In front of the vehicle are trees and a few cars traveling in the opposite direction the car is currently traveling in. The image was taken during the day, and the sky has clouds. There are no pedestrians to worry about. There is a traffic cone indicating there may have been some construction. However as it is not on the road, it is not a concern.
