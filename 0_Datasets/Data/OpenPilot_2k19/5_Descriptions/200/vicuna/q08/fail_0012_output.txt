YES, the road we are driving on is narrow and winding.

The road we are driving on is narrow and winding because it is located in a mountainous area. The road is built to follow the contours of the terrain, which makes it narrow and winding. Additionally, the road may have been built with limited funding, which could have resulted in a narrower and more winding road.
