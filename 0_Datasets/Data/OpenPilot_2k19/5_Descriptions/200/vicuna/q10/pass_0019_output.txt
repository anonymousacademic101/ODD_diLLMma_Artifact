This image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down a street. The car is parked at a drive-thru window of a fast food restaurant. The restaurant has a yellow and white sign with the name "McDonald's" written in large letters. The drive-thru window has a menu board with various food items listed. The car in front of us has pulled up to the window and is waiting to place an order. There is a person in the car, but we cannot see their face. The time of day appears to be morning, as there are no other cars on the street and the sky is still dark. The road is straight and there are no pedestrians or other vehicles in sight.
