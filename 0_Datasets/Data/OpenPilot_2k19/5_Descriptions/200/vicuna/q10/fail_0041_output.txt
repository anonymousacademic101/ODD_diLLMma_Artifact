The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down a city street. The street is lined with trees on both sides and there are buildings visible in the background. The road has two lanes, one for traffic heading in each direction. There is a traffic light at the intersection, with a green light for traffic heading straight through the intersection, a red light for traffic turning left, and a yellow light for traffic turning right. There are no pedestrians visible in the image. The time of day appears to be daytime, based on the bright sunlight shining through the trees on the left side of the image.
