The image shows a busy street at night. The street is lined with streetlights and there are several cars and trucks parked on the side of the road. There is a traffic light at the intersection, showing a red light for the cars coming from the left and a green light for the cars coming from the right. There are also several pedestrians walking on the sidewalk, some of them holding umbrellas to protect themselves from the rain. The time of day appears to be late evening or night, as the sky is dark and there are no visible daylight sources.
