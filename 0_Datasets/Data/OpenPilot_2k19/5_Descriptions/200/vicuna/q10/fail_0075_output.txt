This image shows a view of a city street from the perspective of a driver in a car. The street is lined with tall buildings on both sides, some of which have balconies and windows. The road surface appears to be wet, and there are no visible road markings or signs. There are no other vehicles visible in the image, but there are a few pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The time of day appears to be cloudy and overcast, which may make it more difficult to see the road ahead.
