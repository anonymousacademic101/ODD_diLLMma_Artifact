This image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down a city street at night. The street is lined with streetlights and trees, and there are buildings on either side of the road. The road has two lanes, one for traffic heading in each direction. There are no pedestrians visible in the image. The time of day appears to be night, as the sky is dark and there are no visible sunlight or shadows. The image was likely taken from a moving vehicle, as there is a slight blur to the buildings and streetlights.
