This image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving down a highway at night. The road is straight and has two lanes in each direction. There are no visible road signs or pedestrians in the image. The time of day appears to be night, as the sky is dark and there are no visible streetlights. The car's headlights are illuminating the road ahead, and the taillights are visible in the distance.
