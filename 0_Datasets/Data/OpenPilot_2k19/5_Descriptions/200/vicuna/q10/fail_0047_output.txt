This is a view of a city street from the perspective of a driver in a car. The street is lined with trees and buildings on both sides. There are several cars parked on the side of the road, and several pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk. There is a gas station on the left side of the road, with a sign that reads "Gas" and a price of $3.50 per gallon. The time of day is morning, as there are still some lights on in the buildings and the sun is just starting to rise in the sky. The weather is clear and sunny.
