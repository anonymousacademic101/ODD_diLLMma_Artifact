This image shows a gas station at night. The gas station is located on a busy road, with multiple lanes for incoming and outgoing traffic. The gas pumps are on the left side of the image, and the building is on the right side. The building has a blue and white sign that reads "Gas Station" in large letters. The parking lot is mostly empty, with only a few cars parked haphazardly. There are no pedestrians visible in the image. The time of day appears to be night, as the sky is dark and there are no lights on in the building or on the gas pumps. The image is taken from the driver's perspective, looking out the front windshield of a car.
