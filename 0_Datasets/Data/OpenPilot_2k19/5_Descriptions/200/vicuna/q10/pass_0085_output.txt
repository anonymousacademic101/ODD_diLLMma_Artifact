This is a video taken from the driver's perspective of a car driving down a highway. The road is straight and has two lanes in each direction. There are trees on both sides of the road and some buildings can be seen in the distance. The time of day appears to be dusk or dawn, as the sky is dimly lit. There are other cars on the road, driving in both directions, and some pedestrians can be seen walking on the sidewalk. The road signs are not visible in this video.
