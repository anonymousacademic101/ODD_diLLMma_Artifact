Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a road with a concrete overpass above it, and there are cars driving on the road below the overpass. The overpass appears to be an on-off ramp, as it has a lane that merges onto the highway, and a lane that exits the highway. The cars driving on the road below the overpass are traveling in the same direction as the traffic on the highway, indicating that the road is an on-off ramp.
