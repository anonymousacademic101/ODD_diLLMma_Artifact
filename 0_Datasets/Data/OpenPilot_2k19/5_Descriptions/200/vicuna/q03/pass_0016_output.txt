YES, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a car driving on a road that appears to be an on-off ramp. There are trees on both sides of the road, and buildings can be seen in the background. The car is driving towards the camera, and it appears to be on an on-ramp, as there is a solid white line on the right side of the road, and a dashed white line on the left side of the road.
