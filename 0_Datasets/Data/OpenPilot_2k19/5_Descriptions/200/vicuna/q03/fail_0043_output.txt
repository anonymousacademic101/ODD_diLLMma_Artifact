Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The on-off ramp is a type of road that allows vehicles to enter or exit a controlled-access highway, such as a freeway or motorway. On-off ramps typically have traffic signals or signs to control the flow of traffic and ensure that vehicles enter and exit the highway safely. In the image, we can see a row of parked cars on the left side of the road, which suggests that we are on an on-off ramp. Additionally, the road appears to be elevated, which is another characteristic of an on-off ramp.
