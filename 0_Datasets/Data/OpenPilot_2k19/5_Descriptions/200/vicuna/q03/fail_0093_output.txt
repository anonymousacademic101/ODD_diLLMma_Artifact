Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving on a road that appears to be an on-off ramp. The road has a yellow line down the middle, and there are trees and other vegetation on either side of the road. The sky appears to be cloudy and there is a blue sign on the right side of the road that is partially obscured by trees.
