Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a parking garage with a car parked in front of the entrance. The car is parked on the right side of the image and the entrance to the parking garage is on the left side of the image. The road in front of the parking garage appears to be an on-off ramp, as there are no other cars visible on the road and the road seems to lead directly to the entrance of the parking garage. Additionally, the road appears to be a continuation of the road that is visible in the background of the image, which suggests that it is an on-off ramp.
