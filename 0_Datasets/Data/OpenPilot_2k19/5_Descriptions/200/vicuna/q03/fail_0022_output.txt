Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a city street with buildings on either side and a car driving on the road. The road appears to be an on-off ramp, as there is a divider in the middle of the road and cars are driving on it in both directions. The buildings on either side of the road suggest that this is a city street, and the fact that there is a divider in the middle of the road indicates that it is an on-off ramp.
