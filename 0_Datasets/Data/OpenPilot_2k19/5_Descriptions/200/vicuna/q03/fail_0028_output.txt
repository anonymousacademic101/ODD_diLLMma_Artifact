Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a dark tunnel with a road running through it. The road appears to be an on-off ramp, as there is a sign indicating that it is an entrance or exit to a highway or other major road. The lighting in the tunnel is dim, with only a faint glow coming from the end of the tunnel. There are no other vehicles or people visible in the image.
