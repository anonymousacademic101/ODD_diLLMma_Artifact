Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving on a road at night. The road appears to be an on-off ramp, as there is a solid white line on the left side of the road and a dashed white line on the right side of the road. The car is driving on the right side of the road, and there are other vehicles driving in the opposite direction on the left side of the road. There are also streetlights on both sides of the road, illuminating the area.
