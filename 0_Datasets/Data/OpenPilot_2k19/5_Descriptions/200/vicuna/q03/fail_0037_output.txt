Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving on a road with trees on both sides. The road appears to be an on-off ramp, as there is a solid white line on the right side of the road, indicating that it is an entrance or exit to a highway or other major road. The road also has a yellow line down the center, which is common for on-off ramps. Additionally, there are no other cars visible in the image, which suggests that we are driving on an on-off ramp that is not currently being used by other vehicles.
