Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a car driving on a road that appears to be an on-off ramp. The car is driving towards a building with white doors, which is likely a store or business. The road has a yellow line down the middle, indicating that it is a divided road. There are no other cars visible in the image, so it is likely that the car is driving during off-peak hours. The image also shows a parking meter on the side of the road, which suggests that the building has a parking lot.
