Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving on a road. The road appears to be an on-off ramp, as there is a stop sign on the right side of the road, indicating that traffic coming from the right must stop before proceeding straight or turning left onto the main road. The trees on the left side of the road and the buildings in the background suggest that we are driving in a suburban or urban area.
