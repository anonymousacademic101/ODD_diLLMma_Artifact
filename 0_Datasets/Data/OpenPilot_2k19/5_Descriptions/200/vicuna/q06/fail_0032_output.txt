Yes, there is construction on the road we are driving on.

The image shows a view from the driver's seat of a car driving on a road with construction taking place on the side of the road. The road appears to be a city street with buildings and trees on either side, and there are construction barriers and cones on the side of the road. The sun is shining and there are clouds in the sky.
