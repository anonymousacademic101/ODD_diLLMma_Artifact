Yes, the road we are driving on is an intersection.

The image shows a parking lot with several cars parked in front of a building. The building has a white fa√ßade with large windows and a sign that reads "McDonald's." The road in front of the building appears to be an intersection, as there is a stop sign on the right side of the image and a yield sign on the left side. Additionally, there are streetlights on both sides of the road, indicating that it is a public road.
