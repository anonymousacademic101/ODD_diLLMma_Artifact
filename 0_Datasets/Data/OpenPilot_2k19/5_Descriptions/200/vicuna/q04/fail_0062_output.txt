Yes, the road in the image runs horizontally across the image.

The image shows a parking lot with several cars parked in it. The cars are parked in rows, with some cars facing forward and some facing backward. The cars are parked in such a way that they take up most of the space in the parking lot. The parking lot appears to be empty, with no people or other vehicles in sight. The sky is cloudy and overcast, which gives the scene a dull and gloomy look. The image is taken from a driver's perspective, looking out the front windshield of a car.
