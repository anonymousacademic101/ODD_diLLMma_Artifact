The image shows a car driving down a street in front of a Walgreens store at night. The car is parked in front of the store, and there are people walking in and out of the store. The street is lit by streetlights, and there are no other cars or pedestrians visible in the image.

The answer to the question is NO, because the road is not a sharp curve. The road is straight and flat, and there are no signs of a curve in the image.</s>
