The image shows a car driving on a dark road at night. The headlights of the car are on, illuminating the road ahead. There are no other cars or pedestrians visible in the image.

The road appears to be straight and flat, with no sharp curves or obstacles in sight. The car is traveling at a moderate speed, and the driver appears to be paying attention to the road ahead.

Therefore, the answer to the question is NO, the road is not a sharp curve.</s>
