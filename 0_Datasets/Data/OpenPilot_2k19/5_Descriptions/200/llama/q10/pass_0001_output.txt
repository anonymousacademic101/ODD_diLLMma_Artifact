The image shows a street at night with cars driving in both directions on the crosswalk. There are streetlights on both sides of the road, casting a yellowish light on the asphalt. The cars are traveling at a moderate speed, and there are no pedestrians or other vehicles visible in the image. The time of day appears to be around 9 or 10 pm, based on the shadows cast by the streetlights. The sky is dark and cloudy, with a few stars visible in the distance. The image is taken from the driver's seat of a car traveling in the same direction as the other vehicles on the road.</s>
