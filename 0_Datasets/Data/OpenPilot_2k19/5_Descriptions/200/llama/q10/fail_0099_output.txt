The image shows a driveway leading up to a house with a garage on the right side. The driveway is made of asphalt and has a few cracks in it. There are two trees on either side of the driveway, one on the left and one on the right. The trees are trimmed and have green leaves. The house is a two story with a gabled roof and a chimney on the left side. There is a car parked in the driveway in front of the house. The car is a silver sedan with tinted windows. There are no pedestrians or other vehicles visible in the image. The time of day is difficult to determine from the image, but it appears to be daytime based on the shadows on the trees and the house. There are no road signs or traffic visible in the image.</s>
