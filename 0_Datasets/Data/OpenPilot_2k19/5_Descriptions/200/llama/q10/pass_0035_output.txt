The image shows a road at night with cars driving in both directions. There are streetlights on both sides of the road and a few pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The time of day appears to be around 9 or 10 pm based on the position of the sun and the shadows on the road. The road appears to be in good condition with no potholes or other damage. There are no other vehicles parked on the side of the road. The image is taken from the driver's seat of a car traveling in the same direction as the other cars on the road.</s>
