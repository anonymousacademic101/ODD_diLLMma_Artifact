The image shows a street with several buildings on either side. The buildings are made of brick and have multiple floors. There are cars parked along the side of the road, and a few pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk. The sky is cloudy and there is a light mist in the air. The time of day is difficult to determine, but it appears to be early in the morning or late in the afternoon. There are no other vehicles visible in the image.</s>
