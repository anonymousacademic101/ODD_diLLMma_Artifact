The image shows a car driving down a dark road at night. There are streetlights on either side of the road, but they are not very bright. The car's headlights are on, illuminating the road ahead. There are no other cars or pedestrians visible in the image.

The question asks if the road we are driving has any restricted lanes, such as for buses or bicycles. Based on the image, there do not appear to be any restricted lanes on the road. Therefore, the answer is NO.</s>
