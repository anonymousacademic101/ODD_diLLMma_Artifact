The image shows a car driving down the street in front of a Walgreens store at night. The car is parked in front of the store, and the driver is looking out the window. There are no other cars or pedestrians visible in the image.

The answer to the question is NO, because there are no other cars or pedestrians visible in the image. The road does not have any restricted lanes, such as for buses or bicycles, because there are no buses or bicycles visible in the image.</s>
