The image is of a road at night with streetlights on either side of the road. There are two cars parked on the side of the road, one with its headlights on and the other with its headlights off. The road is empty and there are no other vehicles or pedestrians visible in the image.

The question is asking if the road has any restricted lanes, such as for buses or bicycles. The answer is no, as there are no signs or markings indicating that any lanes are restricted. Additionally, there are no other vehicles or pedestrians visible in the image, so there is no need for any restricted lanes.</s>
