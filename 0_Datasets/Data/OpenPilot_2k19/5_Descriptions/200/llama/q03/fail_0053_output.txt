The image shows a car driving down a street in front of a Walgreens store at night. The car is parked in front of the store, and there are people walking in and out of the store. The street is lit by streetlights, and there are no other cars or pedestrians visible in the image.

The answer to the question is NO, because the road is not an on-off ramp. An on-off ramp is a road that connects a highway to a local road, allowing traffic to enter or exit the highway. The road in the image does not appear to be an on-off ramp, as it does not connect to a highway or have any other features that would indicate it is an on-off ramp.</s>
