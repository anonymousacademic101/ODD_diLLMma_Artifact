The image shows a road with a hill in the background. The road is empty and there are no cars or pedestrians in sight. The sky is cloudy and there is no sunlight visible.

The answer to your question is NO, the road is not hilly. The hill is visible in the background, but it is not a significant feature of the road. The road is flat and straight, with no curves or bends in sight.</s>
