The image shows a car driving down a dark road at night. The car's headlights illuminate the road ahead, but the rest of the image is dark. There are no other cars or people visible in the image.

The question asks if the road we are driving on is hilly. Based on the image, it appears that the road is flat, as there are no hills visible in the image. Therefore, the answer is NO.</s>
