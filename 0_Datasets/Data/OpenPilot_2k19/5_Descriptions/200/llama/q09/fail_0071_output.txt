The image shows a gas station at night with a car parked in front of it. The car's headlights are on and the driver is looking out the window. The gas pumps are visible in the background, and there are streetlights on either side of the road. The sky is dark and there are stars visible in it.

The answer to your question is NO. The road we are driving on is not hilly because there are no hills visible in the image. The road appears to be flat and straight.</s>
