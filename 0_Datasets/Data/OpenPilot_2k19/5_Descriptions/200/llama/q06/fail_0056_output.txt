The image shows a car driving down a dark road at night. There are streetlights on either side of the road, but they are not illuminated. The car's headlights are on, but they are not shining directly on the road. There are no other cars or pedestrians visible in the image.

Therefore, the answer to the question is NO, there is no construction on the road we are driving on.</s>
