The image shows a dark tunnel with streetlights on either side of the road. There are no cars or other vehicles visible in the tunnel, and the only light comes from the streetlights.

The answer to your question is NO, there is no construction on the road we are driving on. The tunnel appears to be empty and dark, with no signs of any work being done on it.</s>
