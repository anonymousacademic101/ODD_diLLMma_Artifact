Yes, this image has poor visibility due to heavy rain, snow, fog, or adverse weather conditions. The road is wet and there are puddles of water on it, making it difficult to see what's ahead. Additionally, the lighting is poor, with only the headlights of the car illuminating the road. This makes it difficult to see any obstacles or hazards in the road.</s>
