The image shows a car driving down a dark road at night. The headlights of the car illuminate the road ahead, but the rest of the image is dark. There are no streetlights or other sources of light visible in the image. Therefore, the visibility is poor due to heavy rain, snow, fog, or adverse weather conditions.</s>
