The image shows a parking lot with several cars parked in it. The cars are parked in a row, with some of them facing the camera and others facing away from it. There are no pedestrians or other vehicles visible in the image.

The road in the image runs horizontally across the image, from left to right. It appears to be a paved road with a few cars parked on it. There are no other vehicles or pedestrians visible in the image.

Therefore, the answer to the question is NO.</s>
