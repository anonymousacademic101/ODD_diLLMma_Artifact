The image shows a car parked in a parking lot next to a building with a red and white striped awning over the entrance. The car is parked at an angle to the curb, and the driver's side door is open. There are no other cars or pedestrians visible in the image.

The road we are driving on is not an intersection, but rather a straight road that runs horizontally across the image. The car is parked at an angle to the curb, and the driver's side door is open. There are no other cars or pedestrians visible in the image.
