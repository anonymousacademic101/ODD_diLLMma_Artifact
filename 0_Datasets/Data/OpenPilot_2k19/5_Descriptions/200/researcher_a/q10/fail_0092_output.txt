The image was taken during the day. The car is parked on the shoulder of a road. To the left of the car is an embankment with trees, grass and bushes. To the right is a solid yellow line, and to the right of that the road. To the right of the road are trees. There is one car on the road, however it is unclear how many lanes there are on the road. There are no visible road markings other than the yellow line and a white line on the other side. There are no road signs or pedestrians.
