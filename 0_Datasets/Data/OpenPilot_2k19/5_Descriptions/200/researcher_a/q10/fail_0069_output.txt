The image was taken during the day. The image shows a car at a fork in the road. The fork has a road to the left and right. This fork could be due to an intersection. Directly ahead of the vehicle is a parking lot that is full with cars. There are lane markings indicating where pedestrians can cross the road. There are no pedestrians or road signs visible. This appears to be a commercial district based on the shops in the distance, and the parking lot.
