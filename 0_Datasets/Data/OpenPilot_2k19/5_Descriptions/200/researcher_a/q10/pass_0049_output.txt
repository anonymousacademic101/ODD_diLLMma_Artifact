The car is driving on a 3 or 4 lane highway. The car is driving in the middle lane. The image was taken during the day. There is very little traffic with only a few cars on the road. The road appears to be in good condition. There is a concrete barrier to the left, and trees on an embankment to the right. The road is relatively straight, with a very slight curve to the right up ahead. There is a green information sign far in the distance.
