This image was taken during the day. The image shows a car in a parking lot. In front of the car is a sidewalk for pedestrians, and then there is a road with a car traveling perpendicular to the direction the ego vehicle is traveling. There is a Target in the distance indicating we are in a commercial district. There are no street signs, or pedestrians. The only drivable area is a parking bay with a car on either side.
