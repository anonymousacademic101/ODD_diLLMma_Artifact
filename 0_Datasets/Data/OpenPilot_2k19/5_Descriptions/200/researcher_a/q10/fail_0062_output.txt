This image was taken during the day. The image shows the car in a parking lot just before entering or exiting a parking bay. The only parking bay that is open is the one the ego car is leaving or entering. All the other parking bays are full. In the distance there is a Target indicating that this is a commercial zone. There is a road across the sidewalk which has a car traveling perpendicular to all the parked cars. There are no street signs, there are no pedestrians, and no lane markings.
