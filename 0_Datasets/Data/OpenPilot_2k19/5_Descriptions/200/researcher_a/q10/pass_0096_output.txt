The image shows a car driving under a bridge during the day. There are no pedestrians, or road signs. However the road markings and lane lines are clear. There are two solid lines and arrows indicating that both this and the lane next to us are turned left only. There are a bunch of pillars separating us and the road to the left. There are 2 other cars in the image to the right.
