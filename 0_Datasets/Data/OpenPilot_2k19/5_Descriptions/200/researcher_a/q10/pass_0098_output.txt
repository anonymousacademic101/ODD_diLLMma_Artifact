The image was taken during the day with a blue sky and a few clouds. The car is currently on a 4 lane road. The car appears to be sitting in traffic with several vehicles all around the current vehicle. To the left of the vehicle are 2 solid white lines indicating a turn only lane. Past that is a set of metal barriers to stop pedestrians crossing. To the right is a sidewalk. There are no pedestrians or road signs. Directly ahead are traffic lights.
