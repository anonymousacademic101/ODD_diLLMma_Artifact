The image was taken at night. The car is driving on a 4 lane highway. The car is in the right most lane. To the left is a shoulder and a concrete barrier. There is traffic all around the vehicle indicating a traffic jam. The road is in good condition with clear lines. The break lines in front of the car are bright causing glare in the window however visibility is still good.
