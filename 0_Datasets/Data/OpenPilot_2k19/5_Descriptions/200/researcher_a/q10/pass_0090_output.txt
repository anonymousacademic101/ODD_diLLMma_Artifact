The image was taken during the day on a 4 lane highway. To the left is a concrete barrier. To the right is an embankment with many trees. There are several vehicles on the road indicating that there is traffic. All traffic is going in the same direction. There are no visible street signs or road markings other than the lane markings which are clear. The road is in good condition.
