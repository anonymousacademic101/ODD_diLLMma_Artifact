The car is in a drive through behind another vehicle. The image was taken during the day and the sky is blue. There are no lane markings however the road is wide enough for vehicles to travel around any stationary cars in the drive through. To the left is a building and some pipes. To the right is what appears to be an empty lane that eventually meets the road.
