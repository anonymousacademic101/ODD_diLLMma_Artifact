This image was taken during the day. The car is on a 2 or 3 lane road. It is hard to tell, as there are no road markings. There is a green sign indicating the road name. There is only 1 other car on the road traveling in the same direction. There is a small median with lamp posts separating the direction of travel. To the right is another median which separates the road from what appears to be a house.
