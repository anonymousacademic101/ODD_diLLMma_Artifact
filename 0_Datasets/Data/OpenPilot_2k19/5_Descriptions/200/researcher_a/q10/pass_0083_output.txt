The car is driving on a 4 lane highway during the day. To the left is a metal barrier and to the right a concrete barrier. The left also appears to have an embankment with trees and grass. To the right are just trees. The road is in good condition, with clear lane markings. There are only 2 other cars visible in the image, suggesting very lite traffic.
