This image was taken during the day. However the exact time of day is hard to know as the sky can't be seen. This image is at a sharp corner in a McDonalds drive through. There is a car in front at the drive through. There are no pedestrians or road signs to follow. In front of the vehicle is the side of the McDonald's building, and a drive through window.
