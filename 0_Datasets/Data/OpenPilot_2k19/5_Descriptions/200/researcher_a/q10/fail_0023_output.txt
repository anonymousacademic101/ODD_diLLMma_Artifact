This image was taken at night. It shows a sharp corner. We can tell it's a sharp corner as there is a yellow diamond sign with a sharp corner label. This also appears to be a parking lot as there are several white lines which look like parking bays to the right. Ahead there is a hill with a wooden fence and some grass. There are no other road signs, pedestrians, or vehicles in the image.
