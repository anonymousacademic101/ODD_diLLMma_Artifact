The image was taken at night. The car is driving on a 4 lane highway. To the left is a concrete barrier. To the right is what appears to be empty space. The lane markings are clear, and there are no pedestrians, or signs visible. There are only a few cars in the distance indicating very little traffic. The road has a very gentle curve to the left.
