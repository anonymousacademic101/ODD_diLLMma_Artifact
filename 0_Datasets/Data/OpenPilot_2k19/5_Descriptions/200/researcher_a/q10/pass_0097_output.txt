The image shows a 4 lane highway during the day. The road has a few cars on it, which means the traffic is low. There is a road to the right with a few cars on it, however it is separated by solid white lines. The right curves gently to the right. There is a green information sign indicating the exit number. To the left of the road is an embankment with trees and grass. The image is slightly overcast.
