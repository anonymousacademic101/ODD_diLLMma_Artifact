This appears to be a 4 lane highway. There is a 5th lane to the right, separated by solid white lines. To the right is an embankment with grass and a single tree. The image was taken during the day and appears to be slightly overcast. There are very few vehicles on the road. There are no pedestrians or other road signs. To the right of the 5th lane is a metal barrier.
