This image was taken at night at an intersection. The intersection used to be a 4 way intersection, and now its a T intersection due to the white poles which have been placed here. There are two cars traveling to the right in the intersection. There Are no lane markings or signs indicating the direction the car can travel. There are a Verizon, party city, and tj max ahead indicating we are in a commercial district.
