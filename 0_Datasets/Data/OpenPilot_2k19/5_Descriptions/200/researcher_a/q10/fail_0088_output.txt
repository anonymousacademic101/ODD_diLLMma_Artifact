There is a person walking in the distance. Ahead of the fork in the road are trees. Going left shows a two lane road with lane markings on the road, and it is unclear what is to the right. There is a merge yellow diamond sign in the distance but it is far away. There is also a one way sign. There are some white information signs on the traffic light itself.
