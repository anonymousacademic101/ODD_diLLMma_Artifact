This image shows a 3 lane road. To the right is a gas station, and to the left is a pointy, unique roof. The road is separated by a median with dirt and trees. The image was taken during the day, and the sky is blue. There are many cars on the road indicating medium traffic. There is an intersection far away. However until then the road is straight. The lane markings are clear. There are no signs or pedestrians.
