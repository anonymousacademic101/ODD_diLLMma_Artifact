The image was taken during the day. The image was taken at a McDonalds drive through. There is a car in front of it. The building is to the left of the vehicle. There is a sharp turn that this vehicle will need to make. There doesn't appear to be any space to overtake the vehicle in front of you, however it is difficult to confirm that based on the current angle of the camera.
