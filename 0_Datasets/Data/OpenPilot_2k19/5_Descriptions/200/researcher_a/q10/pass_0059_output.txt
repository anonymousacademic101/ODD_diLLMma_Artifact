This appears to be a 4 or 5 lane highway. The image was taken during the day. There was some glare on the windscreen due to the sun reflecting on something on the dashboard. There are several cars on the road. There are also 3 green information signs, and a speed limit sign that is blocked by other vehicles. To the left is a concrete barrier. There are no pedestrians and the road appears in good condition.
