The image shows a scene during twilight or early evening where the brightness of the headlights is not overwhelming to the camera sensor. There is no evidence of direct sunlight, as the sky is overcast and the ambiance suggests it is either early evening or a heavily cloudy day. The headlights are visible but not extremely bright, indicating that the camera exposure is well-managed, and there is no glare from the lights that would typically indicate brightness issues.
