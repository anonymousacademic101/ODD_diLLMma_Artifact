NO.

There are no extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight visible in the image. The photo appears to have been taken at night, as indicated by the darkness surrounding the area illuminated by the car's headlights. The only source of light in the image seems to be the vehicle's own headlights shining on the road and a fence, and there is no glare or light flare that would suggest the presence of oncoming headlights or direct sunlight.
