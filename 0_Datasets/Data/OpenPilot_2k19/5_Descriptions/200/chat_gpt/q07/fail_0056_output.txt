NO

There do not appear to be any extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight into the camera in this image. The setting seems to be at night, and while there are various sources of light within the scene, such as the brake lights of cars and some ambient lighting from street lights and signage, none of these can be classified as extremely bright or as producing a glare that would significantly impact the camera's exposure or the driver's visibility.
