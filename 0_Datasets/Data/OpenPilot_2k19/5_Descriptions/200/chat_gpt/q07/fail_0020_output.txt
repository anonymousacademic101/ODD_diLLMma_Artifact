NO.

There are no extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight into the camera. The photo appears to be taken at night, and while there are multiple sources of artificial light, such as street lights, traffic signals, and vehicle headlights, none of them are overpowering or causing significant glare that would indicate extreme brightness into the camera's lens.
