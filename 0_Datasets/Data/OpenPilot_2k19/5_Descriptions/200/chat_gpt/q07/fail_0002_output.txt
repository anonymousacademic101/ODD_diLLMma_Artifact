NO.

The image shows a scene with a car approaching, but there's no indication of extreme brightness from headlights. There is some glare and a low sun in the background, probably indicative of a setting or rising sun, causing a bit of lens flare, but it's not directly into the camera or at an intensity that would be described as "extremely bright."
