NO.

The image lacks any form of extremely bright lights such as those that might come from oncoming headlights during night time or the harsh glare of direct sunlight that can cause significant lens flare or overexposure in a photograph. The sky appears clear with ample daylight, and there is no sign of the sun shining directly into the camera lens to create a bright light effect. The lighting in the image seems even and does not display any harsh bright spots that would indicate extreme lights from those sources.
