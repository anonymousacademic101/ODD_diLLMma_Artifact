NO

There are no extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights, nor is there direct sunlight into the camera in the provided image. The overall lighting in the scene appears to be even, and although there is a vehicle visible that is facing the camera, its headlights do not appear to be on, or they are not bright enough to cause glare or significant brightness in the image. The sky is overcast, which diffuses the sunlight and eliminates issues with direct sunlight.
