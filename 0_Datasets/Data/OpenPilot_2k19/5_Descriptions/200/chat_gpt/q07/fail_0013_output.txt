NO.

There are no signs of extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight into the camera. The photo was likely taken during an overcast day or at a time when the sun was not shining directly into the lens, resulting in a diffuse and even lighting across the scene. No harsh reflections or lens flare are evident, and the headlights of the cars in the image are not on or do not appear bright enough to be considered "extremely bright lights."
