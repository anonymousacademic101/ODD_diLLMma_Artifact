NO

There are no extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight into the camera visible in the image. It is an overcast day and the lighting suggests that the sun is not shining directly into the camera lens. The vehicles' headlights in the scene are not on or are not brightly illuminating the space, hence not creating extreme brightness.
