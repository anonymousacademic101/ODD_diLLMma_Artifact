There are street lights and the headlights of distant vehicles, but these do not appear to be extremely bright or directly shining into the camera to a significant degree. The illumination in the image is quite diffuse and not overpowering."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
