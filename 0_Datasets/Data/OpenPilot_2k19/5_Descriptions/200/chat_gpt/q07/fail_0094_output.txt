NO

There are no extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights, nor is there direct sunlight into the camera that would significantly impair visibility in this image. The sky is bright, but not to an extreme extent, and no other vehicles with headlights on are seen in the image. The overall lighting in the image seems even and does not contain harsh glares or reflections that would suggest the presence of extremely bright lights.
