NO.

The image appears to be taken at night, and there are no extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights, or direct sunlight into the camera visible in the image. The lighting present seems to be a combination of the vehicleâ€™s own headlights and possibly a small light source on the right side of the image (which appears to be a stationary light and not an oncoming vehicle's headlights). Direct sunlight is not present due to the nighttime setting.
