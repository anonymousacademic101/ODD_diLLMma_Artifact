The image shows a daytime scene viewed from inside a vehicle, and there don't appear to be any extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight into the camera. The lighting seems to be consistent with ambient daylight, and while there are reflections visible on the windshield, they do not appear to be harsh or glaring enough to be considered extremely bright lights.
