The image shows a nighttime traffic scene with visible taillights and ambient lighting. There are no extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight into the camera. The headlights and taillights visible are standard luminance, consistent with typical urban night driving conditions. There is glare from the rear lights of the vehicles, but it is not extremely bright to the extent that it would impair vision significantly. Direct sunlight is not present as it is clearly nighttime.
