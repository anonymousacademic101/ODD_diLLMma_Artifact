This glare is the result of the camera capturing the direct light from the vehicle\'s headlights, causing overexposure in those areas of the image. The bright light can be considered "extremely" in the sense that it stands out starkly and might cause difficulty for visibility when driving or when trying to see the details in the image. However, there is no direct sunlight as it is nighttime.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
