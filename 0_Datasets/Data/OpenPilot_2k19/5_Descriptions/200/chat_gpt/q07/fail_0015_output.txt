NO

The image does not show any extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight into the camera. The overall lighting appears to be diffuse, possibly due to cloudy or overcast conditions, and none of the vehicles visible in the image have their headlights on in a manner that would cause extreme brightness. There is no evidence of sunlight directly hitting the camera lens either.
