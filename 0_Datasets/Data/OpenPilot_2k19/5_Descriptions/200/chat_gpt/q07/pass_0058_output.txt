NO.

The image shows a nighttime scene on a road with vehicles at a distance, and there are no extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight visible. The headlights and taillights of the cars are visible but do not appear to be overwhelmingly bright or causing glare that would obscure the viewer's vision. There is a balance in the exposure that keeps the scene visible without any particular light source being overpowering.
