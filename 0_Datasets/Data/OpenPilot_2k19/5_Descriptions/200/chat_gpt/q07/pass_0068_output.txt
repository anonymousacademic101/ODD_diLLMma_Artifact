NO

The image appears to be taken during dusk or early evening hours, and while there are headlights visible from oncoming traffic, they are not extremely bright nor are they causing significant glare. The headlights are at a normal brightness level that would be expected from vehicles' lights at this time of day. There is no direct sunlight visible in the camera's field of view, as it seems the sun has already set or is not directly shining into the lens.
