NO.

The image shows a nighttime scene on a road with vehicle headlights in the distance, but they are not extremely bright nor are they causing significant glare. There is no evidence of direct sunlight as it is clearly dark outside, indicating it is likely night or very early in the morning before sunrise. The lighting in the photo is relatively dim, and no source of light is overpowering the camera's exposure.
