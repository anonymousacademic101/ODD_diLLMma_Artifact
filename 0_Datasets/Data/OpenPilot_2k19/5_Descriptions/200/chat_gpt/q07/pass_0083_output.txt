The image shows a scene of a roadway captured from a vehicle during a time when ambient light is sufficient, most likely dusk, and no extremely bright lights, such as from oncoming vehicles or direct sunlight, are shining towards the camera. It is a relatively balanced lighting situation without evidence of glare or overexposure that would typically be caused by strong light sources shining directly into the camera's lens.
