YES

Although the image isn't predominantly featuring extremely bright lights, there are multiple sources of bright light visible. There are headlights from oncoming vehicles in the upper middle part of the image that are bright compared to the surrounding area, and also there are bright lights on the building to the left. While these lights are not overpoweringly bright or directly shining into the camera causing significant glare, they are still relatively bright points of light within the image.
