The photo shows a night scene taken from inside a vehicle, and the brightness of the oncoming headlights or the taillights of the cars ahead is not enough to be considered "extremely bright." There is no direct sunlight because it's nighttime, and the lights from other vehicles are normal and do not cause a glare in the camera.
