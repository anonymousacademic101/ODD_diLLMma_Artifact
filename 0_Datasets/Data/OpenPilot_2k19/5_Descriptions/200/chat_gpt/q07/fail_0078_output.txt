There are no extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight into the camera in the image provided. The scene is well-lit with natural daylight, and although the sky is bright, it does not produce a glare that would constitute an extremely bright light. There’s a reflection visible on the windshield, but it’s diffuse and does not appear to be a direct or blinding light source.
