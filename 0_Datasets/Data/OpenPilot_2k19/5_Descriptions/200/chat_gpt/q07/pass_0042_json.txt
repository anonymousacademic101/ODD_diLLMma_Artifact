There are no extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights, as it appears to be daytime with overcast or cloudy weather, and the vehicles facing the camera do not have their headlights on or are too distant for the headlights to cause a glare. Additionally, there is no evidence of direct sunlight into the camera; the lighting is diffused and no harsh shadows or bright spots indicative of direct sunlight are visible.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
