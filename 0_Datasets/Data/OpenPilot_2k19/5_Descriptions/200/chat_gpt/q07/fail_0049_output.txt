NO.

The scene depicted in the image is during nighttime, and there is no evidence of extremely bright lights such as high-beam oncoming headlights or direct sunlight into the camera, which could cause significant glare or overexposure in the photo. The lights visible in the image appear to be from streetlights, vehicle taillights, and some distant traffic and business lights, which are typical for nighttime driving conditions and do not produce an excessively bright effect on the camera.
