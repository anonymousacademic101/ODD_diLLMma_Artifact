The image depicts a nighttime driving scene where the headlights from oncoming traffic are creating glare, which is notably bright against the darker surroundings. This glare is the result of the camera capturing the direct light from the vehicle's headlights, causing overexposure in those areas of the image. The bright light can be considered "extremely" in the sense that it stands out starkly and might cause difficulty for visibility when driving or when trying to see the details in the image. However, there is no direct sunlight as it is nighttime.
