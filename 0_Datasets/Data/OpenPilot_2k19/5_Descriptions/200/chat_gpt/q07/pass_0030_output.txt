The image appears to be taken during nighttime, and although there are multiple sources of light from vehicle headlights and taillights, none of them seem to be extremely bright to the point of causing significant glare or overexposure in the image. The lights do not appear to be shining directly into the camera, nor is there any direct sunlight, as it is not daytime. The lights are visible but not overwhelming in the scene, suggesting normal night-time driving conditions.
