NO.

There are no extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight into the camera in this image. The lighting appears to be even, and there is no evidence of glare from headlights or the sun that would suggest such brightness. The sky is partly cloudy and the natural light seems ambient and diffuse, not harsh or direct.
