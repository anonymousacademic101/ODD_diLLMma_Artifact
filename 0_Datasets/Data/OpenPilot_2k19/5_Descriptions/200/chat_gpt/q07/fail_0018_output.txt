NO.

There do not appear to be any extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight into the camera. The scene is set during nighttime with various artificial lights visible. Some headlights and taillights can be seen, along with streetlights and illuminated signs, but none of these sources are producing an intense glare or overly bright light that would obscure the camera's view. The lights are consistent with what you would expect from a normal night-time road scene and do not indicate extreme brightness.
