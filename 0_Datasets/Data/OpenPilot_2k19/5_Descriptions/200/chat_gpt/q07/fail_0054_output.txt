The image shows a nighttime scene typically illuminated by artificial lighting such as street lights and vehicle headlights. Although there are headlights from oncoming vehicles, they do not appear to be "extremely bright" in a way that would cause significant glare or overexposure in the camera. The lighting in this image seems to be fairly standard for night-time driving conditions, without any major sources of light that would blind the camera or viewer. There's also no direct sunlight, as it is clearly nighttime.
