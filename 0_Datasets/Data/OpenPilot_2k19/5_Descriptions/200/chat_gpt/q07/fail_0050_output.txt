The image shows a scenario at night where several oncoming vehicles' headlights are visible, some of which appear bright enough to be causing glare. Glare from headlights can result in extremely bright lights that may impair visibility, which is evident in this picture. There is no direct sunlight, as it is nighttime, but the headlights are providing the bright light in question.
