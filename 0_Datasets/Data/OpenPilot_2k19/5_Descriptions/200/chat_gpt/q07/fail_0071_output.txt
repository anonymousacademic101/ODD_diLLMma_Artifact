NO.

The image provided shows a night scene at a service station with several sources of artificial lighting, such as the station's canopy lights and the lights around the building. However, these lights are not excessively bright or glaring, nor do they resemble the intensity typical of oncoming headlights or direct sunlight. The lighting is typical for a well-lit service station at night and does not overpower the camera's exposure. There is no indication of oncoming headlights facing towards the camera, and it is night time, so there is no sunlight present.
