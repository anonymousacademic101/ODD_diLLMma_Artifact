The image shows oncoming vehicles with their headlights on, and there is an observable glare from these lights, which can be considered relatively bright in the context of the dark surroundings. However, they do not seem to be extremely bright as the scene is still visible, and there's no evidence of direct sunlight into the camera since the photograph appears to be taken at nighttime.
