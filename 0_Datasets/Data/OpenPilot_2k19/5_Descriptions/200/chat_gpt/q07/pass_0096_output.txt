NO

There are no extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight into the camera in this image. The lighting appears to be relatively even, and while there is brighter light outside of the underpass, it does not result in harsh glare or excessive brightness that would impair visibility. The headlights visible in the distance are not overexposed and do not create a glare that affects the camera's exposure.
