NO

There are no extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight into the camera. The scene appears to be evenly lit with diffuse lighting, suggesting it could be either an overcast day or the sun is not in direct line of sight with the camera. There is no glare or light flares that would indicate strong light sources aimed at the camera.
