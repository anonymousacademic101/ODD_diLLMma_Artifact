NO

The image appears to be taken at night with no oncoming traffic close enough to cause extremely bright lights from headlights. There also isn't any direct sunlight because it's nighttime. There are street lights and the headlights of distant vehicles, but these do not appear to be extremely bright or directly shining into the camera to a significant degree. The illumination in the image is quite diffuse and not overpowering.
