The image depicts a night scene taken from inside a vehicle, and there is a visible glare from oncoming vehicle headlights. The intensity of the lights is notable compared to the surrounding darkness, which classifies them as bright. The lights are not extremely bright to the point of overexposure or lens flare, but they are bright enough to be considered a significant source of light in this context. There is no direct sunlight since the photo is taken at night.
