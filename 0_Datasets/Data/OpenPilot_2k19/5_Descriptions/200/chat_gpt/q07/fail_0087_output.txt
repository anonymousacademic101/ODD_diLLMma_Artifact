The image shows overexposure due to the sunlight, which creates glare and causes the sky areas to appear washed out. There is a distinct contrast between the bright areas affected by direct sunlight and the shaded areas, indicating strong light coming into the camera's lens, likely from the sun rather than headlights given the broad daylight context.
