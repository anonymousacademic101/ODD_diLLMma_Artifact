NO

The image shows a daytime scene viewed from inside a vehicle with traffic ahead, and while there is sunlight and some lens flare visible, there are no extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight that would severely impair visibility. The glare present in the photo seems to be mostly from reflections and dirt on the windshield, rather than direct sunlight into the camera or from headlights.
