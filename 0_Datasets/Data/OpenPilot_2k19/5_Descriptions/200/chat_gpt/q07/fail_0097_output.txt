NO.

The image provided does not contain extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight aiming into the camera. Instead, the scene appears evenly lit without harsh lighting or reflections that would suggest the presence of intense light sources such as oncoming vehicle headlights or direct sunlight. The clarity of the view outside the vehicle is indicative of overcast conditions or a well-diffused light situation. There are no strong glares or signs of lens flare that would typically accompany intense light sources in the camera's line of sight.
