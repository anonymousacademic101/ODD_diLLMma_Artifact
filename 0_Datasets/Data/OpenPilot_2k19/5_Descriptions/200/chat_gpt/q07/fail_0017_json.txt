These lights do appear bright, but they are not the extreme bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight into the camera that can cause glare or difficulty seeing. Instead, they are stationary lights that illuminate the area for visibility and safety. There is no indication of oncoming headlights pointing directly at the camera, nor is there any sunlight as the setting is nighttime.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
