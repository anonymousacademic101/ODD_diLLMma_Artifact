However, these lights are not excessively bright or glaring, nor do they resemble the intensity typical of oncoming headlights or direct sunlight. The lighting is typical for a well-lit service station at night and does not overpower the camera's exposure. There is no indication of oncoming headlights facing towards the camera, and it is night time, so there is no sunlight present."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
