The image does not show any extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights, or direct sunlight into the camera. The lighting appears to be relatively even, without any harsh glare or reflections that would suggest strong headlights or direct sunlight affecting the visibility in the image. The sky is visible and seems to be partly cloudy, which also indicates that there isn't direct sunlight overwhelming the shot.
