The image shows glare from various sources of light that appear very bright. These sources include headlights from oncoming vehicles and other lights reflecting off surfaces, creating a visual effect that could be described as "extremely bright" in a relative sense, as they contrast with the darker surroundings. The light sources lead to a glare effect on the photograph. There is no direct sunlight as this appears to be a nighttime scene, but the brightness from the artificial lights is enough to cause significant glare.
