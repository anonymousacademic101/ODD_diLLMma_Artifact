The lights do not appear to be shining directly into the camera, nor is there any direct sunlight, as it is not daytime. The lights are visible but not overwhelming in the scene, suggesting normal night-time driving conditions.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
