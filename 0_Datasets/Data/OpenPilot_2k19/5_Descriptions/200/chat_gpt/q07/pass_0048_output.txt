The image shows a scene taken from inside a vehicle, driving on a highway during the daytime. The sky is clear and blue, indicating that it is a sunny day, and while there may be some level of brightness due to the daylight, there are no signs of any extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight glaring into the camera that would significantly impair visibility or cause discomfort. Hence, any brightness present appears to be typical for a sunny day and does not reach the level of "extremely bright lights" that would be considered hazardous for drivers or problematic in photography.
