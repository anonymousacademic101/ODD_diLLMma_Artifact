The image shows a street scene during what appears to be daytime, with sunlight present but not glaring directly into the camera. There are no headlights from oncoming traffic that are extremely bright or causing significant glare in the camera's view. The scene looks slightly hazy, possibly due to atmospheric conditions, but this does not constitute extreme brightness from lights.
