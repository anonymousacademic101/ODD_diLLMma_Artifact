The image displays a nighttime traffic scene with visible glare from vehicle brake lights and reflections, but there are no exceedingly bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight. It looks like the intense light spots are due to the brake lights of the vehicles ahead, and the reddish glare reflected on the inside of the windshield suggests that the picture was taken from inside a vehicle, capturing the dashboard's reflection. There's no indication of direct sunlight as the sky is dark, pointing to a nighttime setting. Additionally, oncoming headlights don't appear to be directly shining into the camera lens in an overpowering manner.
