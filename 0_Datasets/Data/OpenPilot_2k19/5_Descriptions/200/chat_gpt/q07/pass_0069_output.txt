The ambient light in this image suggests it is twilight or evening, and there is no evidence of extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight into the camera. The headlights and other lights visible are typical of the lighting conditions one would expect in such an environment, and they do not appear to be glaring or excessively bright to the extent that they would impair visibility for the camera or the driver.
