NO

While the image does depict a night-time driving scenario with multiple vehicles' headlights visible, none of the lights shown are producing an extremely bright glare that would significantly impair visibility or be directly shining into the camera lens. The headlight beams appear to be typical in brightness and are not causing lens flare or overpowering the scene's lighting. There is also no direct sunlight since the image is taken at night.
