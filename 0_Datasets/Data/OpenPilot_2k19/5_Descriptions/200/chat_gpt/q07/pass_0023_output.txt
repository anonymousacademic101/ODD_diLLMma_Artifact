The image shows a night scene on a highway with vehicles visible in the distance and in the foreground. While there are headlights from oncoming vehicles on the opposite side of the road, they do not appear to be extremely bright, nor do they cause a glare that would significantly impair visibility. There is no indication of direct sunlight into the camera as it is a nighttime setting. The lighting from the vehicles' headlights appears normal for the conditions, with no excessive brightness or glare detected in the image.
