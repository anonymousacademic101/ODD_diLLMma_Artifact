In the image provided, while there are multiple light sources visible due to oncoming traffic and ambient lights, none of them appear to be extremely bright such that they would cause significant glare or direct sunlight into the camera. The level of brightness seems typical for nighttime driving conditions and does not appear to be overwhelming the camera sensor or resulting in an overexposed image.
