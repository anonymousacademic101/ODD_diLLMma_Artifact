The image appears to be taken during the daytime, and while there is some brightness due to natural daylight, there are no extreme bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight into the camera causing significant glare or overexposure. The lighting seems relatively diffuse, likely due to cloud coverage, and does not show the characteristics of direct sunlight. Additionally, the headlights of any visible cars are not turned on, nor are they facing the camera in a manner that would cause extreme brightness.
