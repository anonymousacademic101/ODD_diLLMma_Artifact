The image displays a road scene captured from within a vehicle, with the road bending to the left and surrounded by foliage. The sky is visible at the top portion of the photo, with some clouds visible and no indication of a direct sunlight source facing the camera. Moreover, there are no other vehicles with headlights on visible in the direction the camera is facing. The lighting conditions appear to be overcast or with the sun positioned in a way that does not introduce glare directly into the lens of the camera.
