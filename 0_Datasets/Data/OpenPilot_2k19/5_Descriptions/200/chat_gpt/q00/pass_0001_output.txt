NO

The image does not display the typical visual characteristics of heavy rain, snow, fog, or other severe weather conditions that would significantly impair visibility. Despite being taken at night, street lights and traffic lights are clearly visible, and the vehicles can be seen without any notable obstructions from adverse weather. There is no evidence of precipitation or fog in the scene. The image may be somewhat grainy or have reflections that are typical of nighttime photography through glass, but these do not indicate poor visibility due to weather.
