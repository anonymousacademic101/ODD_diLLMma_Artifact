The image does not appear to show adverse weather conditions like heavy rain, snow, or fog that would significantly impair visibility. It looks like it's taken during twilight or early evening, so while the natural light is low, artificial lights from the vehicles and infrastructure are clearly visible, and there doesn't seem to be any weather-related obstructions to visibility.
