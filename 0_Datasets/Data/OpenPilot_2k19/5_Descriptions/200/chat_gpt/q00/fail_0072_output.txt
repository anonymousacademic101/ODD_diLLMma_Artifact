While there doesn't appear to be heavy rain, snow, or fog distinctly visible in the image, the overall visibility is poor due to what seems to be a smeared or dirty windshield. This obscures clear viewing, causing a blurry effect that might mimic the visual impact of adverse weather conditions, even if the actual weather outside the vehicle is clear.
