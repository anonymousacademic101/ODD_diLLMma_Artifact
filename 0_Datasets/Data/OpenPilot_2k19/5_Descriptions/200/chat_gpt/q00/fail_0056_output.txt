NO.

The image is clear, and there isn't any heavy rain, snow, fog, or adverse weather conditions visible that would obscure visibility. The scene looks to be a rainy night with wet pavement, as indicated by the reflections of lights, but the rain does not appear to be heavy enough to significantly impair visibility. However, it's important to note that the quality of the image is somewhat poor, with noise and low light, which may affect the clarity of the view. The lack of clear adverse weather conditions in the photo suggests that the visibility is not detrimentally affected by weather in this particular image.
