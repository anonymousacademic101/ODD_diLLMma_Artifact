NO.

The image does not display heavy rain, snow, fog, or severe weather conditions that would significantly reduce visibility. The overall visibility in the image appears to be quite clear; it seems to be a bright day, possibly with sunlight directly facing the camera, which could cause some glare. But this does not constitute poor visibility due to adverse weather conditions.
