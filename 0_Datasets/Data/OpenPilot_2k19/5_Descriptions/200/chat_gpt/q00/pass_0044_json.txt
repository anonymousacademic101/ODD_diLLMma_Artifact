The taillights of vehicles are clear and not distorted by precipitation, and there are no patches of snow or signs of foggy conditions. The image primarily shows darkness due to the time of day it was taken, rather than poor visibility caused by weather.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
