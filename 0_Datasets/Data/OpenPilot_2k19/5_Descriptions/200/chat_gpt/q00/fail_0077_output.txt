NO

The image appears to suffer from a lack of focus or a dirty windscreen rather than poor visibility due to heavy rain, snow, fog, or adverse weather conditions. There are no visible precipitation or fog patterns that typically indicate such weather conditions. The blurriness of the image is more likely due to camera quality or issues with the lens/window through which the photo was taken.
