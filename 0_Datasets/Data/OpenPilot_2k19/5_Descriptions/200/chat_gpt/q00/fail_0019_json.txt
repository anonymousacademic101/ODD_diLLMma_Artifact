This effect is creating light distortions and blurring, which resembles the visual interference typical during rain or when there is water on the camera lens or glass surface being photographed through. However, without further context, it is not possible to definitively attribute the poor visibility to heavy rain, snow, fog, or adverse weather conditions, but the impact on visibility is similar to that caused by such conditions.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
