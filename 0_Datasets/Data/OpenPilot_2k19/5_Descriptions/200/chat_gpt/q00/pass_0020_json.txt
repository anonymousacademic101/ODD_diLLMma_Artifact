The rest of the scene, including the vehicles in front and the building, appear visible without any significant obstruction that would be caused by heavy rain, snow, or fog. The visibility is not poor due to weather conditions; the clarity issue seems localized to the camera's perspective."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
