The image does not show any obvious signs of heavy rain, snow, fog, or adverse weather conditions. The visibility issues in the image appear to be caused by the darkness of the night and the limitations of the vehicleâ€™s headlights to illuminate the road ahead, rather than any adverse weather effects. There are no visible rain streaks, snowflakes, foggy mist, or other indicators of poor weather conditions that would imply reduced visibility due to such factors.
