The image shows a night scene from inside a vehicle with headlights illuminating the road ahead. There is no visible precipitation such as heavy rain or snow, nor is there an obvious presence of fog or other adverse weather conditions that would imply poor visibility. The darkness is due to the time of day rather than weather. Visibility is as expected for nighttime driving conditions with the road ahead clearly visible within the range of the vehicle's headlights.
