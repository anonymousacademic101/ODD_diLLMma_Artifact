The image does not show any signs of heavy rain, snow, fog, or other adverse weather conditions that would significantly impair visibility. The view appears to be clear, with no visible precipitation or fog obscuring the view of the buildings and surrounding area. The apparent fuzziness or blur might be due to the camera's focus or quality rather than weather conditions.
