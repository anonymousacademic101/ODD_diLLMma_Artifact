Instead, the image appears to be taken from inside a vehicle through a wet or dirty windshield at night, which is causing light to scatter and blur significantly. This suggests that the issue with visibility might be primarily due to the condition of the windshield coupled with the camera's exposure to the various light sources at night, rather than the presence of adverse weather conditions."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
