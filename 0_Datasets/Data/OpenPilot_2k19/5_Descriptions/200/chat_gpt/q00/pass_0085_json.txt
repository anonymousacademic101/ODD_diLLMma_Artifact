You can notice that the clarity of objects diminishes as the distance from the camera increases, which is typical in foggy conditions. The outlines of farther objects appear blurred or hazy, and the overall scene has a grey overcast look, both of which are indicators of fog. There is no evident precipitation like rain or snow, but the fog itself is a weather condition that can compromise visibility.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
