The image appears to be taken at night, so the darkness is due to the time of day rather than adverse weather conditions. There aren't any visible signs of heavy rain, snow, fog, or other forms of poor weather conditions affecting visibility; the roadway and other vehicles' lights are clear and there's no indication of precipitation or fog obscuring the view.
