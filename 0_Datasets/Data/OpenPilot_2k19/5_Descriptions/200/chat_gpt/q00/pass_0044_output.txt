NO

The image appears to be taken at night, which naturally results in lower visibility compared to daytime. However, there are no obvious indicators of heavy rain, snow, fog, or adverse weather conditions that are reducing visibility further. The taillights of vehicles are clear and not distorted by precipitation, and there are no patches of snow or signs of foggy conditions. The image primarily shows darkness due to the time of day it was taken, rather than poor visibility caused by weather.
