NO

The visibility in the image does not appear to be significantly impaired by heavy rain, snow, fog, or other severe adverse weather conditions. The sky is overcast, and the overall scene is a bit dim as if it might be an overcast day or near dusk, but there are no visible phenomena such as raindrops, snowflakes, or fog that would notably impair visibility. The road and other vehicles are clearly visible at a reasonable distance.
