NO.

There doesn't appear to be any heavy rain, snow, fog, or adverse weather conditions in the image that are significantly impairing visibility. It seems to be a nighttime scene, which naturally has lower visibility due to the lack of daylight, but the road and other vehicles are still clearly visible in the distance. The lighting conditions are consistent with typical nighttime driving scenarios without additional adverse weather conditions.
