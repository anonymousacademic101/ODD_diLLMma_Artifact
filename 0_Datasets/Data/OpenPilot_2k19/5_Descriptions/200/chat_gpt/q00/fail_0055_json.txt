However, the photo does feature some glare and reflections due to nighttime driving conditions which can slightly reduce visibility. The presence of multiple vehicles with their tail lights on suggests that traffic is moving, although it might be slow-moving or congested. Visibility is likely limited by the nighttime setting itself, but not significantly by adverse weather based on the information available in the image.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
