YES

While there doesn't seem to be heavy rain, snow, or fog in the traditional sense, the visibility in this image is indeed poor. The atmosphere appears hazy or overcast, which results in a decrease in visibility and a gloomy appearance. The specifics of the landscape and the vehicles on the road are not as sharp and clear as they would be on a bright, clear day.
