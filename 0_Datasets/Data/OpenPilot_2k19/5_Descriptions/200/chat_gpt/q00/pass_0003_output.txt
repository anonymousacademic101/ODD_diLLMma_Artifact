YES

The visibility in this image appears to be reduced due to haze or light fog, as the clarity and crispness of distant objects, particularly those further down the highway, are somewhat obscured. There's a noticeable gradient of visibility from the front of the image to the back, indicating some form of atmospheric condition that's affecting how far one can see. Although it might not necessarily classify as "poor" visibility, it's definitely not optimal clear conditions either.
