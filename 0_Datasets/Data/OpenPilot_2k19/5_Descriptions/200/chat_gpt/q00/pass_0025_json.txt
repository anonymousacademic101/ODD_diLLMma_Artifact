Although visibility is naturally reduced due to it being night, there are no signs of heavy fog or other adverse weather conditions obstructing the view of the road ahead. The roadway is clearly visible, marked by the lane lines, and the distant lights suggest a clear atmosphere. The absence of any blurriness or distortion typically associated with poor visibility due to weather conditions like heavy rain, snow, or fog indicates the visibility is reasonable for nighttime driving conditions.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
