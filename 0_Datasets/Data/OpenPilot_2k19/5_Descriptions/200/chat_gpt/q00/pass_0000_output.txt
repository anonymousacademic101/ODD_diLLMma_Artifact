The visibility in the image appears to be impacted, as it seems to be taken at night with some level of darkness surrounding the vehicle, and there are hints of light scatter that could be consistent with fog or mist. This reduced level of natural illumination and potential atmospheric conditions result in poor visibility compared to clear daytime conditions.
