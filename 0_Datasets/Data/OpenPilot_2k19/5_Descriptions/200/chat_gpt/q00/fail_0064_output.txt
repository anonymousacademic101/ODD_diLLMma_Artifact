NO.

The image provided appears to show a parking lot without any active precipitation or fog that would significantly reduce visibility. The cars and environment are visible, and there is daylight present. However, the image quality itself seems poor, with a potential glare and a lack of sharpness, which could be mistaken for poor visibility due to weather, but it's more likely due to the quality of the camera or the settings used when capturing the image.
