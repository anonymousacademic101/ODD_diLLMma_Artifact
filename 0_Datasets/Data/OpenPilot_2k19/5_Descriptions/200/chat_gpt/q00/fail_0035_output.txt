The image appears to have clear visibility with no signs of heavy rain, snow, fog, or adverse weather conditions affecting it. The sky is visible with some cloud cover, but there is no apparent precipitation or obstructions to visibility. The outlines of the cars, road, and surroundings are sharp and well-defined, which would not be the case if visibility were poor due to weather conditions.
