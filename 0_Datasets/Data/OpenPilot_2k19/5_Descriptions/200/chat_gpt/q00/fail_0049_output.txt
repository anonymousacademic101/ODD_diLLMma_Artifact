The image does show signs of poor visibility due to what appears to be a dirty or smeared camera lens or windshield rather than due to adverse weather conditions such as heavy rain, snow, or fog. The scattered light artifacts and lack of clear weather phenomena suggest the issue is with the image capture method rather than the environmental conditions.
