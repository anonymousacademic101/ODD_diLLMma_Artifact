The image visibility is not heavily affected by adverse weather conditions like heavy rain, snow, or thick fog. While the sky appears overcast, which might indicate a cloudy or gloomy day, there isn't any active precipitation or fog dense enough to significantly obscure visibility. The cars and the environment are sufficiently clear, and details are visible without significant impairment.
