The image does not show poor visibility due to heavy rain, snow, fog, or adverse weather conditions. The visibility appears to be reasonably clear. However, there seem to be water droplets on the camera lens or windshield through which the photo was taken, which might give the impression of rain or poor visibility, but the scene itself beyond the droplets is visible.
