The image shows signs of poor visibility but not necessarily due to heavy rain, snow, fog, or adverse weather conditions outdoors. The blur and distortion present seem to come from a dirty or smeared windshield, which is obstructing the clarity of the view from inside a vehicle. The outside environment itself looks clear and free from such weather conditions, but the visibility issue stems from the condition of the vehicle's windshield.
