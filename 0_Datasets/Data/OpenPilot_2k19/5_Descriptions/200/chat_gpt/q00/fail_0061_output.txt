The image appears to be taken on an overcast day with sufficient visibility. The cloud cover may be dense, leading to subdued lighting conditions, but there are no overt signs of heavy rain, snow, fog, or other severe weather conditions that would significantly impair visibility. Objects in the distance, such as the Target store sign and other vehicles in the parking lot, are clearly visible.
