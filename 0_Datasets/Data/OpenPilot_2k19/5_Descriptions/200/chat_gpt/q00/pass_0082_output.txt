NO

The image appears to be taken at night, which naturally reduces visibility due to the absence of daylight; however, there is no visible precipitation like heavy rain, snow, or fog that would additionally impair visibility. The road surface seems dry and clear, and the darkness is the primary reason for reduced visibility, not adverse weather conditions.
