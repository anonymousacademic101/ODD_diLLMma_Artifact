NO

The image appears to have been taken at night with clear visibility on the roadway itself. There are no visible signs of heavy rain, snow, fog, or other adverse weather conditions that would typically affect visibility. The road and other vehicles' lights are clearly visible, indicating that visibility is not significantly impaired. However, darkness is a factor in reducing overall visibility, but this is normal for nighttime driving and not due to adverse weather conditions.
