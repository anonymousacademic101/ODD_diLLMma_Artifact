The image appears to depict a clear day without heavy rain, snow, fog, or other adverse weather conditions that would significantly impair visibility. What might be perceived as a decrease in visibility seems to be due to the angle of the sun and potential glare, rather than any weather conditions. Hence, it does not seem to be a situation of poor visibility due to weather.
