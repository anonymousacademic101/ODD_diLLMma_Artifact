NO

The reason there seems to be poor visibility in this image is likely due to the fact that the photo was taken from inside a vehicle through a dirty or water-spotted windshield, which creates a sense of haziness. However, beyond the apparent dirt or water spots on the glass, the outside weather seems clear without any discernible precipitation or fog. The clarity around the periphery of the windshield and in the parts where there are no spots supports this. The sky appears to be quite bright and lacking any obvious weather-related visibility issues.
