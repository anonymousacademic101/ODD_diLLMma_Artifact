The image shows a dark environment because it appears to be taken at night, which would naturally reduce visibility. However, there are no clear signs of poor visibility due to heavy rain, snow, fog, or adverse weather conditions. The roadway and other vehicles' lights are visible, indicating that the darkness is the main factor reducing visibility, not weather conditions.
