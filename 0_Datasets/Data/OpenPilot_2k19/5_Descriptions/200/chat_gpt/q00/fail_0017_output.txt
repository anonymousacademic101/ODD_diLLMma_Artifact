YES.

The visibility in the image is indeed poor, but the cause seems to be more due to the quality of the photograph rather than actual adverse weather conditions. The image appears to be taken through a dirty or foggy windshield, which obscures clarity, and it is possibly taken at night, which naturally decreases visibility. The haziness does not necessarily indicate heavy rain, snow, or fog; it may simply be an artifact of the camera or the condition of the window through which the photo was taken.
