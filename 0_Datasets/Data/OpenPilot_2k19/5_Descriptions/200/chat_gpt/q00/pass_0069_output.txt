The image seems to be clear without any visible signs of heavy rain, snow, fog, or other adverse weather conditions that would significantly impair visibility. The view of the road and the surroundings is relatively sharp and the tail lights of the vehicles ahead are not diffused, which would indicate the presence of fog or heavy precipitation. Additionally, the sky is visible with what appears to be the moon, suggesting that there is no dense cloud cover associated with poor weather conditions.
