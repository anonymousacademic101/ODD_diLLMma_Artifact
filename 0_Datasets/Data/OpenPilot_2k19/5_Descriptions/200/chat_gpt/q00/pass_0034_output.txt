NO

The image shows a scene with clear skies and good visibility. There is no rain, snow, fog, or other adverse weather conditions that could impair visibility. The road is dry, and the vehicles are clearly visible with no signs of precipitation or mist that would suggest poor visibility. The darkness at the bottom of the image seems to be caused by the car's dashboard and not by any visibility issues outdoors.
