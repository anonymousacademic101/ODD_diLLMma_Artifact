The image does not show any signs of heavy rain, snow, fog, or severe weather conditions that would typically result in poor visibility. The sky is clear, and the surroundings are visible. There are shadows on the ground, indicating the presence of sunlight without any significant obstruction, which suggests good visibility conditions. The apparent blurriness or darkness in the image seems to be due to the cameraâ€™s exposure setting or a dirty windshield, not due to weather conditions.
