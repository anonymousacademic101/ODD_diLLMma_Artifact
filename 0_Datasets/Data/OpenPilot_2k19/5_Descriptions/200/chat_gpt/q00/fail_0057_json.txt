The scene primarily looks like nighttime traffic with artificial lighting from street lights and vehicle headlights and taillights. Visibility appears to be decent within the range of the camera's capture, and no precipitation or fog can be clearly identified in the image provided."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
