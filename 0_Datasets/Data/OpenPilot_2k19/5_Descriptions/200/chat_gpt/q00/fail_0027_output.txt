NO

This image does not appear to show poor visibility specifically caused by heavy rain, snow, fog, or adverse weather conditions. The scene is dark, which suggests it's taken at night, and there is likely some headlight glare on the wet road, but there are no definitive indications of precipitation or fog present in the image you've provided. It is more likely that the image is underexposed, making it difficult to see details clearly.
