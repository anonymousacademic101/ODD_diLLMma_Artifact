Instead, it seems to be a low-light condition either during dawn or dusk. The visibility is reasonably clear as street details, vehicles, and traffic signals are visible without any evident obstruction from weather-related elements. There are no visible signs such as rain streaks, snowflakes, or foggy blurring that would indicate poor weather conditions affecting visibility.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
