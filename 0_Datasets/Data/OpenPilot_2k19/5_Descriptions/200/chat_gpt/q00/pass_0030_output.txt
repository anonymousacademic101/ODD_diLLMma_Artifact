NO

The image does not display signs of heavy rain, snow, fog, or adverse weather conditions that would significantly impair visibility. It seems that the image was taken at night, as it is dark outside, and vehicle lights are visible. The photo may have some blur due to motion or camera shake, but this is distinct from poor visibility due to weather conditions. The road is visible, and distant lights can be seen without signs of weather-related obstruction.
