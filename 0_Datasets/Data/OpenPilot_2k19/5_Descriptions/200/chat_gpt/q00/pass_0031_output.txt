The image does not show any clear signs of heavy rain, snow, fog, or other adverse weather conditions affecting visibility. The blurriness and the glare from lights suggest a low-quality camera or a moving vehicle, rather than poor weather conditions. It appears to be nighttime, and the lit tail lights and street lights are visible without obstructions due to weather.
