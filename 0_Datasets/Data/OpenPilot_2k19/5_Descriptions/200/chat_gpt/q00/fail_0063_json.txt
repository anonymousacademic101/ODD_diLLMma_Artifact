The sky is overcast, which might indicate cloudy weather, but it does not appear to significantly impair visibility. There is no presence of precipitation or fog that is dense enough to reduce visibility to a point where it could be considered poor. The outlines of the vehicles and structures, like the Target store in the background, are clear and distinguishable, suggesting that visibility is reasonably good despite the cloudy skies.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
