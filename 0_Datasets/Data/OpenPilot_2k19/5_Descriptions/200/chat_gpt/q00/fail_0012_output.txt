The visibility in the image is not poor due to heavy rain, snow, fog, or severe weather conditions. Although there are a few water droplets visible on the glass, suggesting there may be some light rain or that the vehicle has recently been through rain, the overall visibility is reasonably clear, and the background is visible without any significant obstruction.
