NO

The image does not exhibit signs of heavy rain, snow, fog, or adverse weather conditions severely affecting visibility. The visibility is relatively clear, and while it is a night scene with some glare from headlights, that doesn't constitute poor visibility due to weather conditions. It might be just a low-light condition, which is typical for night-time driving, and there's no evidence of precipitation or fog that is reducing visibility.
