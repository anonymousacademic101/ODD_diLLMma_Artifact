The image appears clear and free of heavy rain, snow, fog, or severe adverse weather conditions. Visibility seems good, as the outlines of vehicles and the landscape are sharp and the sky is visible and mostly clear of clouds that would suggest inclement weather. What may be confused for reduced visibility is the darkened area across the top portion of the image, which is due to the vehicle's sun visor.
