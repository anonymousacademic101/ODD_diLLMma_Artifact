NO

The image does not appear to have poor visibility due to heavy rain, snow, fog, or adverse weather conditions. Instead, it seems to be a low-light condition either during dawn or dusk. The visibility is reasonably clear as street details, vehicles, and traffic signals are visible without any evident obstruction from weather-related elements. There are no visible signs such as rain streaks, snowflakes, or foggy blurring that would indicate poor weather conditions affecting visibility.
