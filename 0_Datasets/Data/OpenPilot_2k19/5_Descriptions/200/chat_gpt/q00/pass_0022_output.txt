The image does not show poor visibility due to heavy rain, snow, fog, or adverse weather conditions. It appears to be an overcast day, but objects are still clearly visible at a considerable distance, indicating that visibility is not severely impacted. The lack of raindrops on the windshield or snow on the ground, as well as the absence of foggy conditions, supports this observation.
