The image appears to be taken during twilight or early evening, and no overt signs of heavy rain, snow, fog, or adverse weather conditions are visible. The visibility is decent as the road ahead and surrounding vehicles can be seen without any significant obstruction. The image may simply depict a scene with low natural light, and any perceived poor visibility could be attributed to the lower light conditions typical of dawn or dusk rather than adverse weather.
