The image does exhibit poor visibility, but it seems that the poor visibility is not primarily due to heavy rain, snow, fog, or adverse weather conditions. Instead, it appears to be a result of a combination of low light, motion blur, and possible camera quality issues causing the lights and objects to appear smeared or out of focus. There's no visible precipitation or fog that would indicate weather-related visibility issues.
