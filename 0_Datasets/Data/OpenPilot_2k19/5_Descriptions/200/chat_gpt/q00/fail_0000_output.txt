The poor visibility in this image does not appear to be caused by heavy rain, snow, fog, or adverse weather conditions, but rather by low lighting and motion blur, as evidenced by the streaks of light and lack of clarity. It seems to be nighttime or very low-light conditions, and the blur suggests that the image was taken with a slow shutter speed or while the camera was moving, such as in a moving vehicle.
