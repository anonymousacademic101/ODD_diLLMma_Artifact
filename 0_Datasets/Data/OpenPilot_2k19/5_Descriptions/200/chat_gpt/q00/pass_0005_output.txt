The image provided appears to be taken at night from inside a vehicle, with visible light streaks indicating motion. The photo appears relatively clear, but the streaks and blurriness are due to the vehicle's movement and camera exposure during low light conditions rather than adverse weather conditions. Visibility doesn't seem to be significantly affected by weather elements like heavy rain, snow, or fog in the image.
