The lighting conditions appear to be primarily affected by the contrast between the darker underpass and the brighter outside area, which can cause a decrease in visibility due to the transition between different light intensities. However, this is not the result of weather conditions but rather the effect of driving from a darker to a lighter environment.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
