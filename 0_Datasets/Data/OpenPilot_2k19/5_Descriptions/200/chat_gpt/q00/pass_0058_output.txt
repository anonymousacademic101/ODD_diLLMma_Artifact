NO.

The image shows what appears to be a clear night-time scene on a highway with no visible precipitation such as rain or snow, and there is no apparent fog that would severely limit visibility. The traffic ahead is visible, indicated by the tail lights of the vehicles in the distance, and the road lanes are clearly marked and visible. The visibility seems reasonably good for night-time driving conditions.
