Instead, it appears to be a result of a combination of low light, motion blur, and possible camera quality issues causing the lights and objects to appear smeared or out of focus. There's no visible precipitation or fog that would indicate weather-related visibility issues."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
