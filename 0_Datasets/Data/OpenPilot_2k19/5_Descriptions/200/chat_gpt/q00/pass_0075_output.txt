YES

The image shows overcast or cloudy conditions which can sometimes result in lower ambient light, making the visibility poorer than on a clear day. However, there is no clear evidence of heavy rain, snow, or fog at the moment the photo was taken. The visibility in the image is not optimal, likely due to the overcast sky, and it does not depict a typical sunny day with clear conditions.
