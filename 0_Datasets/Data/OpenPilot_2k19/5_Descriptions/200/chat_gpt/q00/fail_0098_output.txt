NO

The image is not showing poor visibility due to heavy rain, snow, fog, or adverse weather conditions. The visibility appears reduced because the photograph seems to have been taken from inside a vehicle with a dirty or obscured windshield, which is causing the blurriness and diminished clarity. The actual weather outside looks clear.
