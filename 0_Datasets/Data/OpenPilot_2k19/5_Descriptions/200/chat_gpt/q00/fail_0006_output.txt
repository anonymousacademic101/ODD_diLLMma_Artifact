NO

The image does not show any obvious signs of poor visibility due to heavy rain, snow, fog, or adverse weather conditions. Instead, the image appears to be somewhat unclear due to the quality of the photo, which could be due to a dirty or foggy windscreen, or low-resolution camera used to capture the image.
