The image appears to be taken during nighttime, but there is no evidence of heavy rain, snow, fog, or other adverse weather conditions that would significantly impair visibility. The streetlights and traffic signals are clear and not obscured by any weather-related phenomena. However, the image does have some level of glare and reflections which are not uncommon in night photography, especially from a vehicle's perspective with dashboard reflections on the windshield.
