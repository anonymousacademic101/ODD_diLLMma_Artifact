YES

The image shows a scene with very low visibility. It is dark, and the only illumination comes from the vehicle's headlights, allowing us to see a limited section of the road ahead. Although the specific cause of the low visibility cannot be explicitly determined from this image alone, the darkness and limited range of the headlights make it difficult to see further into the distance, which can be a common concern during nighttime driving or adverse weather conditions.
