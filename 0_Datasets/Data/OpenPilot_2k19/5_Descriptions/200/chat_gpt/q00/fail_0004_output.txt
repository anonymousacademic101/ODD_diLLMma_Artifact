NO.

The image provided does not show poor visibility due to heavy rain, snow, fog, or adverse weather conditions. All objects in the scene are visible, and there are no signs of precipitation or fog that would significantly impair visibility. The sky appears clear, and there is sufficient natural light to see the surroundings. There is, however, a slight blur, possibly due to the camera's focus or a dirty windshield, but this does not equate to poor weather conditions affecting visibility.
