While there is a gentle curve in the distance, the road does not appear to be characterized by tight and frequent bends that would classify it as winding. The curvature visible here does not indicate a sharp or serpentine path typical of a winding road.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
