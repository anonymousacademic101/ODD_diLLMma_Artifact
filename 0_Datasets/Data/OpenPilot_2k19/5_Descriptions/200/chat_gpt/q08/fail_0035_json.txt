It is a straight section of a road with adequate width to accommodate several vehicles side by side, as evidenced by the cars waiting at what appears to be a traffic light or intersection. "Narrow" would indicate a smaller width that might only allow for one-way traffic or very tight two-way traffic. "Winding" would suggest multiple curves or a serpentine-like path, which is not visible in this image.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
