NO.

The road shown in the image appears to be a wide multi-lane road with visible traffic signals and no immediate indications of it being narrow or winding. The lanes are clearly marked, and it seems to be a straight roadway at the section visible in the image. The setting does not match the description of a narrow and winding road, which typically would have less space and more curves.
