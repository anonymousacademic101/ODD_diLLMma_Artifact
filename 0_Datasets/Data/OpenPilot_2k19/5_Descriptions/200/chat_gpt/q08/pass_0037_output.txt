NO.

The road shown in the image appears to be a multi-lane highway that is fairly straight in the visible stretch, with no indications of it being narrow or winding. This can be inferred from the lane markings, the distance the headlight beams reach before curving out of view, and the lack of any sharp bends or narrow points in the roadway within the visible area.
