There are multiple lanes as indicated by the presence of the vehicle directly ahead and the lanes that appear to be to the right of it. Additionally, the cars are stopped, suggesting a traffic situation rather than a winding road where vehicles would typically be in motion and the path would curve in and out of view. The road seems fairly straight in the section visible.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
