NO.

The road in the image has multiple lanes and appears to be equipped with standard road infrastructure such as traffic islands and lights, which suggests it is a main thoroughfare or a street in an urban or suburban area rather than a narrow, winding road typically found in rural or less developed areas. The presence of other vehicles and the visible lane markings support this observation. The road may have a curve, but there is not enough context to classify it as winding in the sense of having multiple sharp bends.
