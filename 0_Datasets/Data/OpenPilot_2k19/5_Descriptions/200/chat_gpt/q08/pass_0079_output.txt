The road in the image appears to be a multi-lane highway with relatively straight lanes and wide shoulders, rather than a narrow, winding road. The lanes are well-defined, it is daylight, and the driving conditions seem clear. There are multiple cars on the road, suggesting that it is relatively wide to accommodate such traffic.
