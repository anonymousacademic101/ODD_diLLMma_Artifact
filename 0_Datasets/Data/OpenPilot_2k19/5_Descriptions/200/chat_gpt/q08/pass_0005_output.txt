NO.

The road in the image appears to be a multi-lane highway with multiple lanes for each direction of traffic, separated by a median. It does not look particularly narrow, and in the segment visible, it does not show sharp turns that would classify it as winding. Instead, the road seems to be relatively straight with gentle curves typical of highways designed for higher speed travel.
