NO.

The road in the image appears to be a multi-lane highway, which typically indicates that it is not narrow. The lanes are well-marked, and there is visible traffic signage, suggesting it is designed for higher-speed traffic, which typically requires wider lanes for safety. The image shows a straight section of the road ahead, not a winding path. Winding roads often have curves that are immediate and close together, often with warning signs or reduced speed limits to accommodate for the changes in direction, which are not visible in this image.
