NO.

The image provided is not of a road; it is a view from inside a vehicle that is in a drive-thru lane of a fast-food restaurant, specifically McDonald's. The "Order Here" signs, the menu board, and the presence of other vehicles waiting in line to place orders indicate that this is not a public road, but rather a customer service area designed for vehicles to queue and order food. It is neither narrow nor winding in the sense that a road might be, as those terms would usually refer to the physical characteristics of a roadway, not a commercial drive-thru lane.
