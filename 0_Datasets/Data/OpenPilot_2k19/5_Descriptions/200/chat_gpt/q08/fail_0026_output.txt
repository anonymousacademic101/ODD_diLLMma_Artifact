The road appears to be winding because the headlight beams show that the path ahead curves to the right, and no additional lanes are visible, which suggests that it is narrow. The guardrail implies a turn and the fact that only a limited portion of the road can be seen further supports it being winding. However, the darkness and the limited view from the headlights could obscure additional details.
