The road in the image is not narrow and winding; it appears to be a broad, multi-lane urban street with clear lane markings and traffic signals. It looks straight in the section visible in the image, suggesting that it is a typical city road designed for steady traffic flow rather than a narrow, winding road which would have curves and possibly less space per lane.
