The road in the image appears to be a multi-lane highway with wide lanes, clear markings, and gentle curves rather than a narrow and winding road. It does not exhibit the characteristics typical of roads described as "narrow and winding," which usually means a road that is tight, with sharp turns and possibly limited visibility. In contrast, the road seen here allows for higher speeds and smooth vehicle flow.
