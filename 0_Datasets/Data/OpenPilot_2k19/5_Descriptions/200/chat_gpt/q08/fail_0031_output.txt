NO.

The road shown in the image appears to be a multi-lane road with clearly marked lanes and sufficient width. It does not appear to be particularly narrow or winding based on the visible stretch. The immediate road ahead seems straight, and there are multiple lanes accommodating traffic in one direction, which indicates that it's a broader road designed for smooth traffic flow rather than a narrow, winding one.
