The road on which we are driving does not appear to be narrow and winding. It actually looks to be a multi-lane highway with straight sections visible in the image provided. There are multiple lanes marked by clear lane lines, and the absence of sharp bends or curves in the visible stretch of road suggests that it is not winding. Additionally, the wide separation between opposite lanes of traffic indicates that the road is indeed not narrow.
