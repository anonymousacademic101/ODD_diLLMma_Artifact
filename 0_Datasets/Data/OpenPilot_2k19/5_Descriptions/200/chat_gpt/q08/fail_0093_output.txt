NO

The road in the image does not appear to be particularly narrow; it seems to have enough width for two lanes. Also, while there is a curve visible in the road, the extent of its winding nature cannot be fully determined from this single image. A road would typically be considered "winding" if there are multiple sharp turns or frequent changes in direction, which cannot be conclusively seen here.
