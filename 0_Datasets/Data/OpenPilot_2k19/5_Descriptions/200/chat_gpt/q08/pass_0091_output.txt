NO.

The road shown in the image appears to be a multi-lane urban road with clear lane markings and traffic signals. It does not present the characteristics of a narrow, winding road, which would typically involve single-lane traffic, limited visibility around bends, and a lack of urban infrastructure, such as traffic lights and crosswalks. This road, by contrast, has multiple lanes in each direction and controlled intersections, indicative of an urban or suburban environment designed to handle higher volumes of traffic.
