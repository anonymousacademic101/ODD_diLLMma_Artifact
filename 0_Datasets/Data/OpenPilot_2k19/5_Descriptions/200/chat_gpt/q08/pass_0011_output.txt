NO.

The road in the image appears to be a wide multi-lane highway with relatively straight sections visible in the frame. There are multiple lanes for traffic in both directions, which is not characteristic of a narrow and winding road. Such roads are typically more constrained and have tighter turns or bends, which are not observed here.
