The image shows a road at night with multiple lanes and clear lane markings, suggesting that the road is not narrow. Additionally, the section visible in the image does not show any signs of curves or turns that would indicate it is winding. Instead, the road appears to be relatively straight as far as the headlights allow us to see.
