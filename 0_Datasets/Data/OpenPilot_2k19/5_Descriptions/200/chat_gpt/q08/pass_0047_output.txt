The road in the image is not narrow and winding. It appears to be a multi-lane urban road with clear lane markings, and it is quite straight in the section visible in the image. There are multiple lanes for traffic in each direction, suggesting it is a road designed to accommodate a significant volume of traffic, which is typical of wider, more direct urban roadways rather than narrow, winding ones.
