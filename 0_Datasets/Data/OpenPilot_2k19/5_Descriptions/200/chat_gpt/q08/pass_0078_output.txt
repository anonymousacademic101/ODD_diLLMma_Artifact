The road in the image appears to be a multi-lane highway with markings for separate lanes, suggesting that it is not narrow. There are no visible sharp turns or bends in the section of the road visible in the picture, indicating that it is not winding either. The road seems to be designed for relatively high-speed travel and is wide enough to accommodate multiple vehicles side by side comfortably.
