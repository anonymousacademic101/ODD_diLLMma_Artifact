The road appears to be a multi-lane highway with several lanes of traffic in either direction, evidenced by the multiple vehicles visible in the image. Such roads are usually designed to accommodate a high volume of traffic and are not typically described as narrow or winding. The road seems relatively straight in the visible portion, and the lanes are of standard width for highways, which would not qualify as "narrow" in the context of roadway descriptions.
