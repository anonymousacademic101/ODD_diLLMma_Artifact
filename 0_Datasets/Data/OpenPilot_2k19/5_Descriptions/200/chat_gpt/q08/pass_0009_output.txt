NO.

The road in the image is neither narrow nor winding. It appears to be a wide, multilane highway with traffic lanes that are clearly marked and relatively straight in the visible portion of the photograph. The image shows ample space between lanes, and there is no evident curvature in the road that would suggest it is winding.
