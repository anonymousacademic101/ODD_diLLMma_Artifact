Additionally, the straight road segment visible in the image does not show any signs of tight bends or curves that would classify it as winding. The traffic signal and other roadside infrastructure also indicate a more urban or suburban setting, where roads tend to be wider and straighter to accommodate traffic flow.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
