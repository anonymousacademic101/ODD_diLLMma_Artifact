NO.

The road in the image appears to be a multi-lane highway with relatively straight lanes as seen by the lane markings that extend into the distance without any noticeable curves. There is ample space between the lanes, and the photo does not indicate any sharp turns or winding paths. The absence of twists and the presence of multiple lanes suggest that the road is neither narrow nor winding.
