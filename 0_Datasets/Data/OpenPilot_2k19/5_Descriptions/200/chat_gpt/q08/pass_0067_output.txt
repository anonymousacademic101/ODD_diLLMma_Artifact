NO.

The photo suggests that we are in a parking lot near a store (Target), not on a narrow and winding road. The surroundings indicate a wide-open space that is typical for parking areas near large retail outlets. The environment lacks the characteristics of a roadway, such as lane markers or roadside signage that would indicate a narrow or winding road. Instead, we can see parked cars and a relatively flat surface designed for parking.
