The road in the image appears to be a multi-lane highway with straight sections and gentle curves that allow for relatively high-speed travel, which is not characteristic of roads described as narrow and winding. These types of highways are designed to facilitate the smooth flow of traffic and typically have broader lanes and soft curves for better vehicle stability at speed.
