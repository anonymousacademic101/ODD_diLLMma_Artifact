The road in the image appears to be a wide multi-lane highway with straight sections and clear lane markings, not a narrow or winding road. The lanes are well-defined and there appears to be ample space for vehicles to travel side by side, which is not characteristic of narrow and winding roads that typically have limited space and frequent turns or curves.
