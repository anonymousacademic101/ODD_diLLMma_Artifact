NO.

From the image provided, it's not possible to definitively determine whether the road ahead is narrow and winding. The image shows a nighttime scene with limited visibility. There appears to be a turn in the road just ahead, indicated by the visible road signs and direction of the road's edges illuminated by the headlights, but the extent of the road's curvature beyond this turn or its overall narrowness cannot be assessed with certainty from this single still image. To accurately categorize the road as narrow and winding would require more visual information or knowledge about the road beyond this immediate view.
