The road in the image is not narrow and winding; it appears to be a multi-lane road in an urban environment with vehicles queued, suggesting traffic congestion or a traffic signal ahead. The lanes are clearly marked, and it does not show any signs of being narrow or having sharp bends that would characterize it as winding.
