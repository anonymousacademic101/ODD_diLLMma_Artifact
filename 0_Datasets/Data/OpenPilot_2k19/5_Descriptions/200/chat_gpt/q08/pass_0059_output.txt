NO.

The road in the image is not narrow and winding; it is a wide, multi-lane highway with clear lane markings and a relatively straight path visible in the photo. There are multiple lanes for traffic in both directions, and the road appears to be designed to accommodate a high volume of vehicles, which is characteristic of highways rather than narrow, winding roads.
