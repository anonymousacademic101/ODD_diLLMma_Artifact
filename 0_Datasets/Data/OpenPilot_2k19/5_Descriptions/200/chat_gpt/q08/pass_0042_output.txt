NO.

The road in the image appears to be a multi-lane road with moderate traffic. It does not show any signs of being particularly narrow or winding; instead, it seems to be a straight section of a highway or an arterial road with clear lane markings. Each lane is wide enough to accommodate standard vehicles comfortably, which is typical of highways and not characteristic of narrow, winding roads.
