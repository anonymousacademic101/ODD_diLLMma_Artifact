NO.

Based on the image provided, the road ahead appears to be straight rather than winding, and it does not look particularly narrow. The road seems to be a standard multi-lane roadway, possibly a highway, with lanes that are typical in width for such a road. There is an overpass ahead, and from what is visible, there is no indication of sharp curves or narrow lanes that would characterize the road as narrow and winding.
