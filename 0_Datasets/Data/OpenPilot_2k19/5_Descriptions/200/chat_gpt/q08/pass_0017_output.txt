NO

The road shown in the image does not appear to be narrow and winding. It looks like a straight urban street with wide lanes, clear demarcations, and space for parking on the side, typical of many city roads. The situation depicted is likely a traffic stop or a pause in movement, not a feature of a narrow or winding path.
