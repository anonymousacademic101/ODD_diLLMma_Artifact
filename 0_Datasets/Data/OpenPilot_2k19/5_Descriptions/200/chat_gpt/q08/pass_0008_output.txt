The road depicted in the image appears to be a multi-lane highway rather than narrow. The lanes are clearly marked and wide, leading straight into the distance, with multiple vehicles seen traveling along it. Also, the road does not show any immediate winding or sharp turns in the visible portion of the image. Instead, it looks like a typically straight section of a highway or major road suitable for high-speed travel, common in urban or suburban areas.
