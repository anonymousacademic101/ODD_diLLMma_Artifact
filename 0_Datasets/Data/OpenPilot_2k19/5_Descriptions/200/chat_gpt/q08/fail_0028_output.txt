YES

The road ahead appears to be curving to the left, as indicated by the road sign that shows a sharp turn or curve in that direction. Although we cannot assess the full width of the road from this image, the presence of the warning sign suggests caution is advised, often due to the road being winding. However, without a clearer view of more of the road, it is not possible to definitively determine the overall narrowness or the extent of the winding nature of this road beyond this curve.
