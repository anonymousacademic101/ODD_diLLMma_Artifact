The road in the image appears to be neither narrow nor winding. It looks like a typical city street that is straight and wide enough to accommodate multiple lanes of traffic, as indicated by the visible lane markings and the cars parked and driving in opposite directions. There are also traffic signals and crosswalks, which are common features of urban roads, suggesting that the road is designed to handle a regular flow of vehicular and pedestrian traffic.
