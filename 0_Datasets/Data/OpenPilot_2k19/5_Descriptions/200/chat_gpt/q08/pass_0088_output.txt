NO

The road in the image appears to be a wide highway with multiple lanes and gentle curves, rather than being narrow and winding. The lanes are clearly marked, the road is well-maintained, and there is a barrier on the side, all of which suggest it is designed to accommodate high-speed vehicular traffic efficiently. It does not exhibit the characteristics of a narrow, winding road such as tight turns, limited visibility, or a single lane of travel.
