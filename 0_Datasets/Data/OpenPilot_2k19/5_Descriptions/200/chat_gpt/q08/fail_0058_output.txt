NO.

The road in the image appears to be a standard city street with multiple lanes, marked pedestrian crossings, and traffic lights, which are typical features of a wider, urban roadway rather than a narrow and winding road. There are no evident sharp bends or tight turns that would characterize it as winding. Additionally, there is visible infrastructure around the road including buildings and streetlights, suggesting an urban rather than a rural setting where narrow and winding roads are more commonly found.
