NO

The "road" shown in the image is not an actual road but appears to be a drive-thru lane for a fast-food restaurant, as indicated by the arrow on the ground directing vehicles, the proximity of the building to the lane, and the car in front which seems to be in line for service. A drive-thru lane is typically straightforward and follows the perimeter of the restaurant; it is not designed to be narrow and winding in the same sense as a road might be.
