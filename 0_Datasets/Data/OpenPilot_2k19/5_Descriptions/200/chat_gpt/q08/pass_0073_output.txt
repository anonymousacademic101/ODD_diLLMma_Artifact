The road depicted in the image is not narrow and winding; rather, it appears to be a multi-lane highway with relatively straight segments visible in the picture. The road has several lanes in both directions, suggesting that it is built to accommodate a high volume of traffic, which is characteristic of highways rather than narrow, winding roads.
