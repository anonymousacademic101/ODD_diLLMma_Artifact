The view outside appears to show multiple lanes with vehicles spaced out, which suggests a relatively wide road. Additionally, the visible stretch of the road in the image seems rather straight, without visible sharp bends or curves that would categorize it as winding. The setting does not appear to correspond with a narrow, winding road; instead, it looks like a typical urban or suburban road with sufficient width to accommodate multiple lanes of traffic and designed for straightforward navigation.
