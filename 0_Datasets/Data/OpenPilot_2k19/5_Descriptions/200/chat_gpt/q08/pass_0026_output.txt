NO.

The road shown in the image appears to be a wide, multi-lane highway with clear lane markings. There are no visible sharp turns or bends that would classify the road as winding, and the lanes are wide enough to suggest that it is not narrow. This looks like a typical highway or motorway designed to accommodate high-speed vehicular traffic with multiple lanes for each direction, which is not characteristic of narrow and winding roads.
