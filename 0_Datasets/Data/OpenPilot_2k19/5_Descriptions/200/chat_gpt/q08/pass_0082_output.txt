The road in the image appears to be broad with multiple lanes and the flow of traffic is straight in the visible stretch, without any immediate tight turns or curves that would categorize it as winding. The visibility is limited by darkness, but from what can be seen, the road does not show the characteristics of being narrow or winding.
