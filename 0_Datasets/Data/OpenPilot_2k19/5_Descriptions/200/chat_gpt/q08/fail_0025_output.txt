NO.

The image's quality and lighting conditions are poor, making it difficult to accurately assess the width and curvature of the road. From what is visible, the road ahead appears to bend slightly to the right, but there is not enough visual information to determine if the road is consistently winding or just has a single bend, nor is there enough context to ascertain the actual width of the road. The image itself does not provide conclusive evidence to describe the road as narrow and winding.
