Based on the image provided, you are not driving on a road but appear to be in a drive-thru lane of a fast-food restaurant. This is indicated by the presence of a menu and service window adjacent to the car ahead, as well as the building's architecture typically associated with drive-thru lanes. Drive-thru lanes are not designated as roads, and they are not characterized by the typical winding and narrow features of certain roads; instead, they are designed to facilitate the flow of vehicles waiting to order or pick up food from a restaurant.
