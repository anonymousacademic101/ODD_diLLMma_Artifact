NO

The road depicted in the image does not appear to be narrow or winding. It looks to be a typical multi-lane roadway with clear lane markings and a straightforward path, at least in the section visible in the photo. There are no signs of any tight curves or narrow passages immediately ahead, and the road seems to be leading to a traffic light at an intersection.
