The road in the image appears to be a multi-lane highway with several lanes of traffic visible. It isn't narrow as there are multiple lanes accommodating many vehicles side by side. There isn't any visible sharp curvature that would make it winding within the scope of the image; it appears to be relatively straight where the photograph was captured. The conditions suggest a typical highway or freeway scenario rather than a narrow, winding road.
