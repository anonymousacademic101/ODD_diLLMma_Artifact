The road appears to be a multi-lane highway with relatively straight paths visible in the distance, and there are no immediate signs of winding turns from the perspective of the image. The lanes are also fairly wide, which is typical for highways, as opposed to a narrow, winding road which would have tighter lanes and more curves.
