The road is relatively straight in the visible section with a sightline extending into the distance, and there are no tight turns or bends visible that would classify it as winding. The presence of visible lane markings and the absence of any sharp bends indicate this road is not narrow or winding in the section shown.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
