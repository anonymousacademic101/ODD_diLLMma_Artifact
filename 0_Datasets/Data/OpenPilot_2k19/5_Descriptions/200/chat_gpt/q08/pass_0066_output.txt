The road in the image is not narrow and winding; rather, it appears to be a multi-lane highway, which typically has wider lanes and may have gentle curves but not the sharp turns usually associated with winding roads. The visibility of multiple lanes, highway signage, and the straight path seen in the image indicate it is a standard highway.
