The road ahead does not appear to be narrow and winding. It looks like a standard suburban road with multiple lanes and clear lane markings, suggesting that it is built to accommodate regular traffic flow without the constraints that would be associated with a narrow and winding road. The road also appears to be straight as far as can be seen in the image, without any immediate bends or twists indicating a winding path.
