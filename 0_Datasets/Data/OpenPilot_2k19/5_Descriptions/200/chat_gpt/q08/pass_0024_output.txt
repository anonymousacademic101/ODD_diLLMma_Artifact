The road in the image appears to be a multi-lane highway with several lanes in both directions. It does not look narrow as it has multiple lanes that accommodate a significant amount of traffic side by side. Additionally, from what we can see in the image, the road is straight in the visible stretch, without any evident sharp turns or winding paths.
