The road in the image is not narrow and winding; it appears to be a multi-lane highway with relatively straight sections visible in the immediate view. There are multiple lanes for both directions of travel, separated by a median, which suggests it is designed for higher-speed travel and not the characteristics of a narrow, winding road.
