NO

The road shown in the image runs horizontally across the image. It does not appear to be an intersection; rather, it is a stretch of multi-lane highway with vehicles traveling in both directions, separated by a median. The lanes on the side we are on are heading in the same direction, indicating it is a standard highway or freeway scenario rather than an intersection, where multiple roads would intersect and vehicles would have the options to turn or cross paths.
