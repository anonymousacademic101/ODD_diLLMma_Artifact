The road does not run horizontally across the image; instead, it appears to be a parking lot aisle. The vehicles are parked on either side, indicating that the driving lane is for traffic moving along the length of the parking spaces, which is generally perpendicular to how horizontal roads are depicted. Additionally, there is a "Target" store in the background, typically found adjacent to parking lots rather than alongside horizontal roads.
