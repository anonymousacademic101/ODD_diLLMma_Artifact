NO.

The road shown in the image appears to run horizontally across the image from the perspective of the camera. It does not seem to be an intersection as there are no visible cross streets, traffic lights indicating a crossing, or signs that would typically mark an intersection. Instead, the road continues straight into the distance with lane markings visible, indicating it is a straight path rather than an intersection.
