YES

The road displayed in the image appears to be an intersection. This is indicated by the presence of a stop sign on the right side, the "STOP" marking painted on the road in the foreground, and the layout of the road and curb which suggests the presence of a junction where two or more roads intersect. The horizontal orientation across the image is likely due to the angle of the view from the vehicle, which is positioned at or near the stop line, preparing to enter or cross the intersection.
