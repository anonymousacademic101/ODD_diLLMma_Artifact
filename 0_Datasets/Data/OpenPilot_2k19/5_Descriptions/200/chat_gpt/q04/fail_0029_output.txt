NO

The road in the image does not run horizontally across the image; rather, it appears we are approaching an intersection where there's a curve to the left, as indicated by the road sign showing a left turn with a recommended speed of 15 mph. The way the road bends and the presence of the sign suggest we must make a decision to either stay on the current road by turning left or possibly turning onto another path if available.
