The image appears to show a vehicle that is in a drive-through lane next to a building, which suggests that the path we are on is part of a drive-through service route rather than a standard road intersection or a road running horizontally across the image. The direction of travel is towards the service window of the establishment, which typically follows a linear path adjacent to the building rather than crossing horizontally.
