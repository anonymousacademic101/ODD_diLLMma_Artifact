There is no indication of an intersection directly in view; rather, it seems to be a section of a highway or similar road with multiple lanes, traveling through a rural or semi-rural area with trees and a clear sky. The lanes are marked, suggesting regulated traffic flow in one direction. An intersection typically includes cross traffic and accompanying traffic control devices, none of which are visible in this image."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
