The road does not run horizontally across the image. It appears that we are at an intersection where another road meets the one we are on, potentially forming a T-junction. The horizontal aspect that might suggest a road running across the image is actually the other road joining the road we are on. There are visible markers and curbs indicating the meeting of two roads.
