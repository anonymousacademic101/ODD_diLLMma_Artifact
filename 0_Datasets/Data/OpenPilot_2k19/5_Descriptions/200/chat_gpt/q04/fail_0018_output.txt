YES

The image shows a road that appears to be part of an intersection. The lanes are marked for turning, with one vehicle in front positioned to turn left, indicated by the visible curved lane lines and the traffic island to the right. The existence of multiple lanes with different directions, and the layout of the road markings, suggest this is an intersection rather than a road running horizontally across the image.
