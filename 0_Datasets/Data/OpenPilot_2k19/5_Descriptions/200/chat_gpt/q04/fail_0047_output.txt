The image shows a road that runs horizontally across the frame from the perspective of the camera. The positioning of vehicles at a perpendicular angle to the direction the camera is facing, the visible traffic lights, and the general layout suggests we are looking at an intersection, but from the perspective of the camera, the road we are on runs horizontally across the image.
