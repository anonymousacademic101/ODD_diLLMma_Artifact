NO.

The road does not appear to be an intersection, nor does it run horizontally across the image. Instead, it looks like we are in a drive-thru lane at a fast-food restaurant, which typically curves around the building. The vehicle ahead is stopped, likely waiting to move forward in the line to either place an order or reach the pick-up window. The visible parts of the building and the presence of menu boards or service windows typically found in such settings support this observation.
