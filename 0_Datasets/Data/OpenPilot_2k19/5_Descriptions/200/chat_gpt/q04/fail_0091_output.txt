YES

The road we are driving on appears to be part of an intersection. The image shows a point where our path converges with another road that runs horizontally across it. There's a visible white vehicle approaching from the driver's right-hand side, which implies cross traffic and supports the notion of an intersection. Additionally, there seem to be road markings indicating the presence of an intersection.
