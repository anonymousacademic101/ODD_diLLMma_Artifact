YES

The road we are driving on runs horizontally across the image. This determination can be made because the vehicles are arranged in parallel lines, typical of lanes on a road, which implies a horizontal layout within the context of the image's perspective. Additionally, the image shows a traffic light ahead, with cars stopped at the intersection, indicating that the road extends horizontally from the viewpoint of the driver (or photographer).
