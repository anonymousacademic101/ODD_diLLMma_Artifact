The road seen through the windshield features both an intersection where a decision can be made to turn, indicated by arrows on the pavement, and the road also runs horizontally across the image, as seen by the continuity of the pavement and the position of the red traffic lights ahead. This suggests the driver is approaching an intersection where they have the option to go straight or turn.
