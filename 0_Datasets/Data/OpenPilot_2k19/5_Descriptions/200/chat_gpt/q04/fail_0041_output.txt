YES

The road runs horizontally across the image from the perspective of the camera. There are traffic signals ahead and a vehicle is seen on the right side of the image, indicating that the road extends horizontally in front of the viewer. Additionally, the road markings and the orientation of the vehicles suggest that this road is not part of an intersection that the camera is directly approaching. However, it appears to be close to an intersection since there are traffic lights and multiple entry/exit points, with a ramp overhead suggesting proximity to a highway or interchange.
