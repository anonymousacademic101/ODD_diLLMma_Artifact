YES

The road appears to run horizontally across the image rather than being an intersection. There is no clear evidence of cross traffic or road intersections, but instead, there seems to be a continuous stretch of road extending from the bottom to the top of the image. The road lines give the impression of a straight pathway rather than intersecting routes.
