NO.

The road we are driving on does not appear to be an intersection, nor does it run horizontally across the image. Instead, the road stretches away vertically from the perspective of the camera position, heading straight into the distance. The lanes and the direction of the vehicles suggest a straightforward roadway rather than a crossroad or intersection.
