NO

The road depicted in the image runs vertically from the bottom to the top of the image, following the perspective of the car's movement towards the lights in the distance. There is no visible intersection running horizontally across the image; instead, the road appears to extend into the distance, suggesting continuous travel in the same direction rather than a crossing path. The lanes and traffic also indicate a straight path rather than an intersection.
