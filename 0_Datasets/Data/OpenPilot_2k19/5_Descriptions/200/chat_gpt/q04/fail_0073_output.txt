YES

The road seen through the windshield appears to be at an intersection. There are traffic signals directly ahead, which are green, indicating the possibility of proceeding straight or making a turn. There is also a perpendicular street sign for "Arch St," which suggests that the road being driven on intersects with Arch Street. Additionally, lines and crosswalk markings on the pavement are visible, which are common features where two roads intersect.
