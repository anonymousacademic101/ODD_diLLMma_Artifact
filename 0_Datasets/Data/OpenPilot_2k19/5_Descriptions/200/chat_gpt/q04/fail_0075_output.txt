The road runs horizontally across the image. You can tell because of the orientation of the yellow hash markings and lines on the road which are typically used to demarcate opposing traffic lanes, indicating that the road extends left and right across the frame. Additionally, the traffic light visible at the right of the image is facing towards us, which would control traffic moving parallel to our point of view, reinforcing that the road runs horizontally in the image.
