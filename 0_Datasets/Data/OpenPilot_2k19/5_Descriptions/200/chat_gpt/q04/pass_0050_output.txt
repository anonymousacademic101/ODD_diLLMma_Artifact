NO.

The reason is that we are looking at a straight stretch of road that runs horizontally across the image from the perspective of the camera. An intersection typically involves two or more roads crossing or meeting at a point, which is not depicted here. Instead, we see multiple lanes of traffic moving parallel to each other, characteristic of a highway or multi-lane road rather than an intersection.
