YES

The road runs horizontally across the image. The reason for this assessment is that the vehicles are aligned in a straight line from the left to the right side of the image, indicating that the direction of the road is horizontal in the frame of the photo. Moreover, the lanes and the positioning of roadside elements like trees and signs suggest a horizontally oriented roadway. There are no visible indications of an intersection within the immediate view of the camera.
