The road runs horizontally across the image. It appears to be a multi-lane highway or freeway with traffic moving in parallel lines and no intersecting traffic visible, which is typical for highways rather than intersections. The presence of road signs overhead further supports the observation that it is a section of a highway rather than an intersection.
