YES

The road runs horizontally across the image, from the perspective of the viewpoint presented in the image. We can tell this because we see the lanes of the road and the vehicles on it extending from the bottom of the image towards the horizon, indicating that the road we are driving on is indeed laid out horizontally in the image frame. There is no visual evidence in this image that suggests we are at an intersection.
