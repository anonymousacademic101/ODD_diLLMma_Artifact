NO

The road does not run horizontally across the image. The perspective shown in the image indicates we are driving forward, following the car ahead in what appears to be a drive-thru lane or a narrow service road, rather than being at an intersection or having a road that runs horizontally across the field of view. An intersection or a horizontally running road would present a different view, typically showing crossing traffic or a wider view of intersecting pathways.
