YES

The road visible in the image includes an intersection. The presence of crosswalks, traffic lights facing multiple directions, and the positioning of lanes with vehicles oriented both perpendicular and parallel to the viewer's perspective are clear indicators of an intersection. The street the viewer is on also appears to continue horizontally across the image, indicated by the visible lane markings continuing straight ahead.
