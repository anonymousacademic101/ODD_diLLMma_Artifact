NO

The road you are driving on does not appear to be an intersection. It runs horizontally across the image, as seen by the direction of the guardrail and the visible path of the road illuminated by the vehicle's headlights. The guardrail is parallel to the vehicle's direction of travel and indicates the edge of the road, suggesting that the road continues straight rather than intersecting with another road at this point.
