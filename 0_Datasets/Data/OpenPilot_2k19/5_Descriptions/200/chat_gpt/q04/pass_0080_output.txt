NO

The road does not appear to be either an intersection or running horizontally across the image. Based on the context provided by the image, it seems we're looking at a parking lot rather than a road. Cars are parked at various angles, consistent with a parking lot layout, and there's a clear view of a storefront (In-N-Out) which is a typical feature of a parking lot environment.
