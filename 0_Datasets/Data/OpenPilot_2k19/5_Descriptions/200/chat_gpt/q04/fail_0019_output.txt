YES

The road appears to run horizontally across the image, as we can infer from the layout of the lanes, traffic lights, and the positioning of the vehicles which are aligned perpendicular to the vantage point of the camera. The horizontal road suggests that the image captures a part of an intersection where the road we are approaching intersects with another. The traffic light showing red for the viewer's direction further implies that we are at an intersection, waiting for our turn to cross or merge onto the intersecting road.
