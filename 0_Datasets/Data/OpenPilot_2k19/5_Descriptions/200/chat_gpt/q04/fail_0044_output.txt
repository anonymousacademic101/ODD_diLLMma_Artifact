YES

The image shows a road that runs horizontally across the field of view. This can be inferred because the parked cars are aligned perpendicularly to the viewer's perspective, indicating that they are parked along the side of a road that extends horizontally in the image. An intersection would typically show roads that either converge or cross, and there is no such visual evidence in this image.
