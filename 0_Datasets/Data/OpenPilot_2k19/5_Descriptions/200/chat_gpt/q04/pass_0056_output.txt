YES

The road runs horizontally across the image. The photo is taken from inside a vehicle on a road with multiple lanes of traffic running parallel to the bottom edge of the image, which indicates a horizontal orientation relative to the perspective of the image. There are no visible signs of an intersection directly ahead where paths would cross each other, and the traffic flow appears to be in a straight, horizontal line across the frame.
