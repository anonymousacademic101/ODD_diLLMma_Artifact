The road runs horizontally across the image, as indicated by the direction of the lanes, lane markings, and the vehicles' positioning on the road, all of which suggest a typical perspective of a straight portion of a highway or road as seen from the driver's vantage point. There are no visible signs of an intersection such as cross traffic, traffic signals, or signage that typically accompanies intersections. The road appears to continue into the distance without any perpendicular crossing paths, indicating that it's not an intersection.
