YES

The road we are driving on runs horizontally across the image. The view is of a multilane highway that extends from the bottom to the top of the image, showing vehicles moving parallel to the horizon, which indicates a horizontal direction relative to the image's perspective. The overpass seen in the image is part of a different road that intersects the highway perpendicularly, creating an overpass above the highway.
