YES

Although there's the glare of the sun slightly obstructing the view, looking at the layout of the road, the position of the vehicle in front, and the surrounding landscape including the building alignment and parking spaces, it is evident we are on a road that runs horizontally across the image. The vehicle is oriented towards the horizon, and there are no visible traffic signals or signs that would indicate an intersection immediately in front. Moreover, the curb on the right-hand side appears to continue forward without interruption, which aligns with a straight road rather than an intersection.
