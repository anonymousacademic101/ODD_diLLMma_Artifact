NO

The road doesn't appear to be at an intersection nor does it run horizontally across the image. We seem to be on a road with vehicles aligned in a queue, indicating that the road is likely straight in the direction we're facing rather than horizontal to the perspective of the camera. Moreover, there's no clear evidence of an intersection immediately ahead; the road ahead continues without visible intersecting traffic lanes.
