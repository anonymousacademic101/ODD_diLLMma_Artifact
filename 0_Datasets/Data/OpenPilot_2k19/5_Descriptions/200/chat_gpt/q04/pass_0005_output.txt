NO

The road does not run horizontally across the image; instead, it extends into the distance from the bottom to the top of the image, indicating that we're viewing the road in a more or less straight line from the perspective of someone driving on it. Furthermore, there's no indication of intersecting roadways in the visible parts of the image, suggesting that we're on a continuous stretch of road rather than at an intersection.
