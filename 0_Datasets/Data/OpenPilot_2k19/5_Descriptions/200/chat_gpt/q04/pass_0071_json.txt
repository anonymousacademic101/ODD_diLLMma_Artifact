This is evident from the visible lane markings and the orientation of the parked cars on the side of the road, which indicate that the traffic flows from left to right, or horizontally, in the context of the image. Additionally, the curb cuts and pedestrian crossing path are perpendicular to the travel lanes, suggesting we're looking at a regular stretch of road rather than an intersection."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
