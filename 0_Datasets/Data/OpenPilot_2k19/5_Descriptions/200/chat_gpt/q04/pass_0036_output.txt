YES

The road runs horizontally across the image from the perspective of the camera. This can be deduced from the layout of the road markings which are parallel to the bottom edge of the photograph and stretch horizontally from the left to the right of the frame. The headlights of the vehicle illuminate the road directly ahead, displaying no visible turns that would indicate an intersection within the field of view provided by the image. Additionally, the visible road signs are facing perpendicular to the direction of travel, suggesting they are intended for traffic on a different road, indicative of an intersection being present just not primarily depicted. This suggests that we are approaching an intersection rather than driving on it.
