YES

The road we are observing runs horizontally across the image. This can be determined by examining the layout of the road markings, the position of traffic signals and signs, and the orientation of the vehicles in relation to the camera's perspective. The orientation of the road, traffic patterns, and infrastructure as viewed in the image are consistent with a horizontal road crossing the field of view from left to right.
