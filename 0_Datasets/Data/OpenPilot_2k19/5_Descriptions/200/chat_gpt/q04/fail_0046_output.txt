NO

The road itself appears to run horizontally across the image. The vehicle is in a parking lot or a stopping area, and not actively on a road. The direction of the car parked in front suggests that the drivable area goes from left to right or vice versa across the picture, but it is not clear whether this is a road or a driveway of a business (such as a car service station). An intersection is not evident from the perspective provided.
