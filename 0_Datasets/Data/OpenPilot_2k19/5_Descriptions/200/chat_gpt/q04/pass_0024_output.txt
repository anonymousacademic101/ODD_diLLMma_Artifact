YES

The road runs horizontally across the image from the perspective of the camera. This can be identified by the flow of traffic in parallel lanes that extend from the foreground to the background, along with the orientation of the cars, which are aligned parallel to the bottom frame of the image. This suggests a typical highway or freeway scenario rather than an intersection.
