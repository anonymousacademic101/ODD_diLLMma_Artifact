The road shown in the image runs horizontally across the image from the perspective of the camera. This can be determined by the orientation of the vehicles, which are aligned parallel to the horizontal axis of the photo, indicating that they are traveling on a road that stretches from left to right across the frame. Additionally, the lane markings and the direction of the headlights and tail lights all suggest a horizontal roadway rather than an intersection.
