NO

The road does not run horizontally across the image. The perspective from the vehicle suggests we are parked or moving in a parking lot with multiple lanes for parking, rather than on a road that runs horizontally. The cars are seen parked perpendicular to the viewer's line of sight, which is typical for a parking lot, not for a road that would run horizontally across the image.
