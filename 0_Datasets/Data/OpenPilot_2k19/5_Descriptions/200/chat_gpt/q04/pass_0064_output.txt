The road does not run horizontally across the image; it extends into the distance from the bottom center towards the top center of the image, giving the perspective of driving along the road. The lane markings recede into the distance, indicating that we are looking along the length of the road rather than across it. Additionally, there are no visible signs of an intersection such as traffic signals, crosswalks, or intersecting traffic lanes that would typically be present in an intersection view.
