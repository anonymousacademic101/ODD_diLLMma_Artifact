NO.

The road we are driving on appears to be curving and leading towards an intersection as evidenced by the presence of traffic signals ahead and lane markings that suggest a point where traffic flow is directed to intersect with another road. The road does not run horizontally across the image; instead, the perspective of the image shows the road leading forward from the bottom towards the intersection ahead.
