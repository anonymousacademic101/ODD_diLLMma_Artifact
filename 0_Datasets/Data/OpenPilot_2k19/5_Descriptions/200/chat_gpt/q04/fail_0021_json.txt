This can be inferred because there are traffic lights situated above the road, indicating points where traffic may be controlled for crossing directions. Furthermore, the wide expanse of pavement visible and the orientation of the road markings suggest multiple lanes for different directions of travel, characteristic of an intersection. The visible traffic signal straight ahead is red, indicating a stop for the direction in which the vehicle is heading, which is typical at intersections.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
