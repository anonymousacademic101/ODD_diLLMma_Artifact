NO.

The road we are driving on does not run across the image; instead, it extends into the distance from the bottom to the top of the frame, indicating a perspective commonly seen when on a straight path. There are no visible signs of an intersection, such as crossing traffic lanes or traffic signals that would typically indicate an intersection. Instead, we see vehicles aligned and moving in the same direction, which suggests a straight road rather than an intersection.
