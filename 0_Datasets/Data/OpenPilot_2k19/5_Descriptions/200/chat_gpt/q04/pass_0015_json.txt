The vehicle is oriented towards the horizon, and there are no visible traffic signals or signs that would indicate an intersection immediately in front. Moreover, the curb on the right-hand side appears to continue forward without interruption, which aligns with a straight road rather than an intersection."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
