However, judging by the image provided, the road we observe does not appear to show an intersection directly within the field of view. Instead, we see a stretch of road that extends horizontally across the frame. No evident intersecting roads are visible from this perspective. The use of "horizontal" seems to refer to the orientation of the road in the image, which does indeed appear horizontal from this viewpoint. However, without additional context or a broader view, it\'s impossible to conclusively determine if there\'s an intersection just outside the field of view.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
