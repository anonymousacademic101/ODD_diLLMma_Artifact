NO.

The road appears to run horizontally across the image rather than at an intersection based on the perspective seen in the image, where the headlights illuminate the scene directly in front and there is no visible indication of a road continuing straight ahead into the darkness. The angle of the fence and the signage seems to suggest that the road turns or bends rather than intersects with another road directly ahead.
