This can be inferred because the parked cars are aligned perpendicularly to the viewer's perspective, indicating that they are parked along the side of a road that extends horizontally in the image. An intersection would typically show roads that either converge or cross, and there is no such visual evidence in this image."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
