YES

The road you are on runs horizontally across the image. It is identified as such because the lane markings and pedestrian crossings are oriented in a manner that indicates the road continues straight ahead from the perspective of the camera. Furthermore, the traffic lights are facing the camera, suggesting that the direction of traffic flow is towards and away from the camera's viewpoint. This indicates that from the camera's perspective, the road runs horizontally across the image.
