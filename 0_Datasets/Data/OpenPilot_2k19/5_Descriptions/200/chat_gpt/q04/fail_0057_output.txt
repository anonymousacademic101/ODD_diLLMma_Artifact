YES

The road runs horizontally across the image. We can deduce this because the cars are aligned in a horizontal fashion relative to the frame of the photo, indicating that the road on which they are queued is running left to right. The positioning of the headlights, taillights, and the visible lane markings further imply a horizontal direction of the road. Additionally, the angle of view shows the vehicles' side profiles, consistent with looking across a horizontally oriented road. There is no clear indication of an intersection within the visible area of the image.
