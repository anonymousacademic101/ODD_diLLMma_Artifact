YES

The road runs horizontally across the image. There is a clear view of the road extending from the bottom left to the mid-right of the image, with no visible intersecting roads. The arrow on the pavement indicates a forward direction of travel and there are buildings on both sides, suggesting that the road is not at an intersection but continues straight ahead in the frame.
