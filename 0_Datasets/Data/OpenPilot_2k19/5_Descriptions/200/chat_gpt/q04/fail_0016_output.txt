The road appears to be running horizontally across the image. The perspective from within a vehicle shows the dashboard and the windshield view of the night scene, which includes the illuminated signage of a gas station to the right. The orientation of parked vehicles at the gas station and the positioning of the street lights suggest that the road stretches horizontally from the left to the right side of the image. Moreover, the glow from vehicle lights on the left side indicates traffic parallel to the parked vehicles' orientation, supporting the horizontal layout of the road.
