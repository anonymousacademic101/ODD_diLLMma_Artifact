NO.

The road depicted in the image is not an intersection and it does not run horizontally across the image. It appears to be a divided highway or a road with a median, where the lanes for the opposing traffic are separated by a physical barrier or space. The angle from which we observe the vehicles indicates that they are traveling perpendicular to our line of sight, suggesting that we are at a point where one could either cross or turn onto that road rather than being on it.
