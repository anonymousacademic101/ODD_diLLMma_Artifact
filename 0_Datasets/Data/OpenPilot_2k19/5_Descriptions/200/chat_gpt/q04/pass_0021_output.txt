The road does not run horizontally across the image nor does it appear to be a typical intersection. The perspective shows that we are in a queue, likely at a drive-thru lane of a restaurant, which is indicated by the presence of a service window and a car waiting in front of us. The road is thus running vertically from the perspective of the camera towards the building, and we are following the car in front in a path determined by the drive-thru lane, which usually wraps around the building.
