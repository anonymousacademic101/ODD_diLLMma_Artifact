YES

The road we are driving on is an intersection. This can be identified by the traffic lights visible for different directions and the pedestrian crosswalk lines, which indicate the points where roads cross each other. Additionally, the lanes appear to be divided by stop lines where vehicles would wait for the traffic signal, which is a common feature of intersections.
