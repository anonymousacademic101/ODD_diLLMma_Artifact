NO.

The road does not appear to be an intersection. It seems to run horizontally across the image as we see lanes of traffic parallel to one another moving in the same direction, typical of a straight stretch of road or highway. There are no visible traffic signals, stop signs, or markings that would indicate the presence of an intersection. The road markings suggest it's a multiple-lane roadway without intersecting paths.
