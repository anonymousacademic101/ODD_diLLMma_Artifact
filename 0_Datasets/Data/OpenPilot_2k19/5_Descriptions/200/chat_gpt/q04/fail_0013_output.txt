YES

The road runs horizontally across the image. There is a line of cars parked on the right side of the road, which suggests that it is a parking area or the edge of a road, and no intersection is directly visible from this angle. The flow of traffic appears to be parallel to the bottom edge of the image, indicating a straight road rather than an intersection.
