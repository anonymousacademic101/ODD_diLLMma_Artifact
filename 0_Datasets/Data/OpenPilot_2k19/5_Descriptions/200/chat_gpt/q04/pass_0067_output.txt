YES

The road appears to run horizontally across the image based on the placement and orientation of the vehicles and the layout of the parking lot. The car in the foreground is positioned perpendicular to the viewpoint, suggesting it is crossing the field of view rather than coming towards or away from the perspective of the camera, which implies the road runs horizontally across the image rather than at an intersection directed towards the camera.
