YES

The road runs horizontally across the image. The perspective of the photo shows a straight road viewed from within a vehicle, with other vehicles parallel to the viewer's direction indicating a horizontal layout. There are also markings on the road that are typical for a road that runs horizontally in relation to the photo's frame. Additionally, a traffic light facing directly towards the viewer further confirms the horizontal direction. The presence of a crosswalk perpendicular to the viewer's perspective implies an intersection, but the question is about the road we're on, not the presence of an intersection.
