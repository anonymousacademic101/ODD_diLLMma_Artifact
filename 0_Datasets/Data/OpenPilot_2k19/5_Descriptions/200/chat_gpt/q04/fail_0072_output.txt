NO

The road in the image does not run horizontally across the image. It appears we are on a road that extends into the distance from the viewpoint of the camera which is placed within a vehicle. The road is oriented in a manner that suggests we are moving along it rather than it running across our field of vision. There is a clear visible lane marking down the center of the road that indicates travel in two opposing directions, consistent with typical road orientation, not an intersection.
