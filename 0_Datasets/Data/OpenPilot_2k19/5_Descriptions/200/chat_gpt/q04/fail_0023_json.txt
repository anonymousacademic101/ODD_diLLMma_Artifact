There are no visible indications such as traffic lights, multiple roadways, or other markers that would suggest this is an intersection. The road ahead is illuminated by the vehicle's headlights and the guardrail is aligned parallel to the road, indicating a continuous path rather than an intersecting one. Additionally, the road signs visible are warning of a curve ahead, which supports the interpretation of a continuous road rather than an intersection."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
