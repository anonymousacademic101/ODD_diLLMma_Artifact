NO

The road pictured does not appear to be an intersection. The image shows a car driving in a line, likely through a drive-thru lane or a similar one-way passage beside a building, which suggests that the road runs horizontally across the image and it does not display the characteristics of an intersection where two or more roads cross each other.
