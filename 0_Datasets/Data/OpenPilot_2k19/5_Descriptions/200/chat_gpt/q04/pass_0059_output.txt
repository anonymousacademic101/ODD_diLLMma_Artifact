The road runs horizontally across the image. This photo depicts a highway or multi-lane road that is stretching out in front of the viewer, not at an intersection. The vehicles are traveling parallel to the bottom edge of the image, indicating the road's horizontal orientation relative to the camera's perspective. The signage overhead also indicates directions for lanes, which is typical for a multi-lane road rather than an intersection.
