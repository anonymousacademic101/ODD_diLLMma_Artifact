NO

The road is not an intersection, nor does it run horizontally across the image. It appears to be a multi-lane highway extending into the distance from the perspective of the viewer, with lanes dividing traffic moving in the same direction. The image shows a road that one would be driving on in a typical forward motion, not across the image frame.
