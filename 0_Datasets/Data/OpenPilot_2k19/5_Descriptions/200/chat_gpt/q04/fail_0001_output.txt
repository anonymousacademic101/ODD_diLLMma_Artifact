NO

The road does not appear to be an intersection, nor does it run horizontally across the image. Rather, based on the position of the vehicle's hood and the curb visible, it seems that you are in a parking lot or a drive-thru lane that is perpendicular to the building in front of you. The road is leading towards the building, indicating a head-on approach, not a horizontal path across the image.
