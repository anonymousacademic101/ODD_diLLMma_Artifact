NO

The road does not run horizontally across the image; rather, it appears that we are positioned in a parking lot looking at parked cars, as indicated by the parking lines visible in the foreground and the arrangement of the cars. The cars are parked perpendicular to the viewpoint, suggesting the lanes for car movement would run vertically from the perspective of the image. There's no clear intersection shown in the image.
