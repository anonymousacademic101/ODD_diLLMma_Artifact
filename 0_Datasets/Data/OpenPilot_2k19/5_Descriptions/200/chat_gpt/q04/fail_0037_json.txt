The visible pavement markings indicate turn lanes, suggesting multiple directions of travel, which is characteristic of intersections. The image shows arrows painted on the road pointing to the left, which typically guide drivers through turns at intersections. Furthermore, there seems to be another road that runs horizontally across the image, meeting the road we are on, thus forming an intersection.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
