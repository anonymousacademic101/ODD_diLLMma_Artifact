The road runs horizontally across the image. From the perspective shown in the image, we are viewing the road from inside a vehicle, and we can see multiple lanes of traffic moving parallel to the vehicle's direction. There are no visible signs of an intersection, such as cross traffic or traffic lights, indicating that the road is indeed running horizontally across the image.
