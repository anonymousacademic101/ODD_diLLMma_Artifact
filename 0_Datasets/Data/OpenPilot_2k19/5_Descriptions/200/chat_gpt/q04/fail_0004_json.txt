This is deduced by observing the orientation of parked cars, which are perpendicular to the viewer's perspective, suggesting that the vehicle is facing towards an intersecting road. Additionally, the layout of the parking spaces and the direction in which the parked cars are facing imply that the viewer is not on a road running horizontally across the image but rather at a point where two roads intersect."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
