NO

The road seen in the image is not an intersection nor does it run horizontally across the image. The perspective suggests we are in a drive-thru lane at a fast-food establishment or similar facility following another vehicle, indicated by the presence of a menu board and a pick-up window on the building to the left. The drive-thru lane appears to curve slightly to the right as it approaches the pick-up window where the car ahead is stopped.
