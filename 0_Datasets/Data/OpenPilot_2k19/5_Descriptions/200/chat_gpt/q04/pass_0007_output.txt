The road runs horizontally across the image from the perspective of the image frame. The road marks, specifically the lane lines, are parallel to the bottom edge of the image, indicating that the road extends horizontally across the visual field of the image. An intersection would typically show converging or crossing lines indicating multiple paths of travel, which is not evident here.
