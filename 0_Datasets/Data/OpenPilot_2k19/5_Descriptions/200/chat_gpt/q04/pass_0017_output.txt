The question seems to imply a binary choice where one option must exclude the other, but the road in the image can both intersect with another (an intersection) and run horizontally across the image. Detecting an intersection would require indications such as cross traffic, stop signs, traffic signals, or a T-junction, which are not visible in the given frame. The existing visual information shows a road that extends horizontally from the perspective of the viewer, with a vehicle directly in front, suggesting we are on a street rather than specifically at an intersection point.
