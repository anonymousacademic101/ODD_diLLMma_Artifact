NO

The road does not appear to be an intersection. The image shows a road with traffic lanes running horizontally across the image, and there are lane markings that suggest a straight path rather than an intersection. Additionally, the flow of traffic is consistent with a multi-lane road without the crossing or merging of different traffic streams that would indicate an intersection.
