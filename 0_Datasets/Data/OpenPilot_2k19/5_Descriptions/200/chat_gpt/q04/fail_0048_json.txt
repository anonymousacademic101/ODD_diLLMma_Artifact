This can be determined because there are visible traffic signals and crosswalk lines typical of an intersection, and the layout of the roads confirms that they intersect with each other at this point. Vehicles are also positioned in a manner that suggests they are navigating the intersection, including some facing perpendicular to the viewer's perspective, which further indicates that the road runs across the image as well. The presence of a green traffic light ahead also suggests that the road we are on intersects with the road that runs horizontally across the image."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
