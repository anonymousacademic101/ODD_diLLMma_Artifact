The lanes are marked with horizontal lines, and there is no visible intersection disrupting the flow of traffic, which suggests the road is continuing straight rather than intersecting with another road within the frame of the image. Additionally, the road signs and lights are oriented to serve traffic moving in this horizontal direction, reinforcing the layout of the road.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
