NO

The road does not run horizontally across the image; instead, it stretches into the distance from the bottom to the top of the image, indicating the direction of travel is towards the vanishing point on the horizon, which is a standard perspective of a road when you are driving on it. The road appears to be a highway with multiple lanes and a central reservation to the left, marked by barriers and signs intended for vehicles traveling in the opposite direction. There are no visible intersections in the image; the road looks like a continuous stretch of a highway without any cross traffic, which characterizes intersections.
