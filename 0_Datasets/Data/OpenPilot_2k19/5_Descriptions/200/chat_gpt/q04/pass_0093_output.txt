The road does not run horizontally across the image; rather, it appears to be from the perspective of a driver on the road, thus running into the depth of the image, indicating we are on a section of a road rather than an intersection. The road markings suggest forward movement, and there is no visible crossing traffic that would typically indicate an intersection.
