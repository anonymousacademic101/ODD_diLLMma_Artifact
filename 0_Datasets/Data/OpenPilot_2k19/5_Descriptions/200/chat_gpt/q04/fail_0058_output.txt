YES

The road we are driving on runs horizontally across the image. This is evident from the placement of the traffic signals and the orientation of the vehicles. The traffic light is facing towards us, indicating that the road we are on intersects with another, and the road we are approaching runs across from left to right. Additionally, the painted crosswalk stripes are perpendicular to our direction of travel, which is typical for an intersection.
