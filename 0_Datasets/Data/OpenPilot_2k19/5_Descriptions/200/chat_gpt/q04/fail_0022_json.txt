You can tell because the lanes of the road and their respective markings lead directly across from the lower portion of the image to the upper portion, indicating a horizontal path relative to the image's orientation. Additionally, the positioning of the vehicles and the visible crosswalk lines reinforce the horizontal direction of this section of the road. This horizontal road appears to intersect with another road, forming a crossroads, which is a typical characteristic of an intersection."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
