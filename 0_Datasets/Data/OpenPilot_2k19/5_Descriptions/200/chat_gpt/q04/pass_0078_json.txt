We can determine this because the lanes of the road extend from the bottom of the image toward the horizon in a straight manner, which indicates that the road is laid out horizontally in the image's perspective. If the road was an intersection, we would typically see intersecting lanes or traffic signals that would indicate the presence of crossing paths, which are not evident in this image."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
