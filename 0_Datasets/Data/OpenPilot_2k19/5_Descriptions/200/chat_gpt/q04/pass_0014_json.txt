The perspective of the image suggests we are looking at a drive-through lane at a fast-food restaurant, following the same direction as the car ahead. There's a yellow arrow on the pavement pointing forward, indicating the direction of the drive-through path. An intersection would typically feature cross traffic, which is not present in this scenario."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
