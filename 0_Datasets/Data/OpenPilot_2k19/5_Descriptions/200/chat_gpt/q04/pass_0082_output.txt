The road runs horizontally across the image from the viewer's perspective. The lines on the road suggest that we are driving on a straight path and there are no visible indications of an intersection in the image provided. The road markings indicate lanes for vehicles moving in the same direction, typical of a highway or multi-lane road, rather than an intersection which would show markings for crossing or turning lanes.
