The road appears to be a highway with multiple lanes and a central reservation to the left, marked by barriers and signs intended for vehicles traveling in the opposite direction. There are no visible intersections in the image; the road looks like a continuous stretch of a highway without any cross traffic, which characterizes intersections.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
