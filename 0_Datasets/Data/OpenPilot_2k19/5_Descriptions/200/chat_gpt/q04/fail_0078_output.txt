The road we are driving on runs horizontally across the image. We can determine this by observing that the vehicles ahead are moving perpendicular to our viewpoint, indicating that they are crossing the road we are on, suggesting that it is an intersection. Additionally, the presence of traffic lights and crosswalk markings supports the indication of an intersection.
