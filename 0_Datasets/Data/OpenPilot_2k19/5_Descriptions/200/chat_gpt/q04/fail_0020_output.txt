The image shows a view from inside a car at a stop, looking out onto a road that spans horizontally across the frame. We can observe that this road is an intersection because there are signal lights facing multiple directions, which typically control traffic flow through cross streets. The horizontal orientation of the road across the image is evident from the perspective, showing the road's width and the presence of lanes and traffic lights intended for the direction perpendicular to the viewer's point of view.
