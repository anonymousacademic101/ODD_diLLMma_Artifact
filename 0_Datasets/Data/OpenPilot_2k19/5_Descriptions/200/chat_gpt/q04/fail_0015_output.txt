YES

The road we are driving on in the image appears to be part of an intersection. The presence of traffic signals, road markings that indicate turning lanes, and multiple paths for vehicles to travel in different directions collectively suggest this. Additionally, the arrangement of vehicles waiting at what appears to be a stop line for a red signal implies that this is a typical intersection configuration where roads meet and traffic is controlled by signals.
