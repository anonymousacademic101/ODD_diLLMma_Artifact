The road runs horizontally across the image. The clues indicating this are the orientation of the parked car on the right side, which is perpendicular to the median strip and the lane markings, suggesting that the traffic flows left and right from the perspective the image is taken. Additionally, the traffic light facing the viewer would typically be positioned to control traffic flowing in this horizontal direction.
