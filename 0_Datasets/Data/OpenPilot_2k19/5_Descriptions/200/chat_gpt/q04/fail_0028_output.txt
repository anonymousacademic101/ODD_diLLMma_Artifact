YES

The road runs horizontally across the image. This can be concluded from the fact that the road's painted lines and borders extend from one side of the image to the other, indicating a horizontally oriented roadway perspective relative to the camera's viewpoint. The curvature of the road does not necessarily imply an intersection, and there are no clear markings of intersecting roads visible in the immediate foreground.
