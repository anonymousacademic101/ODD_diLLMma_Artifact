The road does not run horizontally across the image; it extends from the foreground into the background, indicating we are viewing it in a direction that corresponds with the direction of travel, rather than across. The road appears to be a multi-lane road that we are driving on, and it is aligned in a vertical perspective relative to the image frame, not horizontal.
