NO.

The road depicted in the image does not show an intersection, nor does it run horizontally across the image. Instead, it shows a perspective of a roadway extending into the distance from the viewpoint of a driver on the road, creating a vertical vanishing point according to the image's perspective. The lanes and vehicles are oriented in a direction that aligns more vertically than horizontally with respect to the image's frame.
