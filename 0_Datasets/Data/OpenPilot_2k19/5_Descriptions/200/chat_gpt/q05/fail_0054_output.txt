The image provided shows a view from a vehicle at night and depicts a typical road scene with vehicles but does not show a clear view of lane markings or road signs that would indicate the presence of any restricted lanes such as bus lanes or bicycle lanes. Furthermore, given the darkness and the angle of the view, it's difficult to discern road markings or additional lanes outside of the immediate lane the vehicle occupied when the photo was taken.
