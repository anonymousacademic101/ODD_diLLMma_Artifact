YES

The image shows a road with multiple lanes of traffic. Although we cannot see any explicit road signs or markings in the visible section that would indicate a restricted lane, the presence of a shoulder on the right side and common traffic regulations suggest the possibility of a bus or carpool lane typically found on the far right or far left lanes of such roads. Without clear signs or road markings in the image, we cannot definitively determine the presence of a restricted lane, but given the context and common roadway layouts, it is plausible.
