The image shows a nighttime scene with limited visibility, and no road markings or signs that specify lane restrictions are visible in the portion of the road that is illuminated by the vehicle's headlights. The quality of the image and the lighting conditions do not allow for a conclusive identification of lane restrictions. Therefore, the answer is based on the available visual information which does not show any restricted lanes."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
