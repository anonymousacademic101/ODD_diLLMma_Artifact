Based on the image provided, it appears to be a nighttime scene of a multiple-lane road without visible indications of lane restrictions such as bus or bicycle lanes. Restricted lanes are typically marked with specific road surface markings and signs, none of which are visible in this dark image. However, please note the visibility is limited and therefore this assessment might not reveal temporary or less visible restrictions that could exist under different lighting conditions or outside the camera's field of view.
