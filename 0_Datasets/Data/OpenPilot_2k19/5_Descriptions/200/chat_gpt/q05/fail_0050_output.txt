NO.

The image provided is unclear and does not provide enough visual information to determine if there are any restricted lanes, such as bus or bicycle lanes on the road we are driving on. The photo seems to be taken from inside a vehicle at night with reflections on the windshield, and there's no visible signage or road markings indicating the presence of such restricted lanes. Additionally, the focus and quality of the image are poor, making it impossible to make out any specific lane restrictions.
