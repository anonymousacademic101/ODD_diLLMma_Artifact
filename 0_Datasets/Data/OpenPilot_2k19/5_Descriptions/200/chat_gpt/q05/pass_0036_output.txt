NO

Based on the image provided, it does not show any specific markings or signs that would indicate the presence of a restricted lane such as a bus lane or a bicycle lane. The road markings visible in the image consist of a dashed white line and a solid white line on the right edge which are common for delineating lanes and the edge of the roadway, respectively. However, without clearer signs or road markings explicitly indicating restrictions, we cannot confirm the presence of any dedicated restricted lanes from this image alone.
