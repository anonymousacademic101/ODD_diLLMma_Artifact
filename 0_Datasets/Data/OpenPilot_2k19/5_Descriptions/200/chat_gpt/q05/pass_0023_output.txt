YES

While the image is not completely clear due to low lighting conditions, there are a few signs indicating that there might be a restricted lane. Typically, roads with high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes, bus lanes, or bicycle lanes are marked with specific road markings or signs that denote these restrictions. However, given the conditions depicted in the image, it is difficult to be certain of the lane restrictions without seeing such signage or road markings clearly. It is possible that there could be a designated lane for high occupancy vehicles or a similar restriction that isn't immediately identifiable in the provided image.
