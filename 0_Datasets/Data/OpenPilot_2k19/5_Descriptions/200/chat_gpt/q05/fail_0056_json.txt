There are no visible signs or road markings that indicate the presence of any restricted lanes such as bus lanes or bicycle lanes. Furthermore, all vehicles appear to be typical passenger cars and there's no distinction that would suggest any restrictions on the use of this lane. Due to the image's low resolution and the nighttime conditions, finer details are difficult to discern, but based on what is visible, there is no evidence to suggest the presence of restricted lanes."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
