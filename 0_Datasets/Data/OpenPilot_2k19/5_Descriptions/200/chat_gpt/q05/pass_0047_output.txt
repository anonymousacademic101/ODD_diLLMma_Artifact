The image shows a dashed line and a solid white line demarcating a lane on the right side of the road. This is often indicative of a lane that may have usage restrictions, such as a bus lane, a bike lane, or a lane reserved for right turns only. The presence of such markings suggests that there are some form of restricted lanes, although without seeing any specific signs or further context it is hard to determine the exact nature of the restrictions.
