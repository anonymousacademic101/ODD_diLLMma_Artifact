The road seems to be a standard multi-lane highway typically found in many regions, designed for use by all types of motor vehicles without any visible signage or road markings that would suggest restrictions for special types of vehicles like buses or bicycles. Additionally, bicycle lanes are not common on high-speed roadways, and bus-specific lanes would generally be clearly marked, which are not apparent in this image.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
