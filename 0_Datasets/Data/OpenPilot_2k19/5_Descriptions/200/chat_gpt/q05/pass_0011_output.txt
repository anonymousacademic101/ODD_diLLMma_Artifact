Based on the image provided, I cannot see any specific road markings or signs that would indicate the presence of a restricted lane specifically designated for buses or bicycles on this road. Typically, such lanes would be marked with distinct symbols or words painted on the pavement and/or posted signs, which are not visible in this image. This image shows a multi-lane road with no visible indications of lane restrictions.
