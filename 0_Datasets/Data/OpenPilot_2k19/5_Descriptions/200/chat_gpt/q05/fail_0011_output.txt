NO

Based on the information visible in the image, there are no clear signs or road markings present that indicate the existence of restricted lanes such as bus lanes or bicycle lanes ahead in the direction we are traveling. The road ahead appears to have general traffic lanes without any specific designations for buses, bicycles, or other restricted use. However, without additional context or signs outside the visible area, it cannot be confirmed if there are such lanes further down the road or on adjacent streets.
