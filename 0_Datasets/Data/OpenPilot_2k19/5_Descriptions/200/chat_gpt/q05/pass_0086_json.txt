While the image does not explicitly show signage or road markings for a restricted lane such as a bus lane or bicycle lane, such restrictions are common on highways, especially in or near urban areas. The HOV lanes are usually indicated by specific signs or road markings, which might not be visible in this particular image due to the angle and distance from the signage. But based on common road layouts, there could indeed be restricted lanes on this segment of the highway or further along.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
