The road appears to be a multi-lane highway typically used by motor vehicles, and no specific signage or road markings are observable that would denote a lane restriction for certain types of vehicles. Bike lanes are also generally not found on highways due to safety considerations. However, it's important to note that visibility is limited, and certain restrictions could exist beyond what can be seen in the image."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
