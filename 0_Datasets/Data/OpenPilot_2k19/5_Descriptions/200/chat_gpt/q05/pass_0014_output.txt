The image provided appears to show a vehicle queuing in a drive-thru lane at a fast-food restaurant, rather than a public road. Therefore, there would not be designated lanes for buses or bicycles within this context. Public road traffic regulations and dedicated lanes for certain types of vehicles, like bus lanes or bike lanes, typically do not apply to the circulation on private property, such as a drive-thru.
