NO

I cannot see any signs or markings indicating that there are restricted lanes designated specifically for buses or bicycles in the image provided. All lanes appear to be regular traffic lanes, and no painted symbols or signage for bus or bicycle lanes are visible. Without such indicators, it's reasonable to conclude that there are no restricted lanes on this section of the road.
