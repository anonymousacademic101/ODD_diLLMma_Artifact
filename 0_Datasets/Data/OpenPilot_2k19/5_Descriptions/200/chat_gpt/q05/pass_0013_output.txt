The image does not depict a roadway with marked lanes designated for specific traffic such as buses or bicycles; it shows the view from a vehicle in a drive-thru line at a fast-food restaurant. Consequently, standard road regulations and lane designations like bus or bike lanes are not applicable within this private property setting, which is meant for customer service and not for through traffic.
