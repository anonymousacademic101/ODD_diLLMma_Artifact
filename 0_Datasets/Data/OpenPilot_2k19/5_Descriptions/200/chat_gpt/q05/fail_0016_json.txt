It appears to be from the perspective of a driver looking out onto a dimly lit street with a gas station on the right. Due to the combination of low light and reflections, it is impossible to make out the road markings clearly enough to determine if there are any restricted lanes, like those designated for buses or bicycles. Therefore, without a clear view of road markings or signage, it cannot be conclusively stated that there are restricted lanes present based on this image alone.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
