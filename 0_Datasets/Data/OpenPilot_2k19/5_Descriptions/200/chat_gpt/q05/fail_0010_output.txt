NO.

The image shown does not depict the vehicle driving on a road. Instead, the vehicle is in a drive-thru lane of a restaurant, which is not a public road with marked lanes for traffic, buses, or bicycles. Drive-thru lanes are designed for motor vehicles to queue and place orders at restaurants and are not subject to the same rules and regulations as public roads.
