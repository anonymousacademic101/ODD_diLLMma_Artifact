NO.

The image provided does not depict a road or street where a vehicle is being driven; it shows a view from within a parking lot, looking out at parked cars and a building in the background. There are no visible lanes, traffic signals, or road markings that would indicate the presence of restricted lanes such as bus lanes or bicycle lanes. Therefore, based on the information available in the image, we cannot determine the presence of any restricted lanes on a road, as we are not currently viewing a road with traffic lanes.
