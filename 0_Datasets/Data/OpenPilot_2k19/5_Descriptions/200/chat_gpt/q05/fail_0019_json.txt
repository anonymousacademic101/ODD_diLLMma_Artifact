There are glare and reflections on the windshield, and the image quality does not allow for the clear identification of road markings or signs that would indicate the presence of restricted lanes, such as bus or bicycle lanes. It is also important to note that the camera angle and the position of the vehicle – which appears to be at an intersection or preparing to turn – do not provide a full view of the road ahead where such markings would typically be found. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively determine if there are any restricted lanes solely based on this image.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
