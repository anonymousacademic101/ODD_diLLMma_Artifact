NO

The image provided is not of sufficient clarity to definitively determine if there are any restricted lanes such as bus or bicycle lanes on the road in question. There are no visible road markings or signs in the image that indicate the presence of restricted lanes. To confirm if there are any restricted lanes, one would typically look for specific road markings, signage, or infrastructure such as bus lanes, cycle lanes, or carpool/HOV lanes that are usually clearly marked. Since such visual cues are not apparent in the image provided, it is not possible to say with certainty that there are restricted lanes present.
