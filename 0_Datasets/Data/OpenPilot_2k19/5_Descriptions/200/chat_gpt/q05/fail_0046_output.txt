YES

While the image does not provide a clear view of the road itself, typically, when lanes are restricted for specific types of vehicles such as buses or bicycles, there are signs and road markings indicating such restrictions. However, this image does not show any signs or road markings to confirm the presence of restricted lanes. It is taken from inside a vehicle, and the focus is on a smog check station rather than the road. Without seeing the road markings or signs, we cannot definitively determine whether there are restricted lanes based on this image.
