Based on the image provided, it's not possible to determine with certainty if there are any restricted lanes specifically marked for buses, bicycles, or other special vehicles due to the limited field of view and resolution. However, typically such markings would be clearly visible on the roadway or indicated by signage, which is not evident in this portion of the image. It is important to observe all road signs and markings while driving to ensure compliance with any lane restrictions. If you are on the road in question and unsure about lane restrictions, it's best to look for posted signs or road surface markings that indicate such restrictions.
