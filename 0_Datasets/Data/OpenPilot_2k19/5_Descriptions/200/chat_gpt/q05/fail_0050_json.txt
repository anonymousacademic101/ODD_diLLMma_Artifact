The photo seems to be taken from inside a vehicle at night with reflections on the windshield, and there's no visible signage or road markings indicating the presence of such restricted lanes. Additionally, the focus and quality of the image are poor, making it impossible to make out any specific lane restrictions."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
