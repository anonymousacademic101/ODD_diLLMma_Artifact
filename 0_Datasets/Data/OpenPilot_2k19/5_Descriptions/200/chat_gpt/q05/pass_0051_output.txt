Based on the visible lanes from this perspective, there are no clearly marked restricted lanes such as bus lanes or bicycle lanes. All lanes appear to be general traffic lanes. If there were any restricted lanes, they would typically be marked with specific symbols or signage to designate the restriction, which is not apparent in this image.
