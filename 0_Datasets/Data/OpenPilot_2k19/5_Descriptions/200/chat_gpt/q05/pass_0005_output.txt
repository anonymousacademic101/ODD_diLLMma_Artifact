NO

Based on the image provided, there is no visible signage or road markings that clearly indicate the presence of restricted lanes such as those designated for buses or bicycles. The road appears to be a multi-lane highway typically used by motor vehicles, and such highways often do not include lanes specifically for buses or bicycles. However, due to the low light and motion blur, it is not entirely possible to see all details, but from what is visible, there are no restricted lanes evident.
