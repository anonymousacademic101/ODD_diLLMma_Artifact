There are no visible signs or road markings that indicate any of the lanes are designated for specific types of vehicles, such as buses or bicycles. All lanes appear to be general-purpose lanes for motor vehicle traffic, and considering the setting, it is unlikely that this road would have a bicycle lane as it's not commonplace for high-speed roadways such as this."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
