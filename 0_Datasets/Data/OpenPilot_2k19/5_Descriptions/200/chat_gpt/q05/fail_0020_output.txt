NO

From the image provided, we can observe several lanes, but none of them are visibly marked as restricted lanes such as bus lanes or bicycle lanes. The image does not show any signage or road markings that would indicate the presence of restricted lanes. However, it is important to note that this conclusion is based only on the visible parts of the road in the image, and restricted lanes may exist outside the field of view or further down the road. Moreover, road rules and lane designations can change, so local regulations and signage should always be consulted while driving.
