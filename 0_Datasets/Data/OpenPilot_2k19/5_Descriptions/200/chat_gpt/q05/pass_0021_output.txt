Based on the image provided, it appears that we are not on a public road but rather in a drive-thru lane of a business, likely a fast-food restaurant, given the nature of the building, windows, and signage. Therefore, the question of restricted lanes for buses or bicycles does not apply as those are typically designated on public roads and not within the private property of a drive-thru facility.
