NO.

It is not possible to determine from this image whether there are any restricted lanes on the road, such as bus or bicycle lanes because the photo does not provide a clear view of the lane markings or road signs. The image is taken at night, and the focus is on the tail lights of the vehicles immediately ahead, which limits the visibility of the surrounding road markings and signs that might indicate the presence of restricted lanes.
