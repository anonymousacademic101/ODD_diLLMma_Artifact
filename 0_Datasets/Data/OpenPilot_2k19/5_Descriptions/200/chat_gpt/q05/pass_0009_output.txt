The image shows a multi-lane highway at night, and there are no visible signs or road markings in the picture that indicate the presence of restricted lanes designated for buses or bicycles. Typically, such lanes will have clear signage or distinctive road surface markings, neither of which are apparent in this image. Furthermore, bicycles are generally not permitted on highways, and while some highways do have bus lanes, they are usually clearly marked, which is not evident in this provided picture.
