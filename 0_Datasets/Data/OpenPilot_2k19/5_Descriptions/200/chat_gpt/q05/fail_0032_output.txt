NO.

The image presented shows a view from inside a vehicle; however, due to the brightness and angle of the photo, specific lane markings, signs, or additional lane-specific details indicating restrictions such as dedicated bus or bike lanes are not clearly visible. Consequently, I cannot confirm the presence of any restricted lanes based solely on this image.
