NO.

Based on the image provided, I cannot see any signs or road markings that clearly indicate the presence of restricted lanes specifically designated for buses or bicycles on the section of the road visible in the image. The lanes appear to be general-purpose lanes used by all vehicles. However, without a full view of all road signs and markings, it is not possible to definitively determine the absence of restricted lanes beyond this section of the road.
