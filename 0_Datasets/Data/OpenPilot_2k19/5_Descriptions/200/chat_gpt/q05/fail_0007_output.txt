The image provided does not depict a road but rather a drive-thru lane at a fast food restaurant or similar establishment. As such, there do not appear to be any public road markings or signs indicating the presence of restricted lanes for specific types of vehicles, such as buses or bicycles. Drive-thru lanes are typically intended for motor vehicles only and are on private property, primarily serving the business that operates them.
