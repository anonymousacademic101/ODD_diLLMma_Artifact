NO

Based on the image provided, there is no clear indication of any restricted lanes specifically designated for buses, bicycles, or any other type of restricted traffic. It appears to be a standard road with multiple lanes controlled by traffic lights, and the image does not show any road markings or signs that would suggest the presence of restricted lanes. However, it's important to note that visibility is limited and further information or a clearer view might be needed to confirm the absence of restricted lanes conclusively.
