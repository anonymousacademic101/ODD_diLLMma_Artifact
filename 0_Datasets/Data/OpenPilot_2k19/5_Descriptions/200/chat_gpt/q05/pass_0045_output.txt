NO

Based on the image provided, it is nighttime, and visibility is limited. There are no visible indicators or signs that would suggest there are specific restricted lanes such as bus-only or bicycle lanes on this road. Restricted lanes are typically marked with clear signage or road markings, none of which can be clearly seen in this image. It is important to consider, however, that my analysis is based solely on this image and the actual presence of such lanes would be best determined by daytime visibility or local road knowledge.
