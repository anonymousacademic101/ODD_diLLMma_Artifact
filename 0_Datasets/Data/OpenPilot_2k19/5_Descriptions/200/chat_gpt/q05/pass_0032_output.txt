NO.

Based on the photo provided, it is not possible to determine with certainty if there are restricted lanes designated for buses or bicycles. This nighttime image presents a view of traffic from within a vehicle, and while we can see multiple lanes of traffic, there are no visible signs, road markings, or other indications in the image that specify any lane restrictions. Additionally, restricted lanes generally have distinct markings or signs, which are not apparent here.
