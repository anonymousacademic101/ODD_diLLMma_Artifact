Based on the image provided, it appears that we are in a parking lot rather than on a road with marked lanes for traffic. Given the context and lack of roadway markings or signs indicating lane restrictions for certain types of vehicles such as buses or bicycles, it can be inferred that there are no restricted lanes present in the area captured by the image. Parking lots typically do not have designated bus or bicycle lanes as those are more commonly found on public roads and thoroughfares.
