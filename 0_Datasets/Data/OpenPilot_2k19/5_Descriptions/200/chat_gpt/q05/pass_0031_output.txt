The image shows a nighttime traffic scene from a driver's perspective, and it is not possible to conclusively determine if there are any restricted lanes from this image alone. There are no visible signs or road markings that indicate the presence of bus-only or bicycle lanes. The lanes appear to be occupied by different types of personal vehicles without any distinction that would suggest lane restrictions.
