The image provided shows a road at night with very limited visibility. The only visible signage is a yellow warning sign, which seems to indicate a curve or a similar road condition ahead. There are no visible markings or signs that indicate the presence of restricted lanes such as bus lanes or bicycle lanes. However, due to the darkness and poor visibility, it cannot be conclusively stated that there are no such lanes; they simply are not visible in the image provided.
