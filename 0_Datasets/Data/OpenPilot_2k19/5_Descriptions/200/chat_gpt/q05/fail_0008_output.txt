This image shows a vehicle queue that appears to be in a drive-thru lane of a restaurant, indicating that this is not a public road but rather a private property designed for cars to line up and wait for service. There are no indications of lanes that are specifically restricted for buses, bicycles, or any other mode of transportation within this context. Public road restrictions typically do not apply in such settings.
