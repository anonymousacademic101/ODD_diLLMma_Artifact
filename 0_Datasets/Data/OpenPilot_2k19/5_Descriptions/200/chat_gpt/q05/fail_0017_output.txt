NO.

The image provided does not clearly show the road markings or signs that would indicate the presence of restricted lanes such as bus lanes or bicycle lanes. The view is obstructed by being inside a vehicle that appears to be stationary or moving in a non-road space, possibly a gas station or parking area, as suggested by the gas pumps and the structure labeled "Food Mart." Therefore, based on the information available in the image, it is not possible to confirm the presence of any restricted lanes on the road we might be driving on.
