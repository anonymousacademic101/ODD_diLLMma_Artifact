NO

Based on the visible road markings and the environment, there is no clear indication of any lanes specifically restricted for buses, bicycles, or other types of vehicles. The lanes appear to be general-purpose lanes available to all vehicles without restriction. There are no visible signs or road markings such as diamond lanes, bus lane symbols, or bicycle lane symbols that would indicate the presence of restricted lanes.
