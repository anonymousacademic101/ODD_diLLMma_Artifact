NO.

The image provided shows a parking lot with multiple cars parked, and there's no clear evidence of a road, let alone a hilly road. We can deduce this because the lined parking spaces are designed for a flat surface which is typical for parking lots to facilitate safe and efficient parking of vehicles. Hilly terrains would not have such structured parking arrangements.
