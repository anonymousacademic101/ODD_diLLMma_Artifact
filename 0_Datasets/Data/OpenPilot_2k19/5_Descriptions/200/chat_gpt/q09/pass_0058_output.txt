NO

It is difficult to determine definitively from this image whether the road is hilly or not because the picture is taken at night and visibility is limited. However, the horizon line created by the car lights and the road markings appears to be relatively straight, which may suggest that the road is flat rather than hilly. Without further visual information or context, the lack of visible inclines or declines in the immediate viewpoint suggests a flat road.
