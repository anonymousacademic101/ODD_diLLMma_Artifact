NO.

The road in the image appears to be fairly level without significant inclines or declines indicative of a hilly terrain. The horizon line looks straight, and the vehicles do not show any angle that would suggest they are driving uphill or downhill. The surrounding landscape does show some hills, but they do not directly affect the road's flatness.
