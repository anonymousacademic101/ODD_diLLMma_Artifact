NO

The road in the image appears to be relatively flat and straight in the immediate vicinity. There is no indication from the visible section of the road that suggests it is hilly. The horizon line is level, and the cars are not oriented in a manner that one would expect if the road were significantly inclined or declined. The overpass also appears to be level, supporting the flatness of the road.
