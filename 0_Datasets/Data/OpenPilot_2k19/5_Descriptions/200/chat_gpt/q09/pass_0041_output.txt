NO

The road in the image appears to be generally flat. There is no visible inclination or decline that would suggest the road is hilly. The vehicles are oriented in a level position, and there are no signs of a sloping landscape that are typically associated with hilly roads. The horizontal lines on the road and the positioning of the parked cars on the side also indicate a flat surface.
