YES

From the provided image, you can infer the road is hilly based on the way the vehicles ahead appear to be positioned at different elevations relative to each other and the horizon. The image suggests a downward slope of the road in the immediate foreground, followed by an upward slope further ahead, where the vehicles seem to ascend slightly. This undulating vehicle arrangement is a typical indicator of a hilly or rolling road surface.
