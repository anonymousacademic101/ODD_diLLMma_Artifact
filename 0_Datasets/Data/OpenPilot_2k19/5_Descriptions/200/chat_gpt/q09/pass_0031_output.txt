The road ahead shows a slight upward incline before disappearing from view, suggesting a hill or a rise in the road. The flow of the headlights and tail lights also indicates vehicles are following a path that rises and falls, typical of hilly terrain. Additionally, the concrete barrier on the left side appears to rise in height relative to the car's position, supporting the presence of an incline.
