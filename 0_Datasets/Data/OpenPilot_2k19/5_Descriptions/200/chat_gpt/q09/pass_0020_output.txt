NO

It appears from the image that we are not currently driving on a hilly road but are in fact in a flat drive-thru lane of a restaurant. The surface of the pavement looks level and there is no indication of any inclines or declines in the immediate surroundings. The cars are in a queue and there is a building structure directly beside the lane, which is typical for a drive-thru setup.
