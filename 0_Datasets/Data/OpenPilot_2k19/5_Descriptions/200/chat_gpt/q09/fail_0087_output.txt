NO

The visible evidence in the image does not indicate that the road is hilly; it appears to be quite flat where the photo was taken. There are no visible inclines or declines in the immediate roadway. The cars are parked and are driving on a level surface, and there is no visible change in elevation to suggest that the road is hilly.
