It is not possible to definitively determine whether the road is hilly based solely on the provided image. The image shows a nighttime road view with vehicles stopped, making it difficult to assess the terrain's elevation changes. Other reference points such as distant landscapes or road signs that might indicate steep grades are not visible in the picture.
