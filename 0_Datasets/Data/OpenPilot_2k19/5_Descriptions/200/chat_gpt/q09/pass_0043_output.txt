The road in the image appears relatively flat with no significant inclines or declines visible in the portion of the road that is illuminated by the vehicle's headlights. The straight path and consistent horizon suggest that there are no hills in the immediate vicinity of the road being traveled. However, it is important to note that visibility is limited, and topography outside the range of the headlights cannot be assessed.
