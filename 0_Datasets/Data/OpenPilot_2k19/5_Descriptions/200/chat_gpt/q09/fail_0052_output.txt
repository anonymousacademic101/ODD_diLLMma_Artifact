Based on the image provided, the road appears to be relatively flat in the visible area, without any significant inclines or declines that would suggest a hilly terrain. The perspective seems to be from a parking lot or a road near a CVS Pharmacy, and such locations are typically constructed on flat surfaces for accessibility and ease of use.
