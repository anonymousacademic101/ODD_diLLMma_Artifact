From the given image, it appears that the vehicle is in a parking lot rather than on a road. Additionally, there's no clear indication of hills or slopes in the section of the parking area visible in the photo, which suggests that the surface is relatively flat. The perspective in the image does not show a hilly road, and given that we can see a parked car and part of what seems to be a parking lot for a store, it's unlikely that the area portrayed is hilly.
