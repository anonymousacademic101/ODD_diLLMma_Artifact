The horizon line in the image appears to be slightly elevated in the distance, which suggests that the road is inclining upward, indicating the presence of a hill. Additionally, the trees and vegetation on the sides of the highway are aligned in a way that implies the terrain is not flat, but rather has some degree of elevation change, consistent with a hilly landscape.
