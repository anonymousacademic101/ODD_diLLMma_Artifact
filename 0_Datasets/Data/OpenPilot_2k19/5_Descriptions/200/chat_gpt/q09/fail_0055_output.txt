The image shows a traffic situation where the vehicles' lights form a relatively straight horizontal line, indicating that this specific section of the road is not hilly. Hilly roads typically show a visible undulation in the path of headlights or streetlights. However, since the image only captures a small section, and given the limitations of two-dimensional photographs, it's important to note that this does not conclusively determine the overall topography of the area.
