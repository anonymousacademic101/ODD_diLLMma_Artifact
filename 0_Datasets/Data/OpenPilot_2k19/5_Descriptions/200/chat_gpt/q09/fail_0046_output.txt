NO

The image doesn't show a clear view of the road's topography beyond the immediate area. We are positioned at a parking or service area looking at a stationary car and a building, so the characteristics of the road ahead or behind this point are not visible in this photo, making it impossible to accurately determine whether the road is hilly based on this image alone.
