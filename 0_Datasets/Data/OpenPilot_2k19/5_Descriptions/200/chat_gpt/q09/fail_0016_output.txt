NO.

The image is blurry and taken at night, which limits the amount of detail available. However, based on the visible information, it seems like we are looking at a relatively flat section of a road with a gas station nearby. There are no clear visible indicators of significant elevation changes or slopes that would suggest the road is hilly. The horizon appears flat, and there are no apparent inclines or declines in view.
