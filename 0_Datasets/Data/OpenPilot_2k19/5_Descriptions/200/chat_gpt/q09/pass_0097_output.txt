NO.

The road in the image appears relatively flat and straight, with no significant inclines or declines visible in the immediate driving path. While there may be slight variations in elevation outside the immediate field of view, based on the available image, the road does not exhibit the characteristics typically associated with a "hilly" road such as steep inclines, winding paths, or rolling hills.
