NO

The road in the image appears relatively flat, without any visible significant inclines or declines that would indicate it is hilly. The vehicles on the road are maintaining a consistent lane position without any tilting or angling that might suggest steep slopes or rolling terrain. The curvature of the road and the angle of the headlights also suggest a flat road rather than a hilly one.
