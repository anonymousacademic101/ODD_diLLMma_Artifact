NO.

The road in the image appears to be flat where the vehicle is currently stopped. There is no immediate evidence of a slope, incline, or decline in the section of the road depicted in the photograph. The horizontal alignment of the vehicles at the intersection and the angle of the trees suggests a level road at this point. However, to determine if the road becomes hilly beyond this section, one would need additional visual information or context not provided in this image.
