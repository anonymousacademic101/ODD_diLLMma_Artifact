The image provided appears to show a vehicle queueing in a drive-thru lane of a restaurant, not a road. The view does not allow for the assessment of the terrain beyond the immediate vicinity. However, the visible terrain in the immediate vicinity of the vehicle does not show a hilly road, and drive-thru lanes are generally flat to accommodate ease of access for all vehicles.
