The horizon line is consistent and there do not appear to be any significant inclines or declines that would indicate a hilly road. The lanes and road markings are also continuous and parallel, which is typical for flat terrain. The lack of visible elevation changes supports the assessment that the road is not hilly.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
