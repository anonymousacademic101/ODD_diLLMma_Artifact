NO.

The road in the image appears to be relatively straight and level with no significant inclines or hills visible on the stretch of road ahead. The road surface itself looks even and without significant undulations that would indicate a hilly terrain. The vehicles ahead are also on a level path which supports the assessment that the road is not hilly.
