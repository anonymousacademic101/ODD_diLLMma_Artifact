NO

The image shows a nighttime scene with a road that appears relatively flat. There are no visible signs of inclines or declines that would indicate the road is hilly. Instead, vehicles appear to be on a level surface, and the lines on the road suggest a flat terrain. The lighting conditions, however, make it somewhat challenging to assess the topography with complete certainty, but from what is visible, the road does not appear hilly.
