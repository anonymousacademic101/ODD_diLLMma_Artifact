YES.

The image shows a vehicle in front of us with its front more elevated than its rear, which can suggest that the road ahead is inclined upwards, thus indicating a hilly road. Additionally, looking beyond the car, the horizon line is not parallel to the bottom edge of the image, which may indicate the camera is tilted due to the slope of the road.
