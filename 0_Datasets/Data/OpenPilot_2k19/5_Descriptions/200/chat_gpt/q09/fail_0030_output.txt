NO

From the image provided, the road appears to be relatively flat and level in the immediate vicinity. The lack of visible incline or decline in the road straight ahead, does not indicate a hilly terrain. Additionally, there's no clear evidence of hills in the background that could suggest the surrounding area is hilly. However, without further context or a wider view, it's difficult to assess the topography of the area beyond what is visible in the photograph.
