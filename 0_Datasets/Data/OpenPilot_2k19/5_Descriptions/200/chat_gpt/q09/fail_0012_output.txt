The image shows a relatively flat road surface from the driver's perspective. There is no visible significant incline or decline that would indicate the road is hilly. However, it should be noted that the visibility of the entire road ahead is limited from this single snapshot. The assessment is based only on the immediate section of the road visible in the image.
