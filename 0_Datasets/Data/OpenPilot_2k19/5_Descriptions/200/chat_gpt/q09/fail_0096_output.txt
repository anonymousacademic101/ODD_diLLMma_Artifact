NO

Based on the image provided, it appears that the road ahead is relatively flat with no significant inclines or declines visible from this perspective. The horizon line appears straight and the vehicle on the opposite side does not appear to be tilted in a manner that would suggest hilly terrain. The road also seems to intersect with another level road at a right angle, supporting the assessment of level terrain.
