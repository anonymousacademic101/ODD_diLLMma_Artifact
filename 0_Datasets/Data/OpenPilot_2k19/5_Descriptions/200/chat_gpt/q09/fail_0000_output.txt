The presence of a road sign with an arrow indicating a winding road, often used to warn drivers of upcoming curves and hills, suggests that the road has features such as bends or slopes that are characteristic of hilly terrain. Despite the darkness and limited visibility of the road itself, the sign provides information about the nature of the road ahead.
