The road ahead appears to slightly slope upwards and disappear over a crest, suggesting there is a hill. Additionally, the vehicles in the distance are angled in a way that indicates they are ascending, which supports the observation that the road is hilly at this particular point. The surrounding terrain with rising tree lines on either side of the road further implies the presence of hilly landscape.
