NO

The road appears predominantly flat in the visible stretch. There is no evident inclination or decline that would categorize the road as hilly. The horizon is level, and the lane markings do not show any curvature associated with hilly terrain. The lack of shadow or highlight gradients that would indicate hills also supports the observation that the road is not hilly.
