YES.

While this specific section of the road appears fairly level, the background shows a landscape with elevated terrain, suggesting that the surrounding area is hilly. The road we are on may lead into those hills or be affected by the undulating topography, making it likely that this road, or roads connected to it, could have hilly segments.
