NO

The image is taken at night which limits visibility, but from what can be observed, the road appears rather flat. The horizon line is straight, and there are no immediate indications of hills or significant slopes. The vehicles in the distance don't appear to be positioned at an angle that would suggest a hilly terrain either. The road markings and the distribution of lights seem consistent with a flat roadway.
