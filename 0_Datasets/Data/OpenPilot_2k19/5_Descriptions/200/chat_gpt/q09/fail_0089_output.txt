NO

The road in the image appears to be flat, as indicated by the straight lines and even height of the roadside features like the base of the traffic light and the horizontal guard rails on the bridge. The road surface does not show any signs of incline or decline immediately ahead. However, it's important to note that while this section of the road is flat, I can't provide information on the road's condition beyond this section as it is not visible in the image.
