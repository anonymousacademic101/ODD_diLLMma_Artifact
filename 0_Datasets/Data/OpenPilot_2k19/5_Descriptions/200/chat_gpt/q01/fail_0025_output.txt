NO

The image appears to be taken at night with low light conditions. While the visibility in the photo is low and there's some noise present due to the high ISO or gain that the camera sensor might be using to compensate for the low light, there is no clear evidence of obstruction, covering, or damage by mud, ice, snow, excessive paint or adhesive products on the camera itself. The clarity of the road lines and the visible landscape suggest the lens was not covered or obstructed.
