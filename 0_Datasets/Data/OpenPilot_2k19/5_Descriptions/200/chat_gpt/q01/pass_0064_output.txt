NO

The image you have provided appears clear, with no obvious signs of obstruction or damage by mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products directly on the camera lens. The visibility is good, and the lines on the road, the vehicle in front, and the surrounding environment are visible without significant distortion, which indicates that the camera lens is not obscured. However, please note that it's possible for minor imperfections or smudges on the lens to be present that aren't readily apparent from the image.
