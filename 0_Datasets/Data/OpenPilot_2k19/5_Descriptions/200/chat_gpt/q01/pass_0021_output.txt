The image appears to be taken through a windshield that has some smears or streaks, likely caused by wiping dirt or moisture with wipers or a dirty cloth, but it does not seem that the camera itself was obstructed, covered, or damaged by mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products. The impairments to clarity seem to be on the car's windshield through which the photograph was taken, not on the camera's lens.
