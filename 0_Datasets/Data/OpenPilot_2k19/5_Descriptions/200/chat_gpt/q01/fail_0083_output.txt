The image appears clear except for a few smudges or streaks, likely caused by water spots or dirt on the windshield through which the photo was taken, rather than the camera lens itself being obstructed, covered, or damaged. The visibility through the majority of the image is not impaired to the extent one would expect from such obstruction or damage as mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products directly on the camera.
