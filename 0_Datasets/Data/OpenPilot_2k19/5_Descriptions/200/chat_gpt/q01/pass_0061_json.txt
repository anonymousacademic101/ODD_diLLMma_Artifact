However, there is no evidence of mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products obstructing, covering, or damaging the camera lens. The light artifacts and the overall haziness could result from the atmosphere's condition rather than a dirty or obstructed lens."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
