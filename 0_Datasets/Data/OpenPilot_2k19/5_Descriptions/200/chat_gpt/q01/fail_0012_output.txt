YES

The image shows several spots and marks that suggest that there is something on the camera's lens or protective cover. These could possibly be droplets of water or some kind of light dirt or dust, as they appear semi-transparent and do not completely block the view of the camera but do cause obstruction by creating blurry spots on the image. The overall clarity of the scene suggests the camera itself is not damaged, but there does appear to be some kind of substance on the lens or cover.
