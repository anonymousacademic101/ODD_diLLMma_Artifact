NO

The image appears to be clear of any obstructions such as mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products on the camera lens itself. The visibility is quite good and shows a road scene during twilight or early evening hours with no signs of smudges or distortions that would typically indicate a covered or damaged lens. However, the image does exhibit motion blur, which is likely due to the low light conditions and the movement of the vehicle from which the photo was taken, rather than any obstruction on the camera.
