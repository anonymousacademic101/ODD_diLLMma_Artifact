NO

The image does not show signs of obstruction, cover, or damage by mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products on the camera lens. The view appears relatively clear and unobstructed. The blurriness in the center seems to be due to glare, possibly from sunlight reflecting off the windshield through which the photo was taken.
