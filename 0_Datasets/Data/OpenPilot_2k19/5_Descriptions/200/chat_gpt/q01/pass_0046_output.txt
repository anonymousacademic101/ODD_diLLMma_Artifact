The image appears relatively clear and shows no signs of obstructions due to mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products on the camera lens. Although there is some blurring, likely caused by a combination of motion and perhaps slight smudges on the windshield or camera lens, this does not indicate the type of severe obstruction mentioned in the question. The scene is visible, with details like vehicles, road markings, and buildings being quite discernible.
