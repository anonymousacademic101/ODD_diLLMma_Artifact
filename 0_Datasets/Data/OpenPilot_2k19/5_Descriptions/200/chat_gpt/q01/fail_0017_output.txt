YES

The image quality is significantly compromised, which suggests something is obscuring the lens. While I can't explicitly determine the substance from the image alone, the blurry, smeared, and washed-out appearance is consistent with some form of obstruction on the camera's lens, such as water spots or a thin layer of another translucent material, which could include any of the mentioned substances like mud, ice, or snow, although it's not possible to specify which without further context or information.
