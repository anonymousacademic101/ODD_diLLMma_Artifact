There are no obvious artifacts on the image's surface that would indicate such conditions. The blurriness and glare seen in the photo are more likely due to low light conditions, possible camera movement, and the headlights of oncoming cars rather than an obstruction on the camera lens."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
