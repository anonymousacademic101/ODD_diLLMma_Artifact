The image appears to be taken through a vehicle's windshield, with a reflection visible across the middle of the image. The overall clarity of the photo does not seem to be significantly affected by mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products. Instead, the main issue seems to be the reflection which can occur under normal circumstances when light reflects off of smooth surfaces like glass.
