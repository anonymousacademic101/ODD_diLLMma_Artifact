The visual artifacts present in the image seem to be due to lens flare caused by the sun's position relative to the camera, which is a common occurrence when photographing or filming directly into a light source. The rest of the scene is reasonably clear and no obstructions are visible on the lens itself."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
