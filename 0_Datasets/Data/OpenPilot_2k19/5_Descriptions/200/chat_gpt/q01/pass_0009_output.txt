NO

The image appears clear with no evidence of obstruction due to mud, ice, snow, paint, or adhesives. The low light and potential high ISO setting used to capture the image in dim lighting conditions may cause digital noise and decreased image sharpness, which can sometimes be mistaken for obstructions on the lens. However, there are no visible smears, splatters, or significant distortions that would suggest the camera lens itself was compromised by the substances mentioned.
