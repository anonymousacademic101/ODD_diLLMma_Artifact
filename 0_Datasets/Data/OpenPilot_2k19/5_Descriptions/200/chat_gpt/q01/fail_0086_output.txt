YES

The image shows signs of distortion and blurriness, especially around the edges, which are indicative of an obstruction or residue on the camera's lens. The center of the image is relatively clear, but the perimeter exhibits a blurry, smeared effect consistent with something obscuring the camera, like a semi-transparent material or residue that has been partially wiped away.
