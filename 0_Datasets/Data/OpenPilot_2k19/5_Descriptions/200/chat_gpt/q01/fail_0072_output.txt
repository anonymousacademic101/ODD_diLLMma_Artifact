The image appears blurry and lacks clarity, which can be indicative of an obstruction on the camera lens, such as mud, ice, snow, or some kind of coating that is affecting image quality. While the exact nature of the obstruction isn't clear, the degradation of image quality suggests that the camera lens was not in its optimal condition when this photo was taken.
