YES

The image has a blurry appearance, indicative of some kind of obstruction on the lens of the camera, leading to the diffusion of light and lack of sharp details throughout the image. This effect could be caused by a layer of dust, moisture, or a subtle film of some other substance like mud or ice on the camera lens. Although it's not extreme, it does seem that something is mildly distorting the clarity of the image.
