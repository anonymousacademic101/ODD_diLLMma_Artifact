NO

The image does not show clear signs that the camera was obstructed by mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products. The overall blurriness and low-light conditions are indicative of a camera taking a picture in early dusk/dawn or with lower exposure, not necessarily signs of an obstruction. There could be a slight glare or reflections on a windshield if the picture was taken from inside a vehicle, which could affect image clarity, but these are not the same as the obstructions you specified.
