NO

The image appears blurry and noisy, which could be a result of poor lighting conditions and motion blur due to the movement of the car, rather than the camera being obstructed, covered, or damaged by substances such as mud, ice, snow, or excessive paint or adhesive products. The overall smooth blur pattern suggests camera or subject movement rather than an obstruction on the lens. There are no clear signs of any such substances on the lens in the image provided.
