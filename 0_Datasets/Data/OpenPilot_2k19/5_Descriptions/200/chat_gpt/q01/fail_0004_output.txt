YES

The image appears blurry and has artifacts consistent with some type of obstruction on the camera lens. This could be due to a dirty windshield or lens, as the blurriness is uniform across the image. It doesn't necessarily indicate damage to the camera itself, but rather that something is obstructing the view, such as a thin layer of dirt or condensation.
