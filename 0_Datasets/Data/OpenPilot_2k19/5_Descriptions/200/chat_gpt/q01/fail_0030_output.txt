NO

The camera appears to have captured the image through a windshield that has some spots on it. These spots may be due to water droplets, light dirt, or a similar substance. However, it does not look like the camera itself was obstructed or covered by a heavy substance like mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products that would significantly obstruct or damage the lens. The image is relatively clear with only minor distortions that seem to come from the windshield, not the camera.
