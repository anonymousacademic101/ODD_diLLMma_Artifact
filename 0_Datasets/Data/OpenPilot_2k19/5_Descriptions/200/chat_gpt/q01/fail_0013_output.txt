The image has blotches and streaks that suggest something is on the camera lens or the windshield through which the photo was taken. These marks could be due to dirt, water smears, or another substance that causes a similar obscured effect, but not necessarily mud, ice, snow, excessive paint or adhesive products. The disruptions to the clarity of the image indicate something is affecting the camera's ability to capture a clear picture.
