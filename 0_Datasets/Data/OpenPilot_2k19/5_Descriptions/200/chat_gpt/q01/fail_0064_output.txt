The image appears to be taken through a medium that is causing a diffuse and hazy quality, suggesting the presence of a translucent or semi-opaque substance on the camera lens or the glass through which the photo was taken. This could be consistent with an obstruction like a layer of mud, ice, snow, or an adhesive substance, although it is not possible to definitively determine the exact cause. Nevertheless, the quality of the image is notably affected by this apparent obstruction.
