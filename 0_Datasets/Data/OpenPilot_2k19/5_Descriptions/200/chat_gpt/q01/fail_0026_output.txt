NO

The image appears to be taken at night, possibly from inside a vehicle, which can explain the granularity and glare seen due to low lighting conditions. There are no obvious signs of obstruction, covering, or damage from mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products that can be clearly discerned from the image provided. The speckles visible in the image resemble noise commonly seen in low-light photography and is likely due to the camera's sensitivity (ISO) being increased to capture the image in a dark environment, which can also make the image appear grainy.
