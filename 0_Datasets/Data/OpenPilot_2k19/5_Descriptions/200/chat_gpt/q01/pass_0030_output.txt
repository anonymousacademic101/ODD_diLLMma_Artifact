NO

The camera was not obstructed, covered, or damaged by mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products. The blurriness and light streaks visible in this image are more likely due to the camera's movement or shaking while the photo was taken, potentially from a moving vehicle given the context of the image showing traffic at night. Additionally, low light conditions often result in reduced image sharpness and clarity, particularly if a mobile phone or a camera with a small sensor was used. Therefore, the quality of the photo is affected by these factors rather than any physical obstruction on the lens.
