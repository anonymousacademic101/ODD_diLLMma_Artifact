YES

The reason for my affirmative answer is that the image provided displays noticeable smudges and streaks across the field of vision, which are indicative of some kind of obstruction on the camera lens. These markings could be consistent with residue or smearing from substances such as mud, water, or another non-transparent material that has partially dried or is smeared across the surface. This indicates that the clarity of the camera lens was indeed compromised at the time the image was taken, affecting the overall image quality.
