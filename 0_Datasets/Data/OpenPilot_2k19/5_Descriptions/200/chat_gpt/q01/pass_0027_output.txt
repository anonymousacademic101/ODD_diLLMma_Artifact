YES

The camera that took this image shows evidence of obstruction, as indicated by the spots all over the image. These spots could be due to water droplets, dirt, or another substance on the camera lens or protective cover, which is consistent with a kind of obstruction. This can occur, for example, when taking a photo from inside a vehicle through a dirty windshield, which seems to be the case here.
