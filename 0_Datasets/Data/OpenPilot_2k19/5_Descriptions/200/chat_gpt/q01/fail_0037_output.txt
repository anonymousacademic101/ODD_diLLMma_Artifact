YES

The image appears blurry and there are specks scattered throughout the view, suggesting that the camera lens could be dirty or that the image was taken through a glass (like a windshield) that has debris or dirt on it, which can cause such visual artifacts. This doesn't necessarily confirm the presence of mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products specifically, but implies that there is some form of obstruction affecting the image quality.
