NO

The image appears clear with objects, vehicles, and road markings visible and identifiable, suggesting there is no substantial obstruction, coverage, or damage by mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products to the camera lens. There are some reflections and light streaks which are common in images taken through glass, especially at night with light sources present, but these do not indicate the camera itself is obstructed, covered, or damaged.
