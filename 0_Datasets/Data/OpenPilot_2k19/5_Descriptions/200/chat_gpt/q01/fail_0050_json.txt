The haziness could be due to a variety of reasons, such as moisture, fog on the windshield, reflection of the car's interior lights, or simply being out of focus. The lack of clear obstructions such as smears or blotches that are typically associated with substances like mud or paint suggests that the camera itself is not directly covered by such materials."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
