The blurriness and the pattern of distortion, especially noticeable on the edges and corners of the image, suggest that the camera lens was not directly exposed to the scene but was instead obstructed by an intervening layer that is likely dirty or smeared, which could be from substances like mud, ice, snow, or possibly an adhesive product smeared over the camera's protective cover or windshield."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
