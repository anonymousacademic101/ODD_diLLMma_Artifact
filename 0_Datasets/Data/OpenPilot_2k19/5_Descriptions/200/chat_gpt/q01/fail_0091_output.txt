The image appears clear with no signs of obstruction, covering, or damage from such substances. The visibility is good, the details of the scene (such as cars, trees, and road) are discernable, and there are no noticeable marks or distortions that would suggest the camera was compromised by mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, adhesive products, or any similar obstruction on the lens.
