YES

The image shows signs of distortion and blurriness, suggesting that there is something on the camera lens or cover that is partially obstructing the view. This could be consistent with a light coating of mud, ice, snow, or some form of residue that is not entirely opaque, as it doesn't completely block the view but does diffuse and blur the captured image.
