However, there are some artifacts indicative of water droplets on the lens or a translucent material (more likely water due to the irregular pattern and light refraction) overlaying the camera, but none of these suggest mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products that would obstruct, cover, or damage the vision to a great extent. The general clarity and sharpness of the image suggest that the camera lens was not significantly compromised.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
