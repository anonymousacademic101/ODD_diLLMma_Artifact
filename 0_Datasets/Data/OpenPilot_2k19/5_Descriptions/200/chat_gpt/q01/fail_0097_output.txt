YES

The blurriness and lack of clarity in the image suggests that the camera lens was obstructed. While I cannot confirm the specific substance, the inconsistency and smudge-like appearance are indicative of a lens that may have been covered or smeared by something like dirt, water marks, or another substance that is not necessarily as heavy as mud, ice, snow, excessive paint or adhesive products but it's causing a similar visual obstruction.
