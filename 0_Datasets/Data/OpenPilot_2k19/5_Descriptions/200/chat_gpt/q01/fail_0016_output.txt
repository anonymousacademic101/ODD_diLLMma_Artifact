YES

The image shows signs of blur and streaks of light, which are indicative of an obstruction on the camera lens. While I can't be certain of the exact cause (mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products), the image appears to be taken through a windshield with water or another translucent substance on it, which is scattering light and causing distortions in the image. These effects are consistent with a camera lens that has been partially obstructed, although the specific nature of the obstruction cannot be determined beyond reasonable doubt from this image alone.
