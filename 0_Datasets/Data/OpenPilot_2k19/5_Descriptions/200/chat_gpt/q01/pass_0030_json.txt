The blurriness and light streaks visible in this image are more likely due to the camera's movement or shaking while the photo was taken, potentially from a moving vehicle given the context of the image showing traffic at night. Additionally, low light conditions often result in reduced image sharpness and clarity, particularly if a mobile phone or a camera with a small sensor was used. Therefore, the quality of the photo is affected by these factors rather than any physical obstruction on the lens."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
