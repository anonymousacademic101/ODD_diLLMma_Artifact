NO

The quality of the image suggests that there might be a layer of something on the windshield through which the image was taken, but it does not provide clear evidence that the camera itself was obstructed, covered, or damaged. The blurriness could be due to moisture (like fog or mist) on the windshield, not necessarily on the camera lens. Without further information, we can't definitively say the camera itself was compromised.
