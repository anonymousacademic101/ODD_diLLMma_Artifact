The image seems rather to be affected by reflections, possibly from the inside of a car, given the appearance of the dashboard. The reflections likely come from glass, plastic, or other reflective surfaces inside the vehicle, obscuring parts of the view outside. There are no apparent signs of mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products directly obstructing, covering, or damaging the camera's lens itself.
