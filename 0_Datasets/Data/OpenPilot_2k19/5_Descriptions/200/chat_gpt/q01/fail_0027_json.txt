The haziness and lack of clarity in the image are likely due to the low light conditions rather than the camera being obstructed or covered by substances like mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products. Low light conditions can result in grainy, poorly illuminated, and blurry images, which seems to be the case here. There are no obvious signs of physical obstructions on the camera lens, such as splatters or marks that one would typically associate with such substances."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
