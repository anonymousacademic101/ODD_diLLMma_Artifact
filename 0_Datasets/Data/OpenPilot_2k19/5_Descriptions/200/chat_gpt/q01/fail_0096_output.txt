The image provided shows signs of blurriness and distortion consistent with a camera having an obstructed or dirty lens. This can be caused by substances such as mud, ice, snow, or other residues covering a portion of the lens. In real-world scenarios, this often happens when a camera is mounted on a vehicle and the lens becomes dirty due to exposure to the elements. The obstructions donâ€™t have to be excessive to cause this effect; even a thin layer of dirt or residue can blur the image. The presence of a smeared or hazy quality in the image is a clear indicator that the camera lens was not clean when the photo was taken.
