The scene is relatively clear and details like the road marking, other vehicles, and road signs are visible. The quality of the image suggests that it was taken in low-light conditions, possibly at night, which can explain the presence of noise or grain in the image and some lens flare from the vehicle lights. These effects are common in low-light photography and do not indicate that the camera was obstructed or damaged.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
