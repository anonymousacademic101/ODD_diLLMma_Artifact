NO.

The camera itself does not appear to be obstructed, covered, or damaged by mud, ice, snow, excessive paint or adhesive products. However, there is an obstruction in the image that seems to be due to the positioning of the camera behind a structure, most likely a windshield wiper blade or a part of the vehicle's frame, which is giving the appearance of something crossing the scene in the foreground. This would typically happen if a camera is mounted inside a vehicle and captures part of the vehicle in the shot.
