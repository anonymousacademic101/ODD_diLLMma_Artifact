NO

The camera does not appear to be obstructed, covered, or damaged by mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products. Instead, the blurriness and graininess of the image could be due to low light conditions combined with motion, likely taken from a moving vehicle, causing the camera to have a longer exposure time, which makes the image look blurry. There's no evidence of any foreign substance on the lens from the image provided.
