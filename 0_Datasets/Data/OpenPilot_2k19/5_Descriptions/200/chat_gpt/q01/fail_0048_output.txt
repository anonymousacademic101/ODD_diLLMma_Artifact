YES

The image appears blurry, which suggests that there might be something on the camera's lens. Such obstructions may include condensation, smudges, or a semi-transparent material that allows some light through but distorts the clarity of the image. This can happen when a camera is behind a dirty windshield, for example. The presence of a dashboard at the bottom of the image provides context that indicates the camera was likely inside a vehicle, which lends support to the idea that the image quality may be affected by the cleanliness of the windshield through which it was taken.
