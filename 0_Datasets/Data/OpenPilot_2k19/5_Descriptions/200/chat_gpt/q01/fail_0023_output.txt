NO

The image appears to have been taken in low-light conditions resulting in some blurriness and graininess, common for low-light photography. This does not necessarily indicate that the camera was obstructed, covered, or damaged by external substances like mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products. It simply seems to be a case of low visibility due to the conditions in which the photo was taken. There are no obvious signs of smearing, cracks, or distortions that would suggest an obstruction on the camera lens.
