NO.

The quality of the image does seem impaired, but the impairment appears to be due to motion blur and low lighting, which are common issues when taking photographs at night or of fast-moving objects with a camera in motion, rather than an obstruction covering the camera lens. There are no visible signs of mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products on the lens itself.
