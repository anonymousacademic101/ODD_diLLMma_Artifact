However, there is an obstruction in the image that seems to be due to the positioning of the camera behind a structure, most likely a windshield wiper blade or a part of the vehicle's frame, which is giving the appearance of something crossing the scene in the foreground. This would typically happen if a camera is mounted inside a vehicle and captures part of the vehicle in the shot."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
