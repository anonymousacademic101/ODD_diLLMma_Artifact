YES

The image appears to be taken through a glass that has some form of obstruction giving it a blurry and unclear look. While I cannot assert the exact nature of the material causing the obstruction, it does seem like something may be obscuring the camera's view, potentially a substance resembling mud or dirt commonly found on vehicle windshields or windows. This reasoning comes from the patterns and distribution of the blurriness across the image, which are consistent with something smeared on a transparent surface through which the photo was taken.
