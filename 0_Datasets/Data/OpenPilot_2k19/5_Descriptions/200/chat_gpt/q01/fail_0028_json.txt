The indistinct quality of the image seems to be due to low-light conditions, which can result in grainy, underexposed photographs if the camera's sensor doesn't perform well in such environments. Alternatively, it could be due to motion blur if the camera or subjects were moving, a lens that was not focused correctly, or the use of a low-quality camera. No signs of physical obstruction to the camera lens, such as smears or chunks of material, are evident in the image."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
