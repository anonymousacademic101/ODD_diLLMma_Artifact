The blurriness and glare seem more consistent with a photograph taken through a windshield with moisture or condensation, or possibly a dirty or smeared surface, rather than the presence of the obstructive materials listed. However, without evidence of the condition of the camera itself, I cannot definitively determine the cause of the image quality.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
