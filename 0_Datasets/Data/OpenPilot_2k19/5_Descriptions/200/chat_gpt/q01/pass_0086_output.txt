The image appears to show a relatively clear scene of a road with vehicles. While there is a glare caused by sunlight, typically expected when shooting against the light, there's no evident sign of obstruction, covering, or damage caused by mud, ice, snow, or excessive paint/adhesive products on the camera lens itself. The glare and reduced contrast seen in the image seem to be due to the angle of the sun relative to the camera, a common issue in photography known as lens flare or glare, rather than something obstructing the camera.
