There are no visible distortions or markings that would indicate damage or obstruction from these substances. The view is slightly darkened around the edges, but this is likely due to the camera being placed behind a windshield, as indicated by the hood of the car and the dashboard in the lower part of the image, rather than any substance on the camera lens itself.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
