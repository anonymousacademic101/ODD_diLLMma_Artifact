The image provided does not exhibit the telltale signs of obstruction, such as significant blurring, smearing, or discoloration that would be suggestive of mud, ice, snow, paint, adhesive products, or other foreign substances on the lens. Instead, what can be seen is a clear, although slightly dark, image of a street scene with no evidence of distortion that would indicate damage to the camera's lens or covering.
