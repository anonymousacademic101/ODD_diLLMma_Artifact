This image has areas that appear blurry and obstructed, which is consistent with something being on the camera lens. The smears and blurry spots suggest that the camera lens could have been partially covered or obstructed by a substance such as mud or another form of dirt. However, without a closer inspection it is difficult to determine the exact nature of the obstruction, or if it might be a case of condensation or smudging from something like ice, snow, or a casual touch rather than mud, paint, or adhesive products.
