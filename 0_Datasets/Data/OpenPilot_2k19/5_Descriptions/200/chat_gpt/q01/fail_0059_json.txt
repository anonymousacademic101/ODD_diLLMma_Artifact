This effect could be caused by a layer of dust, moisture, or a subtle film of some other substance like mud or ice on the camera lens. Although it's not extreme, it does seem that something is mildly distorting the clarity of the image."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
