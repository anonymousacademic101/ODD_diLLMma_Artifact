YES

The image provided exhibits qualities consistent with an obstruction on the camera's lens. There are streaks and blurring effects which suggest that there may be something on the lens such as water droplets, smudges, or another translucent material causing scattering of the light and resulting in distorted image quality. It is difficult to specifically determine the nature of the obstruction without more context, but the quality of the image is certainly affected in a manner that suggests an obstruction of some sort.
