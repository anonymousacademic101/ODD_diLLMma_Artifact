While it's not possible to confirm the exact substance, the obstruction seems similar to what could be caused by a smear of mud, ice, snow, or another substance that would distort the clarity of the image. This indicates that whatever is on the lens is adversely affecting the ability to capture a clear and unobstructed image."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
