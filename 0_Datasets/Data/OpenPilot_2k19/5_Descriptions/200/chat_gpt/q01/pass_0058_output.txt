The image appears clear without signs of obstruction, covering, or damage from substances like mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products. The visibility of the road, lane markings, and lights from vehicles are not impeded by such obstructions. The nighttime setting and lighting conditions account for the darker appearance and lower visibility but this does not suggest the camera was compromised by the aforementioned factors.
