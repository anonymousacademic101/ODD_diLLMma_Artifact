The image quality does not appear to be affected by mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products on the camera itself. However, there is significant glare from the lights of the vehicles, which may indicate that the camera lens could be dirty, the windshield through which the photo was likely taken could be dirty, or that the lighting conditions are poor for photography, but there's no clear evidence of the specific types of obstruction you've mentioned like mud, ice, snow, paint, or adhesives.
