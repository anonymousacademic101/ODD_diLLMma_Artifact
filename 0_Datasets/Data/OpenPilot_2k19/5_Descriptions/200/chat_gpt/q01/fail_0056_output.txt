The image appears to be reasonably clear and does not evidently show signs of obstruction, coverage, or damage by mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products. It looks like a typical photo captured at night with some lens flare from the street and vehicle lights, which could slightly impair the clarity but does not indicate the camera itself was compromised by the substances mentioned.
