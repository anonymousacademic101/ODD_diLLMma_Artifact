The image seems to have been taken in low-light conditions, likely at night, and appears hazy. This could be due to fog, mist, or a low-quality camera sensor struggling in low-light conditions, not necessarily because of an obstruction or damage. There are no clear signs of mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products obstructing the camera lens.
