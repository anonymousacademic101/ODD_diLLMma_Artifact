The image appears hazy, possibly due to a dirty windshield through which the photo seems to have been taken, rather than the camera itself being obstructed, covered, or damaged. It is common for a car's windshield to accumulate dust, pollen, or other fine particles that can create a diffused, foggy, or smudged appearance in photographs taken from inside the vehicle. The quality of the image might also be affected by the lighting conditions at the time the photo was taken.
