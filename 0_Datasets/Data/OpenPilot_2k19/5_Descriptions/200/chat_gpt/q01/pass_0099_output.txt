NO

The image shows a view through a windshield with a blurry area at the bottom. The blurriness appears to be due to the camera being out of focus, or possibly capturing the dash reflection rather than an obstruction like mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products. The top portion of the image is clear and shows the road, vehicles, traffic lights, and surroundings with no signs of obstructions on the lens itself.
