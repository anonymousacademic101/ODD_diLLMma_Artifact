The image appears darkened and bluish, indicating a possible obstruction or filter over the lens, such as a dark tint. This is not typically a result of damage, but rather a choice of filter, camera setting, or an obstruction that could be reducing light transmission and altering color balance, resembling the effect of a neutral density or tinted filter. There is no visible mud, ice, snow, paint, or adhesive products directly on the camera lens, so the cause may be something like tinted glass or a camera setting, rather than these specific substances.
