NO

The image does not provide evidence of the camera being obstructed, covered, or damaged by mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products. The blurriness and light streaks seen in the image are more likely due to motion blur caused by a moving vehicle, low lighting conditions, and possibly a dirty windshield through which the picture was taken, rather than direct obstruction, cover, or damage to the camera itself.
