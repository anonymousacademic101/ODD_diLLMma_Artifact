The image appears hazy and has some glare around the lights, which can be indicative of a dirty camera lens or shooting through a windshield in need of cleaning. However, there's no clear evidence of the camera itself being obstructed or covered by mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products. Instead, the blurriness may be due to a low quality camera, poor focus, or shooting in a low light environment without proper camera settings, creating a grainy or noisy image with lens flare.
