YES

The image appears to have a blurry and diffuse quality, indicating that something is obscuring the camera lens. The obscurity seems consistent with a layer of material over the lens, such as a thin film of mud, dust, or condensation, rather than being focused or clear which might indicate a damage to the lens or camera itself. This results in a lack of sharpness and detail in the image, suggesting that the camera's view was indeed obstructed when the photo was taken.
