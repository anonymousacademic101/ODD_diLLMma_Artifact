NO

The image is clear and details are visible without any obvious signs of obstruction, coverage, or damage by mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products. There may be a slight blur or smudging effect towards the bottom of the image, which could be due to a dirty or smudged windshield, but this does not indicate that the camera itself was affected by such substances in a way that significantly impairs the image quality.
