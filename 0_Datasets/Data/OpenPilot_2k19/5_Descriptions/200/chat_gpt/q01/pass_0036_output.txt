The image provided has a highly grainy and noisy appearance, especially noticeable in the dark areas, which could imply that the camera lens might have been partially covered or obstructed, or that the sensor was dealing with a low-light situation and increased the ISO setting, thus creating the noise in the image. However, the exact cause of the grainy texture, whether it was due to an obstruction or camera settings, cannot be determined with certainty without more information.
