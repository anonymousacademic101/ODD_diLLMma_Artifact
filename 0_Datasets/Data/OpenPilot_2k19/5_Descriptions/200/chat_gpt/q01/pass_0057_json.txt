However, the type of obstruction you've specified such as mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products do not seem to be present since there is no visible texture or material covering the lens that would indicate such specific substances. The view is relatively clear and the colors and objects in the distance are recognizable, suggesting that the camera itself was not significantly obstructed by such materials. The impairment seems relatively light, potentially from a smudge or light glare, but not seriously damaged or covered by the materials listed."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
