The blurriness and poor image quality can be attributed to other factors such as low lighting conditions, high ISO setting leading to image noise, motion blur, or simply an unfocused shot. The absence of visual distortions that typically arise from substances like mud, ice, or paint on the lens suggests that the camera lens was clear of such obstructions at the time the image was taken.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
