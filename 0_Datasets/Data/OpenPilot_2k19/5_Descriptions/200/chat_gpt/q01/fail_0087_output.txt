NO

The camera does not appear to have been obstructed, covered, or damaged by mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products. The image quality seems to be affected predominantly by backlighting from the sun, which is causing lens flare and a decrease in the contrast of the image. The direct sunlight is overpowering the camera's dynamic range, not physical obstructions on the camera lens.
