NO

The road shown in the image does not appear to be on a sharp curve. There is a slight bend to the left indicated by the road markings, but it is not sharp. A sharp curve would generally show a more pronounced change in direction within a shorter distance, and the lane markings would typically indicate a tighter turn. Here, the road markings suggest a slight curve or a merge, rather than a sharp turn.
