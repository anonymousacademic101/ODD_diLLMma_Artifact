The curve doesn't seem to require a significant change in direction immediately, which would be characteristic of a sharp curve. Instead, the road ahead appears to veer gradually, suggesting a less abrupt turn. However, due to the nighttime conditions and limited visibility, the full extent of the curve cannot be fully ascertained from the photograph alone."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
