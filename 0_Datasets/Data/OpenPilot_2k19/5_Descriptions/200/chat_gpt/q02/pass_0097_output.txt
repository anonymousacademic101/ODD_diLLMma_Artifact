NO.

The image shows a road that appears to be rather straight. From the perspective given, there is no evidence of a sharp curve; instead, the road ahead has a slight bend which cannot be classified as a sharp curve. Sharp curves often have clear warnings and more dramatic changes in direction, which do not seem to be present in this image.
