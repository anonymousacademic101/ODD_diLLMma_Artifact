Instead, the road seems to go straight forward with only a slight curve to the right at the distant end, which does not qualify as a sharp curve. A sharp curve is typically indicated by road signs and a dramatic change in the road's direction, which is not evident here."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
