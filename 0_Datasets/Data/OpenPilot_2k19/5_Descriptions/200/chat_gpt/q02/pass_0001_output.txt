The image shows a view from inside a vehicle stopped at an intersection, based on the presence of traffic signals, pedestrian crossings, and other cars moving straight or turning at the intersection.

Sharp curves are often indicated by warning signs, road markings, or visible curvature of the road, none of which are present in this image.
