NO.

The image appears to show a vehicle that is either parked or stopped with the dashboard visible at the bottom of the frame. Beyond the vehicle, there are lights and other cars, but they are not presented in a manner that suggests movement or the path of the road. There is no clear depiction of a road curving sharply in front of the vehicle. Instead, the view is somewhat obscured and does not provide enough visual information to determine the curvature of any road that might be there.
