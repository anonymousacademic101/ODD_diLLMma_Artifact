Instead, it looks like there are multiple lanes at an intersection with road markings that suggest turns and straight paths. The curve that can be perceived is likely part of a turn lane or a gentle bend as part of the intersection design, not a sharp curve in the road. The bright road markings and the context of the traffic signals and signs suggest that this is an intersection rather than a sharp bend in the road.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
