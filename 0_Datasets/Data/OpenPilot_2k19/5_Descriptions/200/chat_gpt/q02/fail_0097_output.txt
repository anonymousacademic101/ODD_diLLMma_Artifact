The road visible through the vehicle's windshield shows a significant bend to the left, which can be classified as a sharp curve. This is indicated by the visible curvature of the road's edge and the direction in which the road is disappearing from view. Additionally, the road signs that typically accompany a sharp curve might not be visible in the image, but the maneuver required to continue on the road indicates a sharp curve ahead.
