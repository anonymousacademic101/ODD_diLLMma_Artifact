NO.

The road ahead appears to have a moderate curve to the right rather than a sharp curve. The curve doesn't seem to be abrupt or tight based on the road markings and the visible surroundings in the image. Sharp curves typically require signage to warn drivers of the need for a significant reduction in speed, and this road appears to transition into the curve with a gentler bend.
