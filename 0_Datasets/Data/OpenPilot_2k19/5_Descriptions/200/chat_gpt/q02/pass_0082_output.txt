The image shows a stretch of road at night that appears to be curving gently to the right. The curve does not appear sharp based on the road markings and the visible trajectory of the lane lines. The road surface is mostly visible in the headlightsâ€™ reach and the curve seems wide, suggesting a broad turning radius, which is not indicative of a sharp curve. Sharp curves typically require significant steering adjustments and are often indicated by warning signs or additional road markings, none of which are evident in this image.
