Based on the image provided, the road ahead appears to be relatively straight with a slight curve to the right. The term "sharp curve" is generally used to describe a more abrupt or severe change in direction, which does not seem to be the case in this image. The road markers and the alignment of the vehicles on the road suggest a gentle curve rather than a sharp one.
