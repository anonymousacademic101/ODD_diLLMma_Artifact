NO.

The road ahead appears to gently curve to the right, but the bend does not seem to be sharp. The trajectory of the light trails from the street lamps and headlights suggests a moderate curve rather than a sharp turn. Additionally, there are no sharp curve warning signs or signals indicating the presence of a sharp curve.
