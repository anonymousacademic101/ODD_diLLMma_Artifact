The white lane markings visible in the image appear to be relatively straight and do not indicate a sharp curve in the road. The road looks to maintain a predominantly straight trajectory as far as can be seen with the illumination provided by the vehicle's headlights and other ambient sources. Sharp curves in a road are generally indicated by a series of more drastic changes in the direction of the lane markings, which are not observed here.
