The image shows a vehicle stopped on a road that appears to be relatively straight, with no visible sharp curves ahead. There are buildings on the left side, trees on both sides, and the road seems to continue straight beyond the stoppage of vehicles. The perspective and limited view do not indicate a sharp curve.
