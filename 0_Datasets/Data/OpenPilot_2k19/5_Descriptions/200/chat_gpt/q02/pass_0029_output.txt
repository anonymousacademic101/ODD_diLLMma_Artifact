NO

The road in the image does not appear to be on a sharp curve. The lanes visible in the image are quite straight and the vehicles do not seem to be making any abrupt turns that would indicate a sharp bend in the road. Additionally, the lane markings are parallel and do not curve sharply, further implying that the road is not on a sharp curve at this point.
