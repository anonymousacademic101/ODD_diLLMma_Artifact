NO.

The road in the image appears relatively straight with a gentle bend rather than a sharp curve. The lanes are well marked and do not indicate a significant change in direction that would be characteristic of a sharp curve. Additionally, the movement of traffic suggests a normal traffic flow that one would not typically associate with a sharp curve, where you might expect to see brake lights and reduced speeds.
