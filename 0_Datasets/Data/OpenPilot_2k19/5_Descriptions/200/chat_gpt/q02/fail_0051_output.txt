NO.

The image shows the view from a vehicle that appears to be entering an intersection rather than navigating a sharp curve. The lanes visible in the picture suggest that traffic movement is oriented for crossing the intersection straight ahead, with other vehicles positioned to move in various directions typical of such an area. A sharp curve would typically be indicated by a bend in the road with appropriate lane markings leading into the curve, which are not evident in this image.
