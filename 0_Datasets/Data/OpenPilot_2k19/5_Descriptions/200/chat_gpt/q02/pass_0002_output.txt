NO.

The lane markings and the visible road signs ahead suggest that the road is relatively straight in the section immediately in view. There are no signs of a sharp curve in the visible portion of the road. Sharp curves are typically indicated by a series of short, dashed lane markings or warning signs, neither of which are present in this image. Additionally, the headlights of oncoming vehicles and the red tail lights of vehicles ahead appear to be aligned in a way that suggests a straight or gently curving road rather than a sharp bend.
