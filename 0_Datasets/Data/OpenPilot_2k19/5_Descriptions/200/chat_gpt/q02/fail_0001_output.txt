NO.

The image provided does not show the vehicle driving on a road, sharp curve or otherwise. Instead, we see the vehicle appears to be facing a building with garage-type doors and a fence, possibly in a parking lot or drive-through area, and the immediate foreground does not indicate a sharp curve in the path of the vehicle.
