NO

The image doesn't indicate that we are on a sharp curve. Instead, we appear to be on a straight road or parking area, looking at a stationary scene with parked cars and a building with a "Target" sign in the background. The orientation of the vehicles and the straight lines in the parking lot do not suggest a sharp curve in the road.
