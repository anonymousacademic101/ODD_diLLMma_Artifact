The road itself does not appear to be a sharp curve. Instead, the image suggests that the vehicle is either in a parking lot or a drive-through lane, characterized by the proximity to the building and the presence of another car waiting in line. Sharp curves in roads typically do not occur in such settings, which are designed for slower, controlled vehicle movement.
