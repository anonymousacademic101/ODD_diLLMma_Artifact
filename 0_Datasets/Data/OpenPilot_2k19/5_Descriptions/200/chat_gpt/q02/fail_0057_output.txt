The road ahead in the image appears to be straight since the vehicles are aligned in a straight manner, and the lane markings visible ahead also suggest a straight path rather than a sharp curve. Additionally, the brake lights of the vehicles ahead are illuminated indicating a stop or slow movement in a traffic queue, not necessarily related to navigating a curve.
