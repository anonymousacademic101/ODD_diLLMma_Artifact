The road looks to maintain a predominantly straight trajectory as far as can be seen with the illumination provided by the vehicle's headlights and other ambient sources. Sharp curves in a road are generally indicated by a series of more drastic changes in the direction of the lane markings, which are not observed here."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
