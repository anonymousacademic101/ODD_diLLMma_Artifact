NO.

The photo appears to have been taken in a parking lot with regular curves and lanes meant for vehicular traffic within the lot, not on a sharp curve of a public roadway. The angle of the turn ahead does not suggest an immediate or sharp curve but rather a gentle turn, common in parking areas for navigation around the lot.
