The image shown does not depict a sharp curve in a road; instead, it appears to be a lineup of vehicles in a drive-thru lane at a quick-service restaurant. The visible lane markings are consistent with the layout typically found in such a drive-thru, where cars queue in single file to place and pick up orders, rather than a public road designed for traveling between destinations.
