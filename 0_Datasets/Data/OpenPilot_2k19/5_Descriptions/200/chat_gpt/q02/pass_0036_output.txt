NO.

The road depicted in the image is not on a sharp curve. The visible lane markings appear to proceed straight ahead, with no indication of a sudden turn or bend. The road may curve gently beyond the scope of the headlight illumination or there might be a slight bend not easily visible in the darkness, but from what can be seen, it does not constitute a sharp curve. Additionally, there is a road sign on the right which typically indicates a side road or a junction ahead rather than a sharp curve.
