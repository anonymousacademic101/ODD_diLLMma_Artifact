The road ahead does not appear to be a sharp curve. The lanes on the road are curving gently to the left, but the curvature does not seem severe enough to be considered a sharp curve. It looks more like a slight bend or a normal curve in a highway or a road, where vehicles can still maintain a regular speed without the need for significant deceleration.
