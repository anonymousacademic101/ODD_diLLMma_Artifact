The road ahead appears to be relatively straight with a slight bend to the right, which does not constitute a sharp curve. A sharp curve would suggest a more immediate and acute angle in the road's direction, requiring a significant reduction in speed and careful maneuvering, which does not seem necessary in this scenario based on the visible road conditions.
