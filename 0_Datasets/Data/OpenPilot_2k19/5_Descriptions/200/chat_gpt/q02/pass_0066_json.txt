The lane markings are parallel and do not show signs of a sharp curve. The highway overhead signs are also oriented for drivers moving in a straight path, which is typical for highways or straightforward sections of a road. Moreover, there is no significant bending of the road visible in the headlights, suggesting that the road continues straight ahead within the visible distance.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
