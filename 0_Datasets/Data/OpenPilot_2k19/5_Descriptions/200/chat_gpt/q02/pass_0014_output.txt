The image presented appears to be a drive-through lane at a fast-food restaurant, not a road with a sharp curve. The lane does have a curve as indicated by the yellow arrow on the ground, but it's a gentle curve typical of a drive-through path designed for vehicles to navigate easily at low speeds. The term "sharp curve" generally refers to a more abrupt change in direction that would be found on roads where higher speeds could make navigating such a turn more challenging.
