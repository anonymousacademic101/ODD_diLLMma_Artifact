The image appears to be showing a parking lot, not a road with a sharp curve. The orientation of parked cars and parking stalls suggests a stationary environment designed for parking, rather than a road designed for through traffic. The pavement markings also indicate parking spaces rather than road lanes that would curve sharply.
