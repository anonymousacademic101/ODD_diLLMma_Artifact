The curve does not appear sharp based on the road markings and the visible trajectory of the lane lines. The road surface is mostly visible in the headlightsâ€™ reach and the curve seems wide, suggesting a broad turning radius, which is not indicative of a sharp curve. Sharp curves typically require significant steering adjustments and are often indicated by warning signs or additional road markings, none of which are evident in this image.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
