The image shows a queue of vehicles, with the tail lights of the car in front indicating that it is braking. The visible road markings appear straight, and the orientation of the vehicles suggests that any curve present is not sharp, given the organization of the cars in what seems to be a traffic jam. The road ahead appears to curve slightly to the right, but not sharply based on the information available in the image.
