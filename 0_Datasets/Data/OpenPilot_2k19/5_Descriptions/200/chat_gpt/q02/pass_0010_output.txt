NO

The road visible in the image does not exhibit characteristics of a sharp curve. The lanes appear to be straight and there is no visible turning or bending of the road within the scope of the image. Sharp curves typically require visible adjustments in driving direction, often marked by warning signs or different road markings, none of which are apparent here.
