NO.

The road ahead does not appear to be a sharp curve. The lanes seem to be straight with slight bends visible in the far distance, but nothing suggesting an immediate sharp curve. The vehicles are travelling in straight paths, and there are no road signs or markings indicating a sharp curve ahead.
