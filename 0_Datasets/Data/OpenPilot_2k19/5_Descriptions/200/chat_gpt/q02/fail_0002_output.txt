NO.

The road ahead, as seen through the windshield, is curving gently to the right rather than being a sharp curve. A sharp curve would generally indicate a more immediate and acute change in direction, which is not evident in this scene. The curve here appears smooth and navigable at a standard driving speed suggesting it is not a sharp curve.
