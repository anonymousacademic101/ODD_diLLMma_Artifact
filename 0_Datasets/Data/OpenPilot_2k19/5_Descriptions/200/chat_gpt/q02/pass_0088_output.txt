The road ahead is not showing a sharp curve. It bends gently to the right, and the road markings and signage visible in the image suggest a wide, sweeping turn rather than a sharp curve. Additionally, the vehicles on the road are not positioned or angled in a manner that would indicate a sharp curve ahead.
