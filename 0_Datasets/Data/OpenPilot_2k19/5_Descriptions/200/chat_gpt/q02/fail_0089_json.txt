The lines in the road indicate a straight path leading into an underpass, and the visible road markers and signage do not suggest an immediate sharp curve ahead. The curve that is visible is gentle rather than sharp, and it is not the road we are on but rather an adjacent road or off-ramp. The environment around the straight road, including the trees and shadows, does not indicate any sharp turn in the road being driven on.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
