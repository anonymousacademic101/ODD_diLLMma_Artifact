NO.

The road ahead appears to be relatively straight with a slight curve. The lane markings are not indicative of a sharp curve, and the vehicles ahead are not positioned as they would be if navigating a sharp turn. There is no significant change in the direction of the road within the visible stretch in the image. Sharp curves are typically characterized by more dramatic changes in road direction which are not evident here.
