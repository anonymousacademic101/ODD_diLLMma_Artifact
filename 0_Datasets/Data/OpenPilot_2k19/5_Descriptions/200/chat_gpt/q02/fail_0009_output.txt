We are not on a road; this appears to be a drive-thru lane next to a building, typically at a fast-food restaurant or similar establishment, which is designed for cars to queue and order food without leaving their vehicles. The vehicle ahead is stationary, and there's a menu board to the right, common features of a drive-thru lane.
