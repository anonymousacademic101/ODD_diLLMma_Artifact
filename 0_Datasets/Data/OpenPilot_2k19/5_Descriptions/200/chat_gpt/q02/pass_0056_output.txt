The road ahead appears to be relatively straight where we can see it; however, this image doesn't provide a full long-distance view which might reveal a curve further ahead. The vehicles are aligned in a straight manner, and no sharp curve warning signs or road markings indicative of a sharp curve are evident in the immediate field of view.
