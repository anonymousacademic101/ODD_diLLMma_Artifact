The layout of the street visible through the windshield suggests that the road continues straight ahead, and other vehicles can be seen driving in a linear path as well. There are no visible signs of a sharp bend in the road from this perspective. The presence of traffic lights and a cross street ahead indicate an intersection.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
