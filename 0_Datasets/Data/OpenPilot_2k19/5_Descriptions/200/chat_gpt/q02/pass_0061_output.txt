From the image provided, the road appears to be relatively straight in the immediate view. The lanes and road markings continue in a straight line into the distance, without signs of a sharp curve ahead. However, visibility is limited, and it is always important to pay attention to road signs and signals that might indicate changes in the road's direction that are not visible due to the darkness or conditions such as fog.
