NO.

The road in the image seems to be relatively straight within the visible stretch, without any sharp curves apparent. The traffic flow is normal, and the vehicles are aligned in a straight manner, indicating no immediate sharp turn on the road. However, the image does not show what lies beyond the visible area, so while it's clear that there is no sharp curve in the immediate vicinity, there could potentially be one further ahead that is not visible in the photo.
