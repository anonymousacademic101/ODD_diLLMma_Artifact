NO.

The road ahead does not show a sharp curve, it appears to be a straight section of a road with a slight turn to the left. The view is not indicative of a sharp curve but rather a gentle curve or a bend, if at all. Sharp curves usually have signs indicating a high degree of turn, which are not visible here.
