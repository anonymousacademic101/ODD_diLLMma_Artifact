The road ahead appears to be relatively straight as it extends from the foreground into the distance. While there may be a slight bend in the road beyond the traffic light, from the perspective provided in the image, there is no sharp curve visible. The road layout, traffic signals, and positioning of vehicles suggest a typical urban street intersection rather than a sharp curve.
