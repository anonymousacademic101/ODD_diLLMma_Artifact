The road ahead is beginning to curve to the left, and although it is not possible to determine the full sharpness of the curve from this single image, indications such as the visible trajectory and the road markings suggest that it might be a sharper curve. It's advisable to approach such a curve with caution, reducing speed appropriately and being prepared for the road to bend more than what is initially visible.
