NO

The road depicted in the image does not appear to be a sharp curve; rather, it looks like a normal intersection with vehicles positioned to make various turns. The car in front is oriented at a slight angle, which might suggest it's completing a turn, but the overall road layout visible does not suggest a sharp curve is present.
