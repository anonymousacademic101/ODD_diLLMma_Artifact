NO.

From the perspective given in the image, the road ahead does not appear to be on a sharp curve. Instead, the road seems to go straight forward with only a slight curve to the right at the distant end, which does not qualify as a sharp curve. A sharp curve is typically indicated by road signs and a dramatic change in the road's direction, which is not evident here.
