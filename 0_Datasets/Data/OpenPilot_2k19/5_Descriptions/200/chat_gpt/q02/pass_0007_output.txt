The road shown in the image appears to be relatively straight based on the direction of the lane markings and the headlights of other vehicles in the distance. Sharp curves would generally cause the lane markings to curve visibly and the headlights of other cars would be moving in a more pronounced curve. However, due to the angle and quality of the image, the exact curvature of the road in the distance can't be determined with absolute certainty.
