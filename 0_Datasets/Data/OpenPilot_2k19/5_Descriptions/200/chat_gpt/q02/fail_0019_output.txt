NO.

The road ahead does not appear to be a sharp curve. Instead, it looks like there are multiple lanes at an intersection with road markings that suggest turns and straight paths. The curve that can be perceived is likely part of a turn lane or a gentle bend as part of the intersection design, not a sharp curve in the road. The bright road markings and the context of the traffic signals and signs suggest that this is an intersection rather than a sharp bend in the road.
