The image you provided shows a vehicle lineup at a fast-food restaurant's drive-through lane. The "road" is not a public thoroughfare but a designed pathway for cars to follow through the drive-through service area. It appears to be curving gently towards the service window as is typical of such lanes, but it is not a sharp curve in the context of roadways or driving conditions.
