NO.

The image shows a road with multiple lanes of traffic at what appears to be either dusk or dawn, as indicated by the illuminated car headlights and streetlights. The road seems to be relatively straight where the photo was taken, with no immediate evidence of a sharp curve in the visible stretch of the road. The traffic is heavy, which often correlates with straighter sections of road in urban environments where highways and major streets typically accommodate higher volumes of vehicles. Sharp curves are less common in such areas due to the need for steady traffic flow. However, it is possible that a curve exists beyond the field of view of the image, but based on the available visual information, the immediate road is not on a sharp curve.
