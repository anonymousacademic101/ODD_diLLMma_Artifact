NO.

The curve in the road ahead does not appear to be a sharp one. Although the road is turning, the bend is gentle and can be navigated without a significant reduction in speed under normal driving conditions. The angle of the curve is visible, and it seems to be a slight turn to the right rather than a sharp curve.
