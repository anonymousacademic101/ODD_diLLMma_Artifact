The road ahead appears to be veering slightly to the right but it does not constitute a sharp curve. The visible lines and the positioning of the road signs suggest a gentle curve or a slight bend rather than a sharp turn. Sharp curves are typically accompanied by warning signs specifically indicating the severity of the curve, which are not visible in this image.
