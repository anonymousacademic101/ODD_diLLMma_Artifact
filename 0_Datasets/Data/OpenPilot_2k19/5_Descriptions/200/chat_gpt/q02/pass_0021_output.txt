NO.

The image does not depict a road with a sharp curve. Instead, it appears to be a drive-thru lane of a quick-service restaurant. The picture shows a vehicle waiting in line behind another car, with a view of the restaurant's pick-up window. The enclosure of the drive-thru lane may curve slightly to guide cars through the service path, but this does not constitute a sharp curve typical of a road or highway.
