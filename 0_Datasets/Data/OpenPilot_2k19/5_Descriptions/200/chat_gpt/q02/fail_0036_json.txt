There is a slight bend to the left indicated by the road markings, but it is not sharp. A sharp curve would generally show a more pronounced change in direction within a shorter distance, and the lane markings would typically indicate a tighter turn. Here, the road markings suggest a slight curve or a merge, rather than a sharp turn.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
