The road ahead does appear to bend slightly to the right, but it does not constitute a sharp curve. It seems to be a gentle curve as indicated by the trajectory of the vehicles and the visible lane markings. Sharp curves are typically indicated by more drastic changes in the direction of the road and often have additional warning signs or signals, none of which are apparent in this image.
