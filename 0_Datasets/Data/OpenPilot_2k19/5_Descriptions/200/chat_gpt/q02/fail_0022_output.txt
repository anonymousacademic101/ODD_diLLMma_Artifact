NO

The road ahead does not appear to have a sharp curve but instead leads to an intersection where the driver can choose to continue straight or turn left or right. There are no signs indicating a sharp curve and the visible lane markings and paths suggest regular intersection traffic patterns rather than a sharp bend in the road.
