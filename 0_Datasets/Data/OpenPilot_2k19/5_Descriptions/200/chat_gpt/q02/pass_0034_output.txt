NO

The road does not appear to be on a sharp curve in the image provided. The visible lane markings and the direction of the vehicles suggest that the road is fairly straight where the photo was taken, with a gentle bend perhaps starting to form in the distance. However, without additional context around the corner, it's hard to define it as a sharp curve based on this image alone.
