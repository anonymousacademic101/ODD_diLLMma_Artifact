NO.

The road in the image appears to be gently curving rather than featuring a sharp curve. The vehicles on the road are aligned in a manner suggesting a slight turn in the road ahead, but not a sharp one. A sharp curve typically requires significant steering adjustment and often has warning signs to alert drivers. None of these indications are present in the image.
