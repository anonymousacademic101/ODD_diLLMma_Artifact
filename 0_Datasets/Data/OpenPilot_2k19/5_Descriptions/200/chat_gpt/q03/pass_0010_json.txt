On-off ramps typically have a single lane and are designed for vehicles to accelerate to join the highway (on-ramps) or decelerate when leaving it (off-ramps); they usually do not have multiple lanes unless they are part of a larger interchange or turnoff. Additionally, the road appears to traverse a longer distance without any immediate signs of an exit or entrance, which is more characteristic of a highway rather than an on-off ramp.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
