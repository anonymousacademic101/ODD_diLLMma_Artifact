NO.

The road in the image is a multi-lane freeway or highway, not an on-off ramp. The visible road markings, such as the dashed lines between lanes, indicate multiple lanes for through traffic rather than the single lane typically associated with ramps. Additionally, there is no signage indicating that it is an on-ramp or off-ramp, and the volume of traffic across several lanes suggests it is a main thoroughfare.
