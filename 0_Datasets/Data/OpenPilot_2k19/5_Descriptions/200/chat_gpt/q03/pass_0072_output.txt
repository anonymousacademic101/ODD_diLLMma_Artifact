The image shows a road with a sign indicating an exit, which is typically found on an off-ramp from a highway or freeway. Also, the lane we are in has dashed lines on the left side and a solid line on the right, which suggests it is a lane designated for exiting the main flow of traffic. Additionally, the road is curving to the right towards the exit, and there is another road parallel to it on the left, indicating a split from the main road, characteristic of an off-ramp.
