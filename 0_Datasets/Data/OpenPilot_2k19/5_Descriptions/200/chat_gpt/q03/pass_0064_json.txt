On-off ramps typically have a deceleration lane followed by a sharp curve to facilitate vehicles entering or exiting a motorway, which does not seem to be present in the image shown. However, the image quality and details are limited, making it difficult to make a definitive assessment."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
