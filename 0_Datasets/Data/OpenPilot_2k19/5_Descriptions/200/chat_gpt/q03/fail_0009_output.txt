The image shows a queue of cars that appears to be at a drive-thru lane of a restaurant or similar establishment, not an on-off ramp of a highway or freeway. On-off ramps typically have different designs and signage, and they do not feature the kind of infrastructure seen here, such as a building window, a drive-thru canopy, or a line of cars waiting for service at a window.
