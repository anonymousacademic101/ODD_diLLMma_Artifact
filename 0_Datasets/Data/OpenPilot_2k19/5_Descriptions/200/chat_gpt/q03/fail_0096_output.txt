The visual indicators in the image suggest that the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp. The lane markings, including a wide gore (or separation) area on the right with chevrons, are characteristic of an exit or entrance ramp for a highway or freeway. Additionally, the green overhead signs typically indicate the direction and lane use for highway ramps, further confirming that this is indeed an on-off ramp.
