The image shows a road with traffic lights and crosswalk markings. An on-off ramp typically connects highways or freeways with local roads and doesn't have traffic lights regulating the flow of traffic right on the ramp. The presence of traffic lights and pedestrian crossing lines suggests this is more likely an intersection of local roads rather than an on-off ramp.
