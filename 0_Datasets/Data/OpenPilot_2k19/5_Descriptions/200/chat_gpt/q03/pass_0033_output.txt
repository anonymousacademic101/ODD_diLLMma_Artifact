NO.

The road we are seeing in the image looks to be a main multi-lane freeway or highway and not an on-off ramp. On-off ramps typically have a single lane or at most two lanes and are used to enter or exit a freeway. The road in the photo has multiple lanes and the flow of traffic is straight without the characteristic curving or merging pattern of on-off ramps. Additionally, the overhead sign indicates distances to upcoming exits, which is a feature typically seen on the main stretch of a highway.
