The road appears to be an on-off ramp due to the presence of a warning road sign that features a curved arrow, which is often used to indicate a sharp bend in the road, typical for on-off ramps connecting highways to local roads. The presence of this sign, along with what seems to be a barrier to the side, and the curvature of the road seen in the headlights, suggests that this is an on-off ramp.
