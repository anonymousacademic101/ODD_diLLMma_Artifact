On-off ramps typically are one-way and donâ€™t have a double yellow line since they serve as connectors between different roadways, such as a highway and a local road. Furthermore, the visible road sign does not have the usual characteristics of signs indicating an exit or entrance ramp, which further suggests that this is not an on-off ramp.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
