NO

The road in the image does not appear to be an on-off ramp. On-off ramps typically have a more pronounced curve and are used to transition between different road levels, such as from a highway to a local road. This road does not exhibit the characteristics of an on-off ramp; it looks more like a standard, straight section of a multi-lane road, possibly a highway.
