NO.

The road in the image has characteristics of a regular highway or a main road rather than an on-off ramp. It has multiple lanes and a divider, with traffic flowing in one direction, similar to a typical highway section. On-off ramps typically have a single lane or possibly two and are designed to connect highways with local roads or with other highways, often curving more distinctly to meet a perpendicular road. The road in the image seems to be continuing straight ahead rather than leading towards an exit or an entrance, which is more indicative of a standard highway stretch.
