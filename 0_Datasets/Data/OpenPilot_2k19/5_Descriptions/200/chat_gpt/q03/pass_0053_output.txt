NO.

The image shows a multilane roadway with vehicles traveling in parallel lanes, which is characteristic of a highway or a freeway, not an on-off ramp. On-off ramps typically have one or two lanes and are used for entering or exiting a highway, and they often have more pronounced curves or inclines as they connect the highway to local roads. The road in the image seems to be relatively straight, and the presence of multiple lanes suggests it is part of a main thoroughfare rather than an access ramp.
