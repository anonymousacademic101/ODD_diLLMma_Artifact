NO.

The road in the image does not appear to be an on-off ramp but rather a section of a multi-lane freeway or highway. On-off ramps typically have more pronounced curvature or diverging lanes leading to or from the main roadway. Here, we see several lanes with traffic traveling in the same direction, which is consistent with a main highway or freeway rather than an on-off ramp. Additionally, there's no visible signage or road design that would indicate the road is an on or off-ramp.
