On-off ramps typically have a more pronounced curvature or tapering lane structure, which is designed to allow vehicles to decelerate from highway speeds or accelerate to highway speeds when entering the highway from a ramp. The road in the image shows multiple lanes continuing forward with no immediate indication of a merging or diverging pattern that would suggest it's an on-off ramp. The overhead sign also displays multiple street or exit names, which is common on the main lanes of a highway to direct drivers to upcoming exits."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
