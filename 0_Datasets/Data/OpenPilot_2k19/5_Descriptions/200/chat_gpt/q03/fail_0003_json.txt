On-off ramps typically consist of merging lanes that facilitate the transition between highways and local roads, and are generally characterized by continuous curves or gentle slopes to manage the speed of merging vehicles. Additionally, on-off ramps do not typically have perpendicular intersections or the kind of entrance to a property or secondary road as shown in this image. The presence of parking lots and building fronts suggests this is more likely an access road or a road within a commercial area.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
