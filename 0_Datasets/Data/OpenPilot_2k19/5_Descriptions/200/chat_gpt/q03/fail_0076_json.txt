Instead, it appears to be a local road. There are multiple lanes, traffic signals, and road signage that indicate local traffic management rather than the characteristics of a highway on-off ramp, which usually involves merging lanes and yield or acceleration signs to facilitate the transition between highway speeds and local road speeds. Additionally, the presence of residential buildings and parked cars suggest this is an urban or suburban area with standard roadways, rather than a highway interchange.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
