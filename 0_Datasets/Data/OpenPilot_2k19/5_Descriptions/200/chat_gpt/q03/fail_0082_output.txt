YES

The signage and road markings suggest you are on a road that is leading to an on-ramp. Specifically, there is a sign indicating a right turn for an on-ramp to a highway, demonstrated by the green sign with a white arrow and highway number. The dashed white lines on the road are typical for lane division where merging maneuvers are expected, as seen at the entrance of an on-ramp. Additionally, there is a dedicated lane that appears to be diverging from the main road, which is typical for an on-ramp entrance.
