The roadway shown in the image appears to be a main travel lane of a highway or freeway, not an on-off ramp. On-off ramps are typically auxiliary lanes that branch off from or merge onto the main highway lanes to allow vehicles to enter or exit the highway. The road in the image has multiple lanes, with a barrier on the left side and an exit sign overhead, indicating that it is part of the main highway. The on-off ramp would be to the right of the shown lanes and not depicted in this view.
