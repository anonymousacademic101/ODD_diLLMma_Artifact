YES.

The reasons are as follows:

1. The curvature and tapering nature of the lane suggest it is designed for decelerating vehicles exiting a highway or accelerating vehicles entering a highway.
2. There is a line of vehicles which indicates the possibility of cars waiting to either merge onto or exit from a busy road, typical for ramps during peak hours.
3. The presence of signage and street lights is common near on-off ramps for guiding drivers during transitional points between highways and local roads.
