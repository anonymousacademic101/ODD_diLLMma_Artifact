The road in the image appears to be a multi-lane freeway or expressway, as indicated by the lane markings, multiple lanes, and overhead signage directing to different city destinations. An on-off ramp typically is a single-lane road leading to or from such a freeway, and it wouldn't have multiple lanes or directional signage for cities as seen here.
