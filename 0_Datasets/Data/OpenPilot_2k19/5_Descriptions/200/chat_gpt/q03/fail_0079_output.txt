NO

The road does not appear to be an on-off ramp. It seems to be a parking lot or a driveway leading into a commercial area with parked cars and storefronts visible. The layout and the presence of parking spaces are not characteristic of an on-off ramp, which typically connects highways with other roads and does not have parking spots directly adjacent to it.
