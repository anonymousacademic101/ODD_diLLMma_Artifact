NO.

This does not appear to be an on-off ramp. The scene shows multiple lanes with traffic moving at speed, which is characteristic of a highway or freeway. On-off ramps typically have a single lane and are designed to allow vehicles to enter or exit highways, often curving or merging rather than proceeding straight as the road in this image does. Additionally, there is no signage visible that indicates an exit or entrance to the highway, which is common for on-off ramps.
