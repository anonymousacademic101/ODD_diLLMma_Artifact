NO.

This does not appear to be an on-off ramp. It seems to be a highway or a multi-lane road as evidenced by the presence of multiple lanes in both directions and the absence of typical on-ramp or off-ramp features like merging traffic lines or exit signs. The road is relatively straight and traffic is flowing smoothly in parallel lanes, which is characteristic of a main thoroughfare rather than an on-off ramp.
