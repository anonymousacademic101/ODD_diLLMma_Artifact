This does not appear to be an on-off ramp. It looks like a highway or a freeway with multiple lanes and an overhead sign indicating directions and exits for different destinations, which is typical for mainline roads rather than on-off ramps. On-off ramps typically have fewer lanes and are used for entering or exiting a main road rather than through travel.
