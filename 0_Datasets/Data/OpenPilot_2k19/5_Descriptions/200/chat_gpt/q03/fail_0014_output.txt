NO.

The image seems to show a vehicle that is approaching or at an intersection, not on an on-off ramp. There is a vehicle parked to the left side of the area in question, and there is a yellow diamond-shaped sign, which typically indicates a warning or caution ahead on streets or highways, but not specifically an on-off ramp. Additionally, there is a median with vegetation, which is more commonly found at intersections rather than highway ramps. Furthermore, the overall setting does not resemble the typical design of on-off ramps, which generally have clear lane markings for entering or exiting a highway.
