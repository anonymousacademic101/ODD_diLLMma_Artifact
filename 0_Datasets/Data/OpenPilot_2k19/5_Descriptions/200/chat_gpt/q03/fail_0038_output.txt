This does not appear to be an on-off ramp. On-off ramps are typically associated with highways or freeways and are designed to allow vehicles to enter and exit at higher speeds, typically featuring merge areas and often no direct access to properties. The road in the image has residential driveways, parked cars, and appears to be a local street within a community, which would not be the case with an on-off ramp.
