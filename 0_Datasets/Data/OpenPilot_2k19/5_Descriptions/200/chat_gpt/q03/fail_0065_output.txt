NO.

The road in the image does not appear to be an on-off ramp. It looks like a driveway or an access road within a parking area of a commercial building. There are parking spaces visible in the background, and the arrow markings on the ground suggest traffic directions for parking lots rather than for highway ramps. Additionally, there is a curb and a red no-parking zone typical of parking lots adjacent to buildings.
