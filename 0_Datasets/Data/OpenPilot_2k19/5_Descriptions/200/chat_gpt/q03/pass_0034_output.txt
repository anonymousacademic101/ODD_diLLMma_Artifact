NO.

The road in the image appears to be a multi-lane highway, not an on-off ramp. On-off ramps typically have a single lane and are used for entering or exiting highways, whereas the road shown has multiple lanes and traffic is flowing in the same direction, without signs of an upcoming exit or entrance.
