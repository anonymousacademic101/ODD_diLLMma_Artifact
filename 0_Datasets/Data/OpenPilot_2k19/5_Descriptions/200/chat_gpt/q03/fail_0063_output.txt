The image shows a parking lot with parked cars and a building with a prominent "Target" store sign in the background, which is not characteristic of an on-off ramp. On-off ramps typically don't have parked cars directly adjacent to the driving lane and are generally designed to serve as access points to and from highways, not as parking areas for retail stores.
