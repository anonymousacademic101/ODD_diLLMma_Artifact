Based on the image provided, it appears that the road is not an on-off ramp but rather a typical intersection in an urban or suburban area with a traffic light and cross streets, as indicated by the street name sign "Arch St" and the surrounding environment. On-off ramps typically have signs related to freeways or expressways and do not usually have traffic lights or cross streets at their termini.
