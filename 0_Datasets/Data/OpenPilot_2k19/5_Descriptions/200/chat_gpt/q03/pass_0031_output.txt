The presence of solid lines typically implies that this is a lane where merging onto or off of a highway is controlled and thus indicates an on-off ramp. Additionally, the angle at which the vehicles are entering or leaving the main flow of traffic is characteristic of an on-off ramp rather than a typical highway lane.
