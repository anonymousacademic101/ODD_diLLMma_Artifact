NO.

The road in the image does not appear to be an on-off ramp. It looks to be a regular city street with crosswalks, traffic signals, and a vehicle waiting at a green light. On-off ramps usually do not have these features and are designed to facilitate vehicles entering or exiting highways or freeways, often without traffic lights and with different signage and lane markings.
