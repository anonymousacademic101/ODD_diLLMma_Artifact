NO.

The road does not appear to be an on-off ramp. It seems to be a regular intersection with traffic lights, as opposed to the limited access and merging characteristics typical of highway on-off ramps. There is a visible red traffic light and crossing traffic, which indicates it is more likely a standard road junction.
