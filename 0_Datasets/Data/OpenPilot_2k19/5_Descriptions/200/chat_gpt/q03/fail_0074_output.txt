NO.

This road does not appear to be an on-off ramp. On-off ramps are typically associated with highways or freeways and are used to enter or exit these roads. The image shows a traffic signal and a crosswalk, which are more commonly found on urban or suburban roads rather than on-off ramps. The environment also looks residential, and there are parking lots visible, indicating that this is a more standard road within a city or town rather than a ramp for a highway.
