YES.

The image depicts a road with characteristics commonly associated with an on-off ramp. We can see that this road is curving to the right and there is an evident acceleration or deceleration lane. On-off ramps are typically designed to allow vehicles to enter or exit expressways, highways, or freeways, characterized by their curved paths and merging lanes. The setting, with no visible traffic signals or intersections, suggests that this is not a standard urban street or rural road. Also, the wide lanes are indicative of a design meant to accommodate vehicles at higher speeds, suggesting a connection with a faster roadway.
