NO.

The image provided appears to show a car waiting at an intersection with traffic lights. An on-off ramp typically refers to the access roads that connect highways to local roads or other highways and do not feature traffic lights as intersections do. The painted arrows on the road and the presence of traffic signaling devices suggest that this is an intersection on a local road, rather than an on-off ramp, which would not have traffic control signals for crossing traffic.
