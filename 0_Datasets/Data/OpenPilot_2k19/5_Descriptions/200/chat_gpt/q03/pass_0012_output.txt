NO.

This does not appear to be an on-off ramp but rather a highway or a multi-lane road. On-off ramps typically have a more pronounced curve and are used to enter or exit highways, and they usually have one lane or perhaps two in some cases, but this road seems to be a straight section of a multi-lane road with several vehicles traveling in parallel, which is indicative of a main travel lane on a highway, not an on-off ramp.
