The image shows a multi-lane highway at night with traffic moving in the same direction, indicated by the red tail lights of the vehicles ahead. On-off ramps typically are not multi-lane highways and are designed for vehicles to enter or exit a main highway. The traffic patterns and road design in the image suggest it is part of a main highway rather than an on-off ramp.
