YES.

The curved road trajectory, the tapering of the lane, and the arrows painted on the pavement all suggest that this is an on-ramp or off-ramp, indicating a point where traffic merges with or departs from a highway or major road. Additionally, the presence of a traffic light ahead implies an intersection or juncture where an on-off ramp would typically terminate or originate.
