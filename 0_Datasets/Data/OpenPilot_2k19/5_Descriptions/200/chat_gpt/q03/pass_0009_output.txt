NO.

The road in the image appears to be a multi-lane highway or freeway rather than an on-off ramp. On-off ramps typically have a single lane and are used for entering or exiting highways, whereas the road in the image has multiple lanes and is designed for higher-speed travel, indicative of a main thoroughfare rather than a ramp. Additionally, the presence of a road sign indicating an exit ahead suggests that this is the main part of the highway, and an off-ramp may be upcoming.
