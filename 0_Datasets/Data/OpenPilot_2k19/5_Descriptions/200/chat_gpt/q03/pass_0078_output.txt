The road in the image appears to be a main highway or freeway lane rather than an on-off ramp. This is indicated by the multiple lanes of traffic and the absence of any signage or roadway design that specifically indicates a transition to or from the main travel lanes, such as tapering or deceleration/acceleration lanes commonly found at the beginning or end of on-off ramps.
