The road we are driving on appears to be an on-off ramp due to the presence of a dedicated lane separating from the main roadway, indicated by a solid white line, which is a typical characteristic of such ramps. Additionally, there is a traffic signal specifically for this lane, further suggesting that it is designed for vehicles to enter or exit a highway or a major road.
