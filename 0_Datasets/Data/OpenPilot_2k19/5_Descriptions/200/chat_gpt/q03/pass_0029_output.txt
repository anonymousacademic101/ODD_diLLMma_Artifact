NO.

The image appears to show a multi-lane highway or freeway at night, judging by the multiple vehicles in adjacent lanes traveling at speed, the dashed lane markings, and the overhead sign in the distance. On- and off-ramps typically consist of single or fewer lanes and are used to enter or exit such highways, connecting them with other roads or local streets. The scene in the photograph suggests that it is a main travelway rather than an access ramp.
