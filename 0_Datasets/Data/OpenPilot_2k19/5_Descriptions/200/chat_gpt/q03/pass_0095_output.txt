NO.

The image shows a typical intersection with traffic lights and pedestrian crosswalks, which suggests it is a regular city street or urban road, not an on-off ramp which typically connects highways to local roads and wouldn't have the sort of pedestrian crossing signals that are visible in the image. On-off ramps usually don't have intersections with traffic signals as seen in this image.
