NO.

This scene appears to depict a typical intersection with traffic lights, crosswalks, and multiple lanes for straight and turning traffic. On-off ramps generally connect highways to local roads and do not have crosswalks and traffic lights as shown in the image. They usually feature merge lanes and yield or stop signs where necessary. This scene lacks the characteristics of an on-off ramp and instead indicates a standard urban or suburban road intersection.
