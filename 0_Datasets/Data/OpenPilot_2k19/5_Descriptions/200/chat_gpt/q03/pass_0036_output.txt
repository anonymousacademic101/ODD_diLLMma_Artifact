The image shows a two-lane road with what appears to be a dashed yellow line down the center, indicating a two-way traffic flow. On-off ramps typically are one-way and donâ€™t have a double yellow line since they serve as connectors between different roadways, such as a highway and a local road. Furthermore, the visible road sign does not have the usual characteristics of signs indicating an exit or entrance ramp, which further suggests that this is not an on-off ramp.
