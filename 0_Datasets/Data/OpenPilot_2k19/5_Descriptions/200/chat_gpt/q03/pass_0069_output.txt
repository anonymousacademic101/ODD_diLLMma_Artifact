NO.

Based on the image provided, the road looks like a multi-lane highway or freeway, not an on-off ramp. There are multiple lanes of traffic and no indication of the roadway being an entrance or exit ramp, such as tapering of lanes or signage specifically for entering or exiting the highway. The overhead signs also indicate lanes for through traffic and distances to upcoming exits, which is typical of a main travel lane on a highway.
