NO.

The image shows what appears to be a regular intersection with traffic signals. On-off ramps typically connect highways to local roads or other highways and do not have traffic signals at the point of merging or diverging; instead, they use yield or merge signs, acceleration and deceleration lanes for these maneuvers. Here, we see a traffic light and a crosswalk, which are common features of intersections within city roads, not features one would expect on an on-off ramp.
