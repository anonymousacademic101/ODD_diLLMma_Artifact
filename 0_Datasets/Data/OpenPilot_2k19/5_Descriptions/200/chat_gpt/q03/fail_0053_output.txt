NO.

This does not appear to be an on-off ramp. The road we see here is a pedestrian crossing leading up to the entrance of a retail establishment, indicated by the crosswalk markings and the proximity to the store entrances for Target and CVS Pharmacy. On-off ramps typically connect highways to local roads and do not lead directly into commercial property or have pedestrian crossings.
