The road pictured appears to be an on-off ramp based on several visible characteristics: the curvature of the road, the fact that it seems to connect with a larger roadway, and the presence of what appears to be an acceleration or deceleration lane. On-off ramps typically have these features to facilitate the smooth transition of vehicles onto or off of highways.
