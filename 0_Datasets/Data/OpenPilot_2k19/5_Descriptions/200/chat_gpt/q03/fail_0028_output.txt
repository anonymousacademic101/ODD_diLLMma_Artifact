YES.

The road featured in the image seems to be an on-off ramp, as indicated by the road sign showing a symbol of an interchange (often used to indicate an exit or entrance to a highway) and an arrow suggesting a curve or exit ahead. Additionally, the road appears to curve to the right, consistent with the design of many on-off ramps that connect local roads with highways.
