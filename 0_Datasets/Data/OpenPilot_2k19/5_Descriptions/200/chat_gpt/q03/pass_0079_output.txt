The road in the image appears to be an on-off ramp based on the following observations: There is a noticeable curvature to the road, which is typical for ramps connecting freeways with local roads; the line markings on the road indicate a division or exit from the main lanes; and there is an overhead road sign which often signifies an exit or entrance to a freeway, all of which are characteristic of on-off ramps.
