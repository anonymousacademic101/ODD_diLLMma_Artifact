We can see what appears to be a gas station to the right and possibly a stop light ahead, indicating that this is likely a city street or local road. On-off ramps typically do not have direct access to gas stations and are designed to facilitate traffic merging onto or off of highways, which does not seem to be the case here. The road we are looking at appears to be entering or exiting a more populated area rather than a highway.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
