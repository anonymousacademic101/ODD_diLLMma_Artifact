There are several indications of this: the presence of a traffic signal, a pedestrian crossing, and the urban environment with buildings and parked cars on the side of the street, which are characteristic of city streets rather than on-off ramps associated with highways or freeways. Additionally, on-off ramps typically do not have pedestrian crossings or traffic signals as these are designed for merging or exiting at higher speeds without interruptions.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
