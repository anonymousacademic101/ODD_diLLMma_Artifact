The green signage overhead indicates exits for Lakeville Drive, South McDowell Boulevard, Sonoma/Marin Fairgrounds, and Downtown Petaluma, suggesting that it is pointing to off-ramps from the current road. The road itself doesn't seem to taper off or merge, which are characteristics of an on-ramp or off-ramp. However, the vehicle is not directly on an on-off ramp but is on the main travel lanes approaching potential off-ramps."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
