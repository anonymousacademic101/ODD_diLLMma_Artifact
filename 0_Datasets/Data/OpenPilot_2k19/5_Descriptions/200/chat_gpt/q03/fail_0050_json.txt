The image shows a vehicle and headlight glare from oncoming traffic, which makes it difficult to determine the specific type of road. However, there doesn't appear to be the signage or layout typically associated with on-off ramps, such as clear directional arrows or signs indicating an exit or entry to a highway. Instead, the road seems to be in a more urban or commercial area with surrounding parking and buildings, which could suggest it's a regular street or access road rather than a highway on-off ramp."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
