The road in the image shows multiple lanes of traffic with vehicles waiting at a traffic light, which indicates it is a regular intersection rather than an on-off ramp (which typically does not have traffic signals and is designed for merging onto or off of a highway). The presence of road markings for straight-ahead traffic and a gas station on the corner further support that this is not an on-off ramp. On-off ramps usually have distinct merging lanes and do not feature direct access to local businesses right at the intersections with the highways.
