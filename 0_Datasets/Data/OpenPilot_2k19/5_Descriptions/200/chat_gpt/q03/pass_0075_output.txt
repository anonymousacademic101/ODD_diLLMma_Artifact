NO.

We are not driving on an on-off ramp. The image shows a multi-lane highway with separate lanes for traffic going in opposite directions, as indicated by the median and the presence of a vehicle in the distance on the left side traveling in the opposite direction. On-off ramps are typically shorter lanes that branch off from highways to allow vehicles to enter or exit, featuring curvature or tapering and having entry or exit traffic control signs, which are not visible in this image. Moreover, the road infrastructure visible suggests a section of a main thoroughfare rather than an access ramp.
