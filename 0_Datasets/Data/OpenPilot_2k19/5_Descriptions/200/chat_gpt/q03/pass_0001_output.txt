The image seems to show a vehicle stopped at an intersection with traffic signals and a pedestrian crossing, which indicates a regular road rather than a highway on-off ramp. On-off ramps typically don't have such features as pedestrian crossings and traffic lights; they are designed to allow vehicles to enter or exit highways smoothly without such intersections.
