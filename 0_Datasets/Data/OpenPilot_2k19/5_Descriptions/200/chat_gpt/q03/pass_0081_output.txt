NO

The road we are looking at does not appear to be an on-off ramp. On-off ramps typically facilitate the movement of vehicles from surface streets to freeways or from freeways to surface streets and often have features such as yield or merge signs, acceleration or deceleration lanes, and usually lack traffic signals directly on them. In this image, we see traffic signals regulating the flow of vehicles, which is characteristic of intersections on surface streets rather than on-off ramps.
