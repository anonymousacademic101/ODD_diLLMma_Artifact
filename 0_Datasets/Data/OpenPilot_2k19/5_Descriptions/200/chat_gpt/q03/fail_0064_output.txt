NO

The location depicted in the image is a parking lot, not an on-off ramp. This can be determined by the presence of parked cars in lined parking spaces, a typically static and stationary environment, as opposed to the transient nature of an on-off ramp where vehicles are usually in motion, either accelerating to merge onto a highway or decelerating to exit it.
