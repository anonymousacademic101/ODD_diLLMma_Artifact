On-off ramps usually have signage or are structured in a way that indicates a connection to a major roadway, which is not visible in this image. Instead, the road appears to be a regular junction or merging lane of a smaller road or street."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
