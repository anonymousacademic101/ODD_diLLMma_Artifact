An on-off ramp usually consists of a single lane diverging from or merging onto a highway and typically wouldn't have multiple lanes with dashed lane markers like the road in this image. Additionally, there appears to be traffic in parallel lanes at a distance, suggesting this is a section of a larger highway or main road rather than an on-off ramp which would not have parallel flowing traffic."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
