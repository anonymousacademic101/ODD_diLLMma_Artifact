Based on the image, the road appears to be a curving road rather than a typical on-off ramp. On-off ramps usually have a more pronounced design to facilitate vehicles accelerating to join highways or decelerating to leave highways, and they typically don't have intersections or access to side roads, as suggested by the presence of the white car waiting at the side. However, without additional context or signage, it is not possible to definitively determine the road's purpose, but the visual cues suggest it's not a standard highway interchange ramp.
