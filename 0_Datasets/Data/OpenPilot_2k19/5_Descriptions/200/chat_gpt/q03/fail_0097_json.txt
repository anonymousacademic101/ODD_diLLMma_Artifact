On-off ramps typically have a curved approach to facilitate the merging of traffic onto or off a highway. The road in the image does not exhibit the characteristics of a typical on-off ramp, such as signs for entering or exiting a highway, highway traffic, or a distinctive curve for acceleration or deceleration. Instead, we see a straight road with an area that looks more suitable for a local road junction or intersection.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
