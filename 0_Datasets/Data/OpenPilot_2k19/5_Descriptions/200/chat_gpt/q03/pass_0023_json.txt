On-off ramps typically have a single lane and are designed to allow vehicles to enter or exit freeways; they are not as wide as the road in the image and usually feature sharper curves or inclines to facilitate the transition between road types. The road depicted has several lanes of traffic traveling in the same direction and does not display any immediate signage or structure indicative of an on-off ramp.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
