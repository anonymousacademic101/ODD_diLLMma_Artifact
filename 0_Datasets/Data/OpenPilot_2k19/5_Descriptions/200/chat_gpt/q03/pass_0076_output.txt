NO

The road in the image does not appear to be an on-off ramp. It seems to be a typical city street or arterial road with multiple lanes of traffic, traffic signals, and a variety of vehicles stopped as if waiting at a traffic light, which is not characteristic of on-off ramps that typically have less complex intersections and are designed primarily for entering or exiting highways.
