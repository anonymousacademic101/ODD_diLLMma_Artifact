NO.

The road we're driving on does not appear to be an on-off ramp. This seems to be a main road or highway with multiple lanes and no apparent exit or entrance curvature that you would expect from an on-off ramp. Additionally, the vehicles are spaced and positioned as they would typically be in a lane of traffic on a regular road, not merging or exiting as one would see on an on-ramp or off-ramp.
