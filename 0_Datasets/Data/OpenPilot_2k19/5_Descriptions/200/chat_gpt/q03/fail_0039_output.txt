NO.

Based on the visible road markings and layout shown in the image, this road appears to be a regular roadway rather than an on-off ramp. On-off ramps typically have specific design features, such as a deceleration or acceleration lane and distinct entry or exit points for transitioning between a highway and a local road, none of which are clearly visible in this image. This road seems to be traveling through a natural area with trees on either side, which could suggest it's a rural road or a parkway rather than a highway interchange.
