NO.

The image shows a road at night with limited visibility, so it is difficult to definitively identify the type of road based solely on this image. There are no clear signs or markers that indicate an on-ramp or off-ramp specifically. The curve in the road and the lane lines suggest it may be a regular road or a highway, but without additional context or signage, it cannot be confirmed as an on-off ramp.
