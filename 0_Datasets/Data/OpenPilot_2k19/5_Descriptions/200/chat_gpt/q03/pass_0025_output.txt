The road in the image appears to be a regular highway or expressway rather than an on-off ramp. There are multiple lanes, and the road continues straight ahead without the curvature typically associated with ramps that lead on or off major roads. Furthermore, there are no visible signs or indicators typically found at the beginning or end of an on-off ramp, such as exit or entrance signs.
