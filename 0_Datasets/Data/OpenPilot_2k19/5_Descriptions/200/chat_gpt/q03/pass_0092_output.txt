NO

The road in the image does not appear to be an on-off ramp. It looks like a regular city street or road with multiple lanes given the traffic lights and lane markings visible, buildings adjacent to the roadway, and a general urban setting. On-off ramps typically connect highways to local roads and do not have traffic signals like the ones we see in the image.
