There is no clear indication of it being an entry or exit to a highway, such as acceleration or deceleration lanes, merge signs, or other typical features associated with on-off ramps. The presence of a crosswalk, a traffic light ahead, and buildings directly adjacent to the road suggest it's more likely a regular city street. Additionally, the overhead street name sign is not consistent with highway ramp signage."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
