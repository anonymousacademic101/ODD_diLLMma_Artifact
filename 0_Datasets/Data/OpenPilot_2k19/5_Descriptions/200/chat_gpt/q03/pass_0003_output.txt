NO.

The road we are driving on is not an on-off ramp. It appears to be a multi-lane highway. The characteristics of this road include multiple lanes, barrier dividers, and overhead signage for highway directions, which are typical features of highways, not on-off ramps. On-off ramps usually have fewer lanes (often only one lane) and are used for entering or exiting a highway, not for through traffic.
