NO.

The road in the image appears to be a regular surface street rather than an on-off ramp. On-off ramps typically connect highways or freeways with local roads and tend to have specific design characteristics like curvature, sloping, and signage indicating the transition to or from a highway. In this image, there are multiple lanes with parked cars on the side, and the road design does not suggest it is an on-off ramp. Instead, it looks like a typical multi-lane urban or suburban street. There are also trees and a sidewalk adjacent to the road, which are common in urban settings but less so on highway ramps.
