NO.

The road in the image appears to be a surface road or a regular road with multiple lanes. It does not have the typical characteristics of an on-off ramp such as tapering lanes or signage indicating an entrance or exit to a freeway. There are also no visible indications of a nearby freeway that the ramp would serve. The road seems to be leading directly into a more typical traffic scenario with another vehicle visible in an oncoming lane, as opposed to merging or diverging patterns associated with ramps.
