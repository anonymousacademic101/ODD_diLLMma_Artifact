The photo shows a road with multiple lanes and a relatively straight path, which is more indicative of a main road or highway rather than an on-off ramp. On-off ramps typically have a more curved design to facilitate the decrease or increase in speed needed for entering or exiting a highway. Moreover, the lack of signage or lane tapering specific to ramps suggests this is not an on-off ramp.
