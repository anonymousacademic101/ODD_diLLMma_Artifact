On-off ramps typically facilitate the transition from a highway to local roads or from local roads to a highway and are usually distinct in having traffic moving in a single direction of flow onto or off the highway, rather than bidirectional flow. This road does not show the typical characteristics of an on-off ramp, such as an exit sign or deceleration/acceleration lane. Instead, it seems like a section of a highway or major road, not specifically an on-off ramp.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
