The road does not have the typical characteristics of an on-off ramp. It appears to be a surface street with multiple lanes and a traffic light controlling an intersection, rather than a ramp that would typically connect to/from a highway or freeway with merging lanes and no traffic signals for entering or exiting traffic.
