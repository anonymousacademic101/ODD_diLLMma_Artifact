NO.

The image provided appears to show a vehicle that is approaching or at an intersection, rather than driving on an on-off ramp. On-off ramps typically have a curved approach to facilitate the merging of traffic onto or off a highway. The road in the image does not exhibit the characteristics of a typical on-off ramp, such as signs for entering or exiting a highway, highway traffic, or a distinctive curve for acceleration or deceleration. Instead, we see a straight road with an area that looks more suitable for a local road junction or intersection.
