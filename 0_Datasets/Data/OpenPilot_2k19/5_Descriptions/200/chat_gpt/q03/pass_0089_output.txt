NO.

The road in the image appears to be a multi-lane highway or freeway, as indicated by the multiple lanes of traffic and the presence of a barrier on the left side separating opposite directions of travel. On-off ramps typically have a single lane and are used for entering or exiting a freeway, and they often feature merging lanes or yield signs where traffic joins or leaves the main highway. Here, the road supports a steady flow of high-speed traffic and does not show any of the tapering or diverging that would signify an on-off ramp.
