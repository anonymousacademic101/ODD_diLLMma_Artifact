NO.

The road in the image does not appear to be an on-off ramp. On-off ramps are typically connected to highways or freeways and are designed to allow vehicles to enter or exit these roads. In contrast, the road pictured seems to be a regular city street or commercial area with storefronts, parking lanes, and crosswalks, which are not characteristic of on-off ramps.
