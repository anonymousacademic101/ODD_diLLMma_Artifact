This setting does not match the typical characteristics of an on-off ramp, which is designed for vehicles to enter or exit highways or freeways. On-off ramps typically do not include pedestrian crossings and have different design features facilitating the acceleration or deceleration of vehicles. The surroundings also do not suggest a highway setting but rather a more urban or residential area.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
