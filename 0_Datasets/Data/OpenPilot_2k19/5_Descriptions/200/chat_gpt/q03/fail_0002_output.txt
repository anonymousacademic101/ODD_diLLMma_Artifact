NO.

The road depicted in the image does not appear to be an on-off ramp typically found near highways or freeways. This conclusion is based on several observations: there is a STOP painted on the road, which suggests it is a normal intersection rather than a merge lane; there are parking spots on the side of the road, indicating it is likely a city or suburban street; and the presence of buildings close to the road also suggests this is not a highway interchange area. On-off ramps typically do not have such features and are designed to facilitate the smooth flow of traffic onto or off of high-speed roadways.
