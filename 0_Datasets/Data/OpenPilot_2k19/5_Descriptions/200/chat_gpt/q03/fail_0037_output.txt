NO.

The image depicts a road with an arrow indicating a turn or merge to the right but doesn't provide enough context to conclusively determine if it's an on-off ramp of a freeway or highway. On-off ramps usually have signage or are structured in a way that indicates a connection to a major roadway, which is not visible in this image. Instead, the road appears to be a regular junction or merging lane of a smaller road or street.
