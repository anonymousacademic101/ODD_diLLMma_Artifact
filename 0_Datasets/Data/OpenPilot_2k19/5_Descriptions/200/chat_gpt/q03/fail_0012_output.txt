The image shows a road that does not have the typical features of an on-off ramp. On-off ramps usually connect highways to local roads and have a distinctive curved design to accommodate the speed change necessary when entering or exiting a highway. This road appears to be relatively straight and does not have signage or the curved approach often associated with on-off ramps. It looks more like a service road or a local road running alongside a building without signs of connecting to a highway.
