The road seems to be a regular multi-lane highway or freeway, characterized by multiple lanes and a divider on the left side that separates oncoming traffic, indicating it might be a main travel route rather than a ramp used for entering or exiting the highway. On-off ramps typically have a different design, often with a single lane curving away from or toward the highway.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
