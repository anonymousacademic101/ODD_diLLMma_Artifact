Based on the image provided, the road does not appear to be an on-off ramp because it has a traffic signal with a red light, which regulates the intersection ahead. On-off ramps typically facilitate the movement of vehicles on and off highways and do not usually have traffic signals controlling intersections right at the ramp itself; instead, they would merge into traffic flows or have stop signs at the end of the ramp if necessary.
