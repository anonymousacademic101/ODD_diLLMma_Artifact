The image you've provided does not depict an on-off ramp. An on-off ramp is usually associated with highways or freeways, and is designed to allow vehicles to transition from local roads to high-speed highways or vice versa. This image appears to show a regular intersection with multiple lanes and cross traffic, which is not characteristic of an on-off ramp. The presence of a crossroad, residential housing, and a traffic situation that involves a perpendicular approach from other vehicles indicates that this is not a highway interchange but likely a suburban or urban street intersection.
