The road does not appear to be an on-off ramp based on the context provided in the image. We can see traffic signals controlling a cross-intersection, parked vehicles along the side of the road, and multiple lanes of traffic, which are not characteristic features of a typical on-off highway ramp. Instead, this seems to be a regular urban or suburban road with signalized intersections. On-off ramps typically facilitate the movement of vehicles to and from highways and don't have traffic signals as seen in the image; they often are single-lane, merge with the highway, and have yield or stop signs for entering or exiting traffic.
