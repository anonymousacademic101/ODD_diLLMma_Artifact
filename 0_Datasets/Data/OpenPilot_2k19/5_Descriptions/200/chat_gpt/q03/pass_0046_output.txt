This appears to be an on-off ramp, often referred to as an exit ramp or entrance ramp for highways. The reasons suggesting this are the presence of a dashed white line that is typically meant to indicate a diverging point from the main lanes, as well as a merge sign visible to the right, which is commonly placed near the beginning of an entrance ramp where traffic merges onto the main highway. Additionally, the lane appears to be adding to or separating from the main carriageway, which is characteristic of an on-off ramp.
