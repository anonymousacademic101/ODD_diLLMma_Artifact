NO.

The image shows a multi-lane highway with vehicles in several lanes traveling in the same direction. On-off ramps typically are at the edges of highways and involve entering or exiting the highway, usually involving deceleration or acceleration lanes. This image does not show any features that specifically indicate an on-off ramp, such as an exit sign, diverging traffic patterns, or acceleration/deceleration lanes. Instead, it appears to be a main part of the highway.
