NO.

The road seen through the windshield appears to be a typical city street or a road within a business or industrial area. The presence of parked cars, a building directly beside the road, and a lack of highway or freeway features, such as acceleration/deceleration lanes or typical signage associated with on-off ramps, suggest it is not an on-off ramp.
