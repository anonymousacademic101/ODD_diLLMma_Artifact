YES

The road in the image appears to be an on-off ramp due to several indicators. Firstly, there is a deceleration lane to the right with vehicles queuing, suggesting it might be leading towards an off-ramp. Secondly, the overhead green sign typically indicates freeway exits or entrances. Thirdly, the road seems to be curving away to the right in a manner consistent with ramps that connect to highways or freeways. These features collectively suggest that the road being driven on is indeed an on-off ramp.
