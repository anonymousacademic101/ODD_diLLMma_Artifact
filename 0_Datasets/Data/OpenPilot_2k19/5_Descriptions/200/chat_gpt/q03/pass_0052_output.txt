NO.

The road shown in the image seems to be a multi-lane highway or freeway, as evidenced by multiple lanes of traffic and a median barrier to the left. On-off ramps are typically single-lane roads used for entering and exiting highways, and they are not directly depicted in this image. The image shows a regular travel lane on the highway with traffic moving in the same direction, not an on-off ramp.
