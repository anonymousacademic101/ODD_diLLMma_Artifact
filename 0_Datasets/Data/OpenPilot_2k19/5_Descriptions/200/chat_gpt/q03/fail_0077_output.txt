Based on this image, the road appears to be a standard city street or urban road rather than an on-off ramp. There is no clear indication of it being an entry or exit to a highway, such as acceleration or deceleration lanes, merge signs, or other typical features associated with on-off ramps. The presence of a crosswalk, a traffic light ahead, and buildings directly adjacent to the road suggest it's more likely a regular city street. Additionally, the overhead street name sign is not consistent with highway ramp signage.
