NO.

Based on the image provided, we can see a road with multiple lanes marked by dashed lines, which typically indicates a highway or a multi-lane main road. An on-off ramp usually consists of a single lane diverging from or merging onto a highway and typically wouldn't have multiple lanes with dashed lane markers like the road in this image. Additionally, there appears to be traffic in parallel lanes at a distance, suggesting this is a section of a larger highway or main road rather than an on-off ramp which would not have parallel flowing traffic.
