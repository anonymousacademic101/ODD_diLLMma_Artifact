NO

The image displayed does not show a typical on-off ramp which is usually associated with freeways and expressways. Instead, it appears to be a scene from a parking lot or a small service road beside a building labeled as a "SMOG CHECK STATION," which indicates that the vehicle is not currently on an on-off ramp designed for higher-speed traffic entering or exiting a major roadway.
