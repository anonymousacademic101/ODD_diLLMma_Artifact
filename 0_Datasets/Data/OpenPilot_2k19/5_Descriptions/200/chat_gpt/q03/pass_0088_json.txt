It has multiple lanes and a divider, with traffic flowing in one direction, similar to a typical highway section. On-off ramps typically have a single lane or possibly two and are designed to connect highways with local roads or with other highways, often curving more distinctly to meet a perpendicular road. The road in the image seems to be continuing straight ahead rather than leading towards an exit or an entrance, which is more indicative of a standard highway stretch.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
