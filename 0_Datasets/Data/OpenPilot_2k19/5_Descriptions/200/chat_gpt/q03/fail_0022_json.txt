On-off ramps are typically associated with freeways or highways and usually don't have pedestrian crossings or traffic lights right at the point where vehicles enter or exit the freeway. Instead, they are designed for vehicles to merge onto or off of the highway at speed, without stopping for traffic control devices at the ramp. Here, the setting appears to be an urban or suburban street, not a highway ramp."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
