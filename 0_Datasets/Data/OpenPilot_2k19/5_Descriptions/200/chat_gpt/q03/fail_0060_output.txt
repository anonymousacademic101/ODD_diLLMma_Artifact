The image appears to show a road within an urban area, likely part of a local street or throughway rather than an on-off ramp. On-off ramps typically connect highways/freeways with local roads and tend to have different design features such as acceleration/deceleration lanes and lack of direct access to commercial properties, which differ from what's shown in the picture where there is direct access to a parking lot on the left side.
