This appears to be an on-off ramp based on a few visual clues. First, there are solid white lines on the right, which often mark the edge of highway ramps where vehicles enter or exit freeways. Second, there is an arrow on the pavement indicating a lane that merges or diverges from the main flow of traffic, which is common on ramps. Third, the signage is yellow with an arrow indicating a curve ahead, which is typical for on-off ramps due to their curvature onto or off the highway. Lastly, the rise and bend of the road, as indicated by the road markings and surrounding environment, align with the design of an on-off ramp, which connects different road levels and has to accommodate for changes in driving speed.
