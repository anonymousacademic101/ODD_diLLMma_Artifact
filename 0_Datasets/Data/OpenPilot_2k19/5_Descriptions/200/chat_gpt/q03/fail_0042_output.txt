The road in the image appears to be a typical city street or intersection rather than an on-off ramp. On-off ramps are usually associated with highways or freeways and are designed to allow vehicles to enter or exit at high speeds. This road has crosswalks, a traffic signal, and a residential setting, which are all features more commonly found on urban streets than on freeway on-off ramps.
