The image shows a view from inside a vehicle that appears to be in a driveway or residential area in front of a house, not on an on-off ramp of a highway or freeway. On-off ramps are typically connected to highways and are designed to allow vehicles to enter or exit at certain points; this setting does not match such a description.
