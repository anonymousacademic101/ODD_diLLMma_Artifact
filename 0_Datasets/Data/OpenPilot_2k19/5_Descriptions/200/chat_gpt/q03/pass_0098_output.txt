The road in the image appears to be a regular multi-lane road, not an on-off ramp. There are multiple lanes in both directions, traffic signals, and other indicators of urban roadways such as sidewalks and street lighting. On-off ramps typically do not have these features, and they are designed to allow vehicles to enter or exit highways, not for through urban traffic with intersections controlled by traffic lights.
