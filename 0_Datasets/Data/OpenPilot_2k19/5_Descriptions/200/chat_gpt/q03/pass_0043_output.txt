The image shows a multi-lane highway with dashed lane markings consistent with a main travel lane on a highway. On-off ramps typically have solid line markings and are often single-lane structures that diverge from or merge onto the main roadway. The signs ahead also suggest that this is part of the main highway, possibly indicating exits or road information typical for main lanes rather than an on-off ramp.
