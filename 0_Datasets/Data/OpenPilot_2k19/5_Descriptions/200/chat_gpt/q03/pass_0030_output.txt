NO

The road in the image does not appear to be an on-off ramp. The visible lane markings and volume of traffic suggest it is a highway or a multi-lane road with several lanes of traffic moving in parallel, which is characteristic of main roadways rather than on-off ramps which typically consist of a single lane diverging from or merging with the highway. Additionally, the image does not clearly show any signage or road layout that typically indicates an approaching exit or entrance ramp.
