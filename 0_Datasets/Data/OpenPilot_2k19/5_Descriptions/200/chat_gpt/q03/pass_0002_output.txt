Based on the image provided, it appears that the road is not an on-off ramp but rather a highway or freeway. The multiple lanes, presence of lane markings, and the absence of any signage indicating an exit or entrance all suggest that it's a main thoroughfare rather than a ramp designed to merge onto or off of such a roadway.
