NO.

The image shows a multi-lane highway or freeway, indicated by multiple lanes for traffic moving in the same direction, separated by dashed white lines, which suggest it is a main travel route rather than an on-off ramp. On-off ramps typically have a single lane and are designed for vehicles to accelerate to join the highway (on-ramps) or decelerate when leaving it (off-ramps); they usually do not have multiple lanes unless they are part of a larger interchange or turnoff. Additionally, the road appears to traverse a longer distance without any immediate signs of an exit or entrance, which is more characteristic of a highway rather than an on-off ramp.
