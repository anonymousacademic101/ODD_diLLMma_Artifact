The road in the image appears to be a typical city street with multiple lanes and controlled by traffic lights, rather than an on-off ramp. On-off ramps are typically associated with highways or freeways and are designed to help vehicles transition between different speeds when entering or exiting a highway. This road has crosswalks, a pedestrian signal, and traffic lights, which are indicative of an urban or suburban street rather than a highway ramp.
