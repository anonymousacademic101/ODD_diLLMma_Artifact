The image shows a line of vehicles waiting, suggesting that it is a regular road or possibly an intersection rather than an on-off ramp. On-off ramps typically do not have long lines of traffic waiting at a standstill, as they are meant to facilitate the smooth flow of traffic entering or exiting highways. The presence of commercial buildings such as the visible "Verizon" store on the left also indicates that this might be an urban area with regular street traffic, not a highway on-off ramp.
