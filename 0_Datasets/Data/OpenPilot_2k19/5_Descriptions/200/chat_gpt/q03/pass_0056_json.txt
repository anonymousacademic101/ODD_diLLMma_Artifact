The solid lines between lanes lead to the conclusion that this is likely a section of a highway or a multi-lane road, as on-off ramps typically have either dashed lines signaling a place where cars can merge onto the highway or exit from it or other distinctive markings. The flow of traffic and the presence of vehicles in the process of normal highway driving, rather than merging or exiting, further support the conclusion that this is not an on-off ramp. Additionally, on-off ramps usually have a curvature or a distinctive path separate from the main lanes, which is not visible here.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
