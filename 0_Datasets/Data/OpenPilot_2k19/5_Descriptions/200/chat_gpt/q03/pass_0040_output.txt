NO.

The road in the image looks like a typical intersection, not an on-off ramp. An on-off ramp is usually associated with limited-access roads, such as highways or freeways, where traffic moves onto or off of the main lanes of travel. This intersection has traffic signal lights, crosswalks, and multiple lanes for turning, indicating it is a regular city street intersection rather than a highway interchange.
