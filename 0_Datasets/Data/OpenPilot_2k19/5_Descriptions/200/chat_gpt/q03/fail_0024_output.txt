YES

The signage visible at the side of the road appears to be indicative of exit or entrance ramp signage, as such signs are often found on on-ramps or off-ramps connecting roads to highways. Furthermore, the curvature of the road as well as the barrier on the side also suggests that it could be an on-ramp or off-ramp. However, due to the darkness and limited field of view, there's not enough information to conclusively determine the exact nature of the road. The assessment is based on common characteristics of on-off ramps and the visible signs that are typical for such road sections.
