There is a fence along the road, and a sign visible on the right, but the quality of the image and the lack of context make it difficult to definitively determine the road's purpose. However, typically, on-off ramps for highways are wider to accommodate higher-speed traffic and usually have clearer signage and markings to guide vehicles. The road in the image does not exhibit the usual characteristics of an on-off ramp, such as wide lanes or clear demarcation."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
