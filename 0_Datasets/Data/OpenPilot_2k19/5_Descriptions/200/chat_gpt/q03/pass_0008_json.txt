This assessment is based on the multiple lanes marked by lines, the visible traffic ahead traveling in the same direction, and the absence of signage or roadway design that commonly indicates an on-off ramp, such as sharper curves or exit signs. Additionally, on-off ramps typically have fewer lanes and are designated for entering or exiting a highway; here, we see a multilane road consistent with a highway or main road.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
