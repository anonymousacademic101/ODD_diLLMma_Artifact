NO

This does not appear to be an on-off ramp. The reasons are as follows:

1. Lane Width: The road has multiple lanes of travel, which is typical for a highway or a main road rather than a narrower on-off ramp.
2. Road Markings: The continuous lines and dashes typical for main roads can be seen, while on-off ramps often have different marking patterns.
3. Exit Sign: To the right, there is an exit sign indicating an upcoming off-ramp rather than being on the ramp itself.
4. Traffic: The presence of multiple vehicles in separate lanes indicates that this is a main road where traffic is flowing at what seems to be a steady speed, as opposed to merging or decelerating traffic typically seen on ramps.
