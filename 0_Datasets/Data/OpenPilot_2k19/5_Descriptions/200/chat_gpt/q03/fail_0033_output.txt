The image does not clearly show signs of a traditional on-off ramp, such as direct access to a highway or freeway. An on-off ramp typically features acceleration and deceleration lanes for merging onto or off of high-speed roadways. The road in the image appears to be a local street or road intersecting with another road, as indicated by the stop sign visible in the image. On-off ramps usually do not have stop signs as they are designed for smooth transitions between different speed zones.
