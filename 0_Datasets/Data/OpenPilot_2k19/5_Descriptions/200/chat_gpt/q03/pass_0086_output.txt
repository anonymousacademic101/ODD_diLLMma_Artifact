YES

The image shows a multi-lane road with vehicles traveling in the same direction, suggesting it is a highway or freeway. The presence of an overpass and what seems to be an exit sign indicate that this section could very well be near an on-off ramp; however, based on the flow of traffic and visible signage, it is likely not the ramp itself but a part of the freeway adjacent to it, suggesting an area close to where ramps would merge onto or exit the freeway.
