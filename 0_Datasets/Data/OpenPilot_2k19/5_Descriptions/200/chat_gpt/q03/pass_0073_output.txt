NO.

The road in the image appears to be a multi-lane freeway or highway. On-off ramps typically consist of a single lane of traffic diverging from or converging with the main roadway, often marked by solid white lines or arrows indicating the direction of travel for entering or exiting traffic. In the image, we see multiple lanes of traffic continuing straight, with no clear indicators of an on-off ramp in the immediate vicinity. The presence of overhead signs suggests that this section of road is for through traffic on the freeway, possibly with exit ramps nearby, but the road we are on is not an on-off ramp itself.
