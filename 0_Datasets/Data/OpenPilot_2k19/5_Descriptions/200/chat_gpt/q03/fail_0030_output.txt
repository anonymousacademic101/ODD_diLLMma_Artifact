NO.

The road appears to be a regular intersection and not an on-off ramp. There is a traffic signal present, and we can see vehicles directly opposite the viewer's position, indicating that it's a standard crossroad rather than a ramp, which usually does not have traffic lights and does not facilitate direct crossing traffic. Additionally, the road layout and the presence of sidewalks suggest urban or suburban road design rather than highway-related infrastructure.
