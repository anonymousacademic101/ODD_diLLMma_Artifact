On-off ramps typically lead directly to and from high-speed highways or freeways and do not usually have signs directing to local destinations that are not related to the highway/freeway system. Additionally, there are pedestrian crossing signs and signals, indicating a more urban or residential area rather than a highway interchange.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
