YES.

The lane we are in appears to diverge from the main flow of traffic to the right, which is characteristic of an on-ramp or off-ramp designed for vehicles to enter or exit a highway. The solid white line on the left of this lane and the dashed line on the right delineating this lane from the others supports this observation as it indicates restricted lane changes, which is common for entrance and exit lanes on highways.
