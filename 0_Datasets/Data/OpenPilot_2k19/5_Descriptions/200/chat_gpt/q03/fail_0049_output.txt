NO

Based on the image provided, it is not definitively clear that the road you are on is an on-off ramp. The photo shows vehicles on a road at night with some lighting and signages in the background, but there aren't any clear indicators such as signage or road markings that would specifically identify the road as an on-off ramp. The road could potentially be a regular street or highway as well, but due to the lack of clear context in the image, I cannot conclusively determine if it is an on-off ramp.
