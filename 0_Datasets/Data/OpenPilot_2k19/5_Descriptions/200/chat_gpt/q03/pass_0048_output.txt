The image shows a multi-lane highway with a sign indicating an exit and the distance to another one approaching. An on-off ramp would typically be a single lane diverging from or merging onto the highway, specifically for the purposes of entering or exiting. This appears to be the main part of the highway itself, not the ramp.
