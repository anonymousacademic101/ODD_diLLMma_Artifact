There are multiple lanes with traffic traveling in the same direction, which is typical of a main travel route, rather than an on-off ramp, which generally has fewer lanes and is designed for entering or exiting a freeway. Additionally, the presence of a road sign overhead and the lack of visible signage or road design indicating an imminent exit or entrance to the highway suggests that this is a section of a standard highway.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
