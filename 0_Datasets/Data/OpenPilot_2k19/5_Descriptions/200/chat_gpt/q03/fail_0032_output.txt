The image does not clearly indicate that the road being driven on is an on-off ramp. The scene shows a road with vehicles traveling in perpendicular directions and other vehicles stopped at what appears to be a traffic signal. This suggests an intersection rather than an on-off ramp, which typically connects highways to local roads and does not involve traffic signals where highways are intersected.
