NO.

The road shown in the image looks like a multi-lane highway or freeway, rather than an on-off ramp. On-off ramps typically have a single lane, are designed for decelerating when exiting or accelerating when entering a highway, and connect the highway to local roads or other highways. The road in this image shows multiple lanes with traffic traveling at speed, consistent with a main travel route rather than an access or exit point.
