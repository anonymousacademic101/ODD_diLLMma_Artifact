The image shows a roadway with what appears to be a deceleration lane on the right side, often found at the approach to an off-ramp from a highway. While the resolution is not high enough to see the details, the presence of dashed lines marking this lane on the right is typical of the design of an exit lane leading to an off-ramp, suggesting that this could indeed be an on-off ramp.
