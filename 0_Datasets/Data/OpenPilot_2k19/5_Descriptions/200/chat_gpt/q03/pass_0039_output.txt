NO.

The road in the image appears to be a multi-lane highway or a main road, not an on-off ramp. On-off ramps typically have a single lane or occasionally two lanes and are designed to allow vehicles to enter or exit highways. This road has multiple lanes and traffic is flowing in parallel, which is more indicative of a highway or a primary road rather than an on-off ramp.
