The image provided appears to show a parking lot rather than an on-off ramp. You can determine this by the presence of parked cars, the layout typical of parking spaces, and a stop sign which would be unusual for an on-off ramp. On-off ramps typically connect highways to local roads and do not have parking spaces or the infrastructure typical of a parking lot.
