The presence of overhead direction signs for various locations further indicates that this is a main thoroughfare and not an on-ramp or off-ramp where such extensive signage is less common. Additionally, on-off ramps typically funnel traffic from or to the main highway lanes and are not as wide, usually consisting of one or two lanes. The road we are on has multiple lanes, suggesting it is a primary part of the highway system, not an access ramp.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
