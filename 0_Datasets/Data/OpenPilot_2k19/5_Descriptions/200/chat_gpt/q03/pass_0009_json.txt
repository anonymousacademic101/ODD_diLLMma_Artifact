On-off ramps typically have a single lane and are used for entering or exiting highways, whereas the road in the image has multiple lanes and is designed for higher-speed travel, indicative of a main thoroughfare rather than a ramp. Additionally, the presence of a road sign indicating an exit ahead suggests that this is the main part of the highway, and an off-ramp may be upcoming.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
