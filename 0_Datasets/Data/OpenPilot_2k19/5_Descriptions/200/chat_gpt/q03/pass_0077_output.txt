NO.

This does not appear to be an on-off ramp. The image shows a vehicle on a multilane road that seems to be a highway or a freeway due to the presence of multiple lanes and a divider to the left separating traffic moving in the opposite direction. On-off ramps typically have a single lane or two lanes and are designed to allow vehicles to enter or exit highways, with clear indication of merging or diverging from the main flow of traffic. What we see here seems to be a regular travel lane on the highway rather than a ramp.
