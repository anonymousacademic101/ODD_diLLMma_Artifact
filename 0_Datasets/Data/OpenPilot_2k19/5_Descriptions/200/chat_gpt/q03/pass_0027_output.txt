Based on the image provided, the road appears to be a regular traffic roadway rather than an on-off ramp. There are multiple lanes of stationary traffic indicating a traffic signal is present, as we can see the red lights ahead. On-off ramps typically have merging traffic and do not usually have traffic lights or congestion as depicted in this urban traffic scenario.
