There are multiple lanes on the road, with traffic lanes demarcated by white lines, and arrows painted on the road surface which indicate the direction vehicles must follow when the light turns greenâ€”a straight arrow in the leftmost lane and a right-turn arrow in the rightmost lane.\n\nOn both sides of the road, there are pedestrian crossings, marked with zebra stripes, but there are no pedestrians visible in the image attempting to cross the street. There is also a yellow caution sign near the crosswalk on the left, potentially indicating road work or another warning, but specific details aren't discernible.\n\nThe surrounding environment is predominantly residential, with multi-storied houses or apartments on the hill in the background. Additionally, there are parked cars visible on the right side of the road, inside what appears to be a parking lot and along the curbside parking spots.\n\nThe sky is overcast, hinting at either an early morning, a cloudy day, or approaching evening time; however, precise time of day is not directly evident from the image. The overall atmosphere appears calm with little vehicular or pedestrian activity. It's important for the driver to pay attention to the traffic lights and road signs, and to be prepared to proceed when the light changes while watching for pedestrians and other vehicles."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
