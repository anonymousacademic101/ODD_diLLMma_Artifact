Here are the factual details observed:\n\n1. Time of Day: It is nighttime as indicated by the darkness and artificial lights in the image.\n2. Traffic Lights: The traffic lights are visible with red signals showing in all directions that can be seen, indicating that vehicles should be stopped at the intersection and no one should be moving through it.\n3. Road Structure: The intersection is a multi-lane roadway with what appear to be dedicated turning lanes, indicated by arrows on the road and additional signal lights for turning.\n4. Road Surface: The road surface looks dry with some visible patches or stains, perhaps oil stains. There are no visible potholes or debris.\n5. Road Signs: To the right of the image, there's a road sign visible, but its contents are not legible in the image. It is mounted on a pole at the side of the road.\n6. Traffic: There are a few vehicles visible. One of them is directly ahead and seems to be stationary due to the red traffic light. No movement is evident from the vehicles in the image.\n7. Pedestrians: There are no pedestrians visible in the image.\n8. Weather Conditions: The weather conditions cannot be determined with certainty from the image; however, there is no visible precipitation or fog.\n9. Surroundings: The area surrounding the intersection has some lights and structures that suggest a built-up area, possibly a commercial or industrial zone. There are no visible landmarks that could help in identifying the location.\n\nIt's important to note that the image quality is not high, and details are limited due to low light conditions. Therefore, some elements might not be entirely clear or detailed."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
