NO.

From the image provided, there are no clear indicators of construction work taking place on the road at the moment. The vehicles appear to be in a traffic jam, but there is no visible construction equipment, signage, barriers, or workers that would typically be present if there were construction activities underway. It is possible that construction could be a cause of the congestion, but nothing in this specific image confirms construction on the road itself.
