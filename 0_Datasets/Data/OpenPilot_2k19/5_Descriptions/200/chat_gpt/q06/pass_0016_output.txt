NO

From the perspective shown in the image, there are no visible signs of construction on the road we are driving on. There are no construction barriers, equipment, workers, or surface disruptions that would indicate road construction. However, visibility is limited to the immediate area in view, and it is not possible to see beyond the surrounding vehicles or around corners, so construction could potentially be present out of view.
