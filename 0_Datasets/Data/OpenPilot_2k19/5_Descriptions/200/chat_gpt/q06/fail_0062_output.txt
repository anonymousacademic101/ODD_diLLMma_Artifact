NO

The image provided does not appear to show a road under construction. Instead, it looks to be a parking lot with parked cars, as indicated by the lined parking spaces and the absence of construction equipment or materials. The store with a visible sign "Target" in the background suggests this is a commercial parking area, not a road undergoing construction.
