NO

Based on the image provided, there is no clear evidence of construction activity on the road. There are no visible signs such as cones, barriers, construction equipment, or workers that would typically indicate active construction. The road appears to be clear aside from standard road signage. However, the image's darkness and limited field of vision could potentially hide construction indicators beyond the immediate visibility of the camera.
