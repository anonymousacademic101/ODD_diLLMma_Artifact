The road surface also seems to be clear without any disruptions indicating construction activity. However, without a broader view or additional context, it is not possible to definitively rule out construction beyond the visible area.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
