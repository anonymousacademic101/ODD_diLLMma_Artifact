NO

From the visible evidence in the image, there are no signs of road construction such as construction equipment, workers, lane closures, barriers indicating active work zones, or construction-related signage. The traffic appears to be flowing smoothly, and the road surface looks to be in normal condition without clear indicators of ongoing construction activities.
