NO

Based on the image provided, there is no clear evidence of road construction. The scene depicts a nighttime driving environment with various lights and reflections, and while there appears to be a red reflective surface on the right, possibly indicating some form of barrier or road marking, it does not definitively indicate road construction. The image quality and field of view do not provide enough detail to confirm the presence of construction indicators such as heavy machinery, construction workers, construction materials, or explicit roadwork signs.
