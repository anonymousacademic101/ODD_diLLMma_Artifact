NO

Based on the image provided, there are no visible signs of construction on the road directly ahead. There are no construction barriers, equipment, workers, or signs indicating ongoing construction work on this section of the road. However, my assessment is limited to what is visible in this single frame, and it's possible there could be construction outside of the camera's field of view.
