NO.

Based on the image provided, there are no visible signs of construction such as construction equipment, barriers, workers, or lane closures. The lanes appear to be clear and open for traffic. However, due to the time of day (it appears to be nighttime) and the low visibility conditions, it is challenging to definitively rule out the presence of construction with absolute certainty.
