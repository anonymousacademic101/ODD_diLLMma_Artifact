NO

There is no visible evidence of construction in the provided image. The view is limited to the illuminated section of the road by the vehicle's headlights, and within that section, we don't see typical signs of road construction like cones, barriers, active machinery, or construction signage. However, please note that this does not guarantee that there is no construction further along the road, outside of the illuminated area or signs that might be located just out of view.
