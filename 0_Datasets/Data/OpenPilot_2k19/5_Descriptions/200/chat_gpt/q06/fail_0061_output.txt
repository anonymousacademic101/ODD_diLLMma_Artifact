NO.

The setting in the image appears to be a parking lot, not a road under construction. There are parked cars and a clear view of a storefront, specifically a "Target" store, which suggests this is a retail parking area. There are no visible signs of construction equipment, materials, barriers, or roadworks that would indicate ongoing construction on a road.
