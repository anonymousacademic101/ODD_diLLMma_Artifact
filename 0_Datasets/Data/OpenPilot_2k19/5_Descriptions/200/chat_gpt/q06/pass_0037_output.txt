NO.

Based on the image provided, there is no visible construction activity on the road. There are no signs of construction equipment, workers, barriers, or road work signs that would typically indicate ongoing construction. The traffic appears to be flowing smoothly, without any disruptions that might be caused by construction. However, it should be noted that the image shows only a portion of the road at a specific moment in time, and I cannot provide information beyond what is visible in the image.
