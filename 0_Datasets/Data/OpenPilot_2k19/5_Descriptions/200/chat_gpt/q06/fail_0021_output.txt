NO.

Based on the image provided, there are no apparent signs of road construction, such as construction equipment, barriers, cones, or workers, in the visible area of the road we are driving on. The image only shows a view of a road at night from inside a vehicle, with traffic lights and other vehicles in the distance. The road surface also seems to be clear without any disruptions indicating construction activity. However, without a broader view or additional context, it is not possible to definitively rule out construction beyond the visible area.
