NO

From this image, there are no visible signs of road construction. The road appears clear of construction equipment, barriers, or any roadwork signs that would indicate ongoing construction. However, it's important to note that the camera's view might not cover all angles, and construction could be present just out of view. But based on what is visible, there appears to be no construction.
