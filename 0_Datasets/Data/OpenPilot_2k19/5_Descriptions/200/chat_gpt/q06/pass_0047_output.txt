In the image provided, there are no visible signs of construction on the road we are driving on. All lanes appear open and there are no construction barriers, equipment, or workers that can be seen. Traffic also seems to be flowing normally with vehicles waiting at a traffic light, which would typically be disrupted if there were construction activities taking place.
