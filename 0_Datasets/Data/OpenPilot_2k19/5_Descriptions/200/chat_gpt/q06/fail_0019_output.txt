The image does not clearly indicate any ongoing construction on the road. Instead, it appears to be a regular urban street scene at night with vehicles at a traffic stop. The available visual information, such as signage or common indicators of construction (like barriers or construction equipment), is not discernible in the provided image. Therefore, without additional context, it would not be accurate to confirm the presence of construction.
