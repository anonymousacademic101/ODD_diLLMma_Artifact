The image shows a night scene on a road with vehicles, but there are no clear visible signs of construction, such as construction equipment, barriers, signs, or ongoing work commonly associated with road construction. The view does include lane markings and a median, without obvious obstructions that would indicate construction. The quality of the image and it being taken at night make it difficult to conclusively identify any construction without additional context or signs.
