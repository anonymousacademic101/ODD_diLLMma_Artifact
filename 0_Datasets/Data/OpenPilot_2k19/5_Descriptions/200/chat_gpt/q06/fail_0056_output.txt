The image shows a typical traffic situation on a road during the night with no clear signs of construction equipment, workers, roadwork barriers, or other common indicators of road construction. The vehicles are at a standstill, which suggests traffic congestion, but this does not inherently imply that there is construction on the road. Without these usual cues, we cannot ascertain that there is construction occurring on this section of the road.
