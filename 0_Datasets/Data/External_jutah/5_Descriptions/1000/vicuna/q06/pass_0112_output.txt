Yes, there is construction on the road we are driving on.

The road is lined with tall trees on both sides, casting dappled shadows on the pavement. The houses on either side of the road are well-maintained, with neatly trimmed lawns and colorful flowers blooming in the gardens. The street is quiet, with only the occasional car passing by.

As we drive down the road, we can see that there is construction going on. There are construction vehicles and equipment parked on the side of the road, and we can see workers in orange vests moving around, carrying tools and materials. The construction seems to be focused on repairing the road surface, as there are large patches of asphalt being laid down in sections.

It's clear that this is an ongoing project, as there are signs warning drivers to slow down and be aware of construction ahead. Despite the construction, the road is still passable, and we can see cars and trucks navigating around the work areas.

Overall, the road we are driving on appears to be well-maintained, with beautiful trees lining the sides and construction underway to improve the surface.
