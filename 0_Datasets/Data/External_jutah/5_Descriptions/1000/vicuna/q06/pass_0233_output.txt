Yes, there is construction on the road we are driving on.

The image shows a busy city street with tall buildings on either side and a crosswalk in the middle. There are several people crossing the street, including a man in a suit and tie, a woman in a coat and scarf, and a group of businessmen in suits and ties. There are also several cars parked on the side of the road.

Based on this image, it appears that there is construction on the road we are driving on. There are construction cones and barriers in the middle of the crosswalk, and there are also construction vehicles and equipment on the side of the road. It is likely that the construction is being done on the road itself, as there are no visible construction sites on the buildings in the image.
