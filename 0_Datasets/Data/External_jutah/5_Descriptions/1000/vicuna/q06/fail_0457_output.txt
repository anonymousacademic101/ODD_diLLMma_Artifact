Yes, there is construction on the road we are driving on.

The image shows a busy street with palm trees lining both sides of the road. There are several cars parked on the side of the road and a few pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The buildings on either side of the road appear to be commercial, with shops and restaurants visible from the windows. There is a construction site on the right side of the road, with equipment and materials scattered around the area.
