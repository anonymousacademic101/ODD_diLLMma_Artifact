Yes, there is construction on the road we are driving on.

The image shows a busy city street with tall buildings on both sides of the road. There are several vehicles driving on the road, including a white van in the center of the image. There are also several pedestrians walking on the sidewalk, and some of them are crossing the street. The road appears to be under construction, as there are construction cones and barriers on the side of the road.
