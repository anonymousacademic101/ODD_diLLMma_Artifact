Yes, there is construction on the road we are driving on.

The road we are driving on appears to be a city street with tall buildings on either side. There are construction cones and barriers on the road, indicating that there is some kind of construction or maintenance work being done on the road. It's possible that the road is being repaved or resurfaced, or that there are utility work being done underground. It's also possible that there is some kind of event or festival happening in the area, which would explain the presence of barriers and construction cones.
