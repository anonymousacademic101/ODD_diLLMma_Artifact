Yes, the road we are driving on has construction.

The image shows a city street at night with tall buildings on either side of the road. There are streetlights on both sides of the road, and there are cars parked on the side of the road. The buildings have windows that are lit up, and there are people walking on the sidewalk. There is a crosswalk in the middle of the road, and there is a stop sign on the corner of the intersection. The road appears to be in good condition, with no visible potholes or construction.
