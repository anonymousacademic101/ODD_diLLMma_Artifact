Yes, there is construction on the road we are driving on.

The image shows a busy street with cars driving on it, and there are construction barriers and equipment on the side of the road. It appears that there is some kind of construction or renovation work being done on the building in the background, which has a yellow and black facade with large windows. There are also several other buildings visible in the background, some of which appear to be under construction as well.
