Yes, there is construction on the road we are driving on.

The image shows a city street at night, with tall buildings on either side of the road and streetlights illuminating the area. There are cars driving on the road and a pedestrian crossing the street. It appears that there is construction happening on the road, as there are cones and barriers blocking off part of the road, and there are workers in orange vests directing traffic.
