No, there is no construction on the road we are driving on.

The image shows a city street with tall buildings on either side and a road running through the middle. There are no construction barriers or equipment visible on the road. The street is empty except for a few parked cars and a few people walking on the sidewalk. The buildings have storefronts with various signs and advertisements, but there is no indication of any construction happening in the area.
