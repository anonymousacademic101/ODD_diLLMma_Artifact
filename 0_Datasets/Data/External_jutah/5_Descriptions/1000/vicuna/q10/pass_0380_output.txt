This is a photograph of a city street at night. The street is lined with tall buildings on both sides, with streetlights illuminating the area. The road surface appears to be made of asphalt and there are no visible road markings or signs. There are no vehicles or pedestrians visible in the image. The time of day appears to be night, as the sky is dark and there are no visible sunlight or shadows.
