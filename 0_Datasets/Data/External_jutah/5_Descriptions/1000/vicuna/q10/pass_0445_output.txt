This image shows a city street at dusk, with tall buildings on either side. The road is straight and wide, with multiple lanes for traffic. There are streetlights on both sides of the road, casting a warm orange glow in the evening light. Cars and trucks are driving on the road, some in the left lane, some in the right lane, and some in the middle lane. There are no pedestrians visible in the image. The time of day appears to be late afternoon or early evening, as the sun is setting behind the buildings.
