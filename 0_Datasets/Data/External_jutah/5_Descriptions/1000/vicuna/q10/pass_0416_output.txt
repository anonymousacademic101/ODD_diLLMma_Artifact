The image shows a busy city street with tall buildings on both sides of the road. The street is lined with parked cars and a few pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk. The road has two lanes, one for traffic heading north and the other for traffic heading south. There is a traffic light at the intersection, with a green light for northbound traffic, a yellow light for eastbound traffic, and a red light for southbound traffic. The buildings in the background are tall and have many windows. Some of them have advertisements on the outside. The sky is clear and blue. It appears to be a sunny day.
