There are also some pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The sky is cloudy and it seems to be a cloudy day. There are buildings on both sides of the road, some of them are high rise buildings and some are low rise buildings. The road appears to be a main road as there are traffic signals and road signs indicating the direction of the traffic. It appears to be a busy street with a lot of activity.
