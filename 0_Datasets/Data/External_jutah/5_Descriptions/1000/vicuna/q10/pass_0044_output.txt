This image shows a busy street in Miami, Florida. The street is lined with tall white buildings on both sides, with palm trees growing in front of them. There are several cars parked on the side of the road, and a few pedestrians can be seen walking on the sidewalk. A traffic light is visible in the distance, controlling the flow of traffic on the street. The time of day appears to be daytime, as there are no lights on in the buildings and the sun is shining brightly.
