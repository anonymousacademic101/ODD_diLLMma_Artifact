The image shows a busy city street with a large billboard advertisement on the side of a building. The billboard reads "Welcome to the New York City". The street is filled with cars, taxis, and pedestrians crossing the street. The time of day appears to be morning, as there are still some people walking on the street, and the sun is not fully up. The road structure is a typical city street with two lanes for traffic, a median, and crosswalks for pedestrians. There are traffic lights and road signs indicating the direction of traffic and pedestrian crossings.
