This is a photograph of a city street with tall buildings on both sides. The street appears to be empty of cars, but there are several pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The road is straight and wide, with a center line and lane markings. There are no traffic signals or signs visible in the photo. The time of day appears to be daytime, as there is plenty of natural light and the shadows of the buildings suggest that the sun is shining from the left side of the image.
