The image shows a city street with tall buildings on both sides of the road. The road has two lanes, one for traffic going in each direction. There is a stop light at the intersection, with a green light for traffic going straight, a red light for traffic turning left, and a yellow light for traffic turning right. There are no pedestrians or other vehicles visible in the image. The time of day appears to be daytime, based on the bright sunlight and shadows cast by the buildings. The weather appears to be cloudy, as there are clouds visible in the sky.
