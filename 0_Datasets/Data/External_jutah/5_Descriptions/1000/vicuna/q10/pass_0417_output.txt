This image shows a city street with a red double-decker bus driving down the center lane. The bus is heading towards the camera, and there are several other cars and trucks driving in the other lanes. The street is lined with tall trees on both sides, and there are several streetlights hanging from the overhead wires. There are also several pedestrians walking on the sidewalk, some of whom are crossing the street. The time of day appears to be daytime, as there is plenty of natural light and the shadows of the trees are long. Overall, the scene appears to be a typical city street with moderate traffic and pedestrian activity.
