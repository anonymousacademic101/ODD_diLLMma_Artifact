This is a city street at dusk, with tall buildings lining both sides of the road. The street is straight and wide, with multiple lanes for traffic. There are streetlights on both sides of the road, casting yellow light on the pavement. Cars are driving on the road, some in the left lane, some in the right lane, and some in the middle lane. There are no pedestrians visible in the image. The time of day is dusk, as the sky is dark, but there is still some light coming from the streetlights.
