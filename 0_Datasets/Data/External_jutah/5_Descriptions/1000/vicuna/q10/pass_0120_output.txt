The image shows a view of a city street with tall buildings on either side. The street is lined with trees and there are several cars parked on the side of the road. The road has two lanes, one for traffic going in each direction, and there are traffic lights controlling the flow of traffic. There are several pedestrians walking on the sidewalk, some of whom are crossing the street. The time of day appears to be during the day, as there are no lights on in the buildings and the sun is shining.
