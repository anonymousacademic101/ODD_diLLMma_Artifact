This is a photograph of a city street, taken from the perspective of a driver on the road. The street is lined with trees on both sides, and there are buildings on either side of the road as well. The road has two lanes, one for traffic going in each direction. There are traffic lights hanging from wires above the road, and there are also signs indicating the speed limit and lane markings on the road. There are several cars and trucks on the road, driving in both directions. There are also a few pedestrians on the sidewalk, walking in both directions. The time of day appears to be morning or afternoon, as there are shadows on the ground.
