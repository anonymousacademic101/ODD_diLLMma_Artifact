This image shows a view of a city street on a rainy day. The road is wet and there are no vehicles on it. The buildings on either side of the road are tall and modern, with large windows and reflective surfaces that shine in the rain. There are no people visible on the street, but there are several pedestrians walking on the sidewalks. The sky is cloudy and overcast, with no sun in sight. The time of day appears to be early morning, as there are no lights on in the buildings and the sky is still dark. There are no road signs or traffic signals visible in the image.
