This is a view of a highway in the desert, with mountains in the background. The road is straight and there are no turns or intersections in sight. There are no other vehicles on the road, but there are some pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The sky is clear and blue, with no clouds in sight. The time of day appears to be morning, as the sun is just starting to rise in the east. The temperature is likely to be cool, as it is in the desert. There are no road signs visible in this image.
