The image shows a busy city street with tall buildings on both sides of the road. The street is lined with parked cars and a few pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk. The road has two lanes, one for traffic going in each direction. There is a stop sign at the intersection, indicating that traffic must stop before proceeding. There are also traffic lights on the opposite side of the road, but they are not visible in the image. The sky is cloudy and it seems to be a cold day, as there are no people sitting outside the cafes and restaurants on the opposite side of the road.
