Cars and trucks are parked on the side of the road, and there are several pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The road has two lanes, one for each direction of traffic, and there are no visible traffic signals or stop signs. The time of day is night, and the sky is overcast, with no moon or stars visible. The image was taken from a high angle, looking down the street.
