The image shows a long, winding road that runs along the side of a steep cliff overlooking the ocean. The road is made of asphalt and has two lanes, one for each direction of traffic. There are no other vehicles on the road, and no pedestrians are visible. The sky is clear and blue, and there are no clouds in the sky. The time of day appears to be morning, as the sun is just starting to rise over the horizon. There are no road signs or other landmarks visible in the image.
