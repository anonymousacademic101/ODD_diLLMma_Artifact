This is a photograph of a city street at dusk, with tall buildings on either side and a clear blue sky in the background. The road is straight and wide, with two lanes in each direction. There are no cars or pedestrians visible in the image, but there are streetlights on both sides of the road. The time of day appears to be late afternoon or early evening, as the sun is setting in the distance. There are no road signs or intersections visible in the image.
