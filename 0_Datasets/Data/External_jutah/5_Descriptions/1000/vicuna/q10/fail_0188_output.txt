This image shows a city street on a rainy day. The street is lined with tall buildings on both sides, some of which have glass facades. There are several cars parked on the side of the road, and a few pedestrians can be seen walking on the sidewalk. The road appears to be a one-way street, with traffic traveling in one direction. There is a large overpass in the background, which appears to be a pedestrian bridge. The time of day appears to be late afternoon or early evening, as the sun is setting behind the buildings.
