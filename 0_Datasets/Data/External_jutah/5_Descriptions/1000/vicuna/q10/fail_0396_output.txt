This image shows a residential street with a row of houses on one side and a sidewalk on the other side. There are several cars parked on the street and a few people walking on the sidewalk. The houses have white siding and red roofs, and there is a large tree in the front yard of one of the houses. There is a stop sign at the intersection of the street and a street sign indicating that it is a one-way street. The time of day appears to be morning, as there is sunlight shining on the houses and the shadows of the trees are long.
