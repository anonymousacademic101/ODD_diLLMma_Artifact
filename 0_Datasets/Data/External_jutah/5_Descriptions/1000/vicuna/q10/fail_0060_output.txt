The image shows a road running along the side of a cliff overlooking the ocean. The road is narrow and winding, with a guardrail on one side and a steep drop on the other. There are no other vehicles on the road, but there are a few pedestrians walking on the sidewalk next to the road. The sky is clear and blue, and there are some clouds in the distance. The time of day appears to be morning, as the sun is just starting to rise over the horizon. There are no road signs visible in the image.
