The image shows a city street on a rainy day. The road is made of asphalt and has two lanes, one for each direction of traffic. The road is bordered by a sidewalk on one side and a row of buildings on the other side. The buildings are made of red brick and have large windows on the upper floors. There is a fire hydrant on the sidewalk and a stop sign at the intersection. There are no cars or pedestrians visible in the image. The time of day appears to be late afternoon or early evening, based on the shadows cast by the buildings.
