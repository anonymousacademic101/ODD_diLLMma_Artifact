This image shows a city street at night. The street is lined with tall buildings on both sides, some of which have windows that are illuminated from inside. The road surface appears to be made of asphalt and there are no visible road markings or signs. There are no vehicles or pedestrians visible in the image. The time of day appears to be night, as there are no lights on in the buildings and the sky is dark.
