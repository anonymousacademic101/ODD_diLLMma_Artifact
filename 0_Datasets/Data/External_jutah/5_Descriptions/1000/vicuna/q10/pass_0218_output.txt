This image shows a busy city street with several lanes of traffic, including cars, buses, and trucks. The street is lined with tall buildings on both sides, some of which have large clock towers on top. There are also several streetlights and signs along the road. The time of day appears to be during the day, as there are people walking on the sidewalks and cars are driving on the road. The weather seems to be clear and sunny, as there are no clouds in the sky.
