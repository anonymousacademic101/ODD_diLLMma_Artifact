There are streetlights hanging from the tall buildings on both sides of the road, and there are also traffic lights at intersections.

There are several vehicles on the road, including cars, buses, and trucks. Some of the vehicles are stopped at the traffic lights, while others are moving through the intersection. There are also several pedestrians on the sidewalk, some of whom are crossing the street.

The time of day appears to be during the day, as there are no lights on in the buildings and the sun is shining. The weather appears to be clear, as there are no clouds in the sky.
