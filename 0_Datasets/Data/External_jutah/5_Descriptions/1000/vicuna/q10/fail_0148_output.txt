This image shows a city street scene with tall buildings on both sides of the road. The road appears to be a one-way street with two lanes, one for each direction of traffic. There are several street lights hanging from overhead wires, indicating that this is a well-lit area at night.

There are a few pedestrians walking on the sidewalk, but no vehicles are visible in the image. It is difficult to determine the time of day from this image, as there are no shadows or other clues about the position of the sun.

Overall, this appears to be a typical city street with a mix of commercial and residential buildings, and a moderate amount of foot traffic.
