The image shows a busy city street with tall buildings on both sides of the road. The buildings are made of beige and brown bricks, with large windows and balconies. There are several palm trees lining the sidewalk, and a few cars are parked on the street. The road has a yellow line down the middle, and there are no pedestrians visible in the image. The time of day appears to be morning, as there are no shadows on the ground.
