The image shows a city street with tall buildings on both sides. The road is made of asphalt and has two lanes, one for each direction of traffic. There is a bike lane on the left side of the road, and a sidewalk on the right side for pedestrians. The road is straight and there are no intersections or crossings in sight. The sky is clear and blue, and there are no clouds. The time of day appears to be morning, as there are no shadows and the sun is shining brightly. There are no vehicles or people visible in the image.
