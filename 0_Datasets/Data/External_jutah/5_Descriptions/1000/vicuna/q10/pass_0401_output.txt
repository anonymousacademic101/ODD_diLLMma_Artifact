The image shows a city street at dusk, with tall buildings on either side of the road. The street is empty of cars, but there are a few pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The skyline of the city is visible in the distance, with skyscrapers reaching high into the sky. There are no road signs or traffic lights visible in the image. The time of day appears to be late afternoon or early evening, as the sun is setting behind the buildings.
