This is an empty street in a city with tall skyscrapers on either side. The street is lined with trees on both sides and there are no cars or pedestrians in sight. The road is straight and there are no intersections or turns in sight. The sky is clear and there is no smog or haze. The time of day appears to be morning, as the sun is shining brightly and there are no shadows on the road. The temperature is likely cool, as there are no people outside and the windows of the buildings are reflecting the sunlight.
