The image shows a busy city street with tall buildings on either side. The road is divided into multiple lanes, with traffic moving in both directions. There are several traffic lights controlling the flow of traffic. Pedestrians can be seen crossing the street at various points. The time of day appears to be during the day, as there are no lights on in the buildings and the sun is shining.
