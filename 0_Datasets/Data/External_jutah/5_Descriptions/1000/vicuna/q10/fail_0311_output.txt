This image shows a view of a city street with tall buildings on either side. The road is made of asphalt and has two lanes, one for each direction of traffic. The road is straight and there are no turns or intersections visible. There are no pedestrians or other vehicles visible in the image. The time of day is daytime, as there is sunlight shining on the buildings and the shadows are short. The weather appears to be clear, as there are no clouds visible in the sky. The image was likely taken from a high angle, as the view shows the entire length of the street and the buildings on either side.
