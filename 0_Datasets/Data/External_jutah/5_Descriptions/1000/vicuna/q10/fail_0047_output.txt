This is an image of a city street with palm trees lining both sides of the road. The road has two lanes, one for traffic going in each direction. There is a traffic light at the intersection, with a green light for traffic going straight, a red light for traffic turning left, and a yellow light for traffic turning right. There are no pedestrians or other vehicles visible in the image. The sky is clear and blue, with fluffy white clouds. The time of day appears to be morning, as the sun is shining brightly and casting long shadows on the ground.
