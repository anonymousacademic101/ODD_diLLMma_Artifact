This image shows a view of a city street with tall buildings on both sides of the road. The road has multiple lanes and is divided by a yellow line in the middle. There are several cars driving on the road, including a black SUV in the left lane and a white sedan in the right lane. There are also several pedestrians on the sidewalk, some of whom are walking in the same direction as the cars and some of whom are walking in the opposite direction. The time of day appears to be daytime, as there is plenty of natural light and the shadows of the buildings suggest that the sun is shining from the left side of the image. The weather appears to be cloudy, as there are clouds visible in the sky. Overall, this image depicts a busy city street with a mix of vehicles and pedestrians.
