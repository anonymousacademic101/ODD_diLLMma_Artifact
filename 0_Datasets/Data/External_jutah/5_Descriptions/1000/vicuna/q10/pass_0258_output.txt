This image shows a busy city street at night. The street is lined with tall buildings on both sides, some of which have neon lights illuminating their facades. There are several lanes of traffic, with cars driving in both directions. There are also pedestrians on the sidewalk, some of whom are crossing the street. A large billboard with the Eiffel Tower on it can be seen in the distance. The time of day appears to be night, as the sky is dark and there are lights from the buildings and billboard illuminating the scene.
