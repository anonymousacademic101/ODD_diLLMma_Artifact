The pavement is made of asphalt and there are no potholes or cracks visible. There are no vehicles on the road, but there are several parked cars in front of the businesses. There are several pedestrians walking on the sidewalk, but no bicycles or other vehicles are present. The time of day appears to be morning, as there are no shadows on the ground. The weather appears to be clear, as there are no clouds or other weather patterns visible in the sky.

The businesses on either side of the road include a convenience store, a barber shop, and a small grocery store. There are several signs advertising the businesses, including a neon sign for the barber shop and a banner for the grocery store. The buildings are all made of brick and have metal awnings over the entrances. There are several trees planted along the sidewalk, providing shade for pedestrians.
