This is a city street scene with tall buildings on either side of the road. The buildings are made of glass and have a modern, sleek design. There are no cars on the road, but there are several pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The time of day appears to be daytime, as there is sunlight shining on the buildings and the shadows of the pedestrians are long. There are no road signs visible in this image.
