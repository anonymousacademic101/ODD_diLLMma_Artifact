The image shows a residential street in a coastal city. The street is lined with trees on both sides and has a sidewalk for pedestrians. There are several cars parked on the side of the road, and a few more are driving down the street. The buildings on either side of the street appear to be single-family homes with large windows and balconies overlooking the ocean. The sky is clear and blue, and there are no clouds visible. It appears to be a sunny day.
