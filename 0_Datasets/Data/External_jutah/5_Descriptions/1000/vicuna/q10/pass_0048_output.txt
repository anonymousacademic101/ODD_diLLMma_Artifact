This is a view of a city street in Miami, Florida. The street is lined with tall palm trees on both sides, and there are several high-rise buildings visible in the background. The road is straight and wide, with two lanes in each direction. There are no cars or pedestrians visible in the image. The sky is clear and sunny, and there are no clouds in the sky. The time of day appears to be around midday, as the sun is high in the sky. The temperature is likely warm, as there are no leaves on the palm trees, and the buildings do not have any air conditioning units visible.
