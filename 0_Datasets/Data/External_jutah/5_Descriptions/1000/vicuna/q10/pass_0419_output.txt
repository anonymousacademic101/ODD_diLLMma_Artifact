The image shows a busy city street with tall buildings on both sides of the road. The street is lined with parked cars and a few pedestrians can be seen crossing the street. There is a stop sign on the left side of the road and a yield sign on the right side. The road appears to be a one-way street, with traffic moving in one direction. The time of day appears to be during the day, as there are many people and cars on the street.
