The image shows a city street with palm trees lining both sides of the road. The buildings on the left side of the street are multi-story residential buildings with balconies and windows. The buildings on the right side of the street are commercial, with shops and restaurants on the ground floor and offices on the upper floors. There is a traffic light at the intersection, and several cars are parked on the street. There are no pedestrians visible in the image. The time of day appears to be late afternoon or early evening, as the sun is setting behind the buildings.
