This is a street view of a city block with several buildings on either side of the road. The buildings appear to be commercial in nature, with large windows and white facades. There are several palm trees lining the sidewalk, and a few parked cars can be seen along the curb. The road has two lanes in each direction, with a center median and streetlights. There are no pedestrians visible in this image. The time of day appears to be daytime, as there are no lights on in the buildings and the sun is shining brightly.
