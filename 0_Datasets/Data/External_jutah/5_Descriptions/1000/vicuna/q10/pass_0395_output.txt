The image shows a view of a city street at dusk. The street is lined with tall trees on both sides, casting long shadows on the pavement. The road is straight and wide, with two lanes in each direction. There are no cars or pedestrians visible in the image, but there are streetlights on both sides of the road, illuminating the area. In the distance, the skyline of a city can be seen, with tall buildings and a few clouds. The sun is setting behind the buildings, casting a warm orange glow over the scene.
