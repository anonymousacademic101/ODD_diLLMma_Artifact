This is a street view of a city block with several shops on either side of the road. The shops have large glass windows and black awnings with the brand name "Burberry" written on them. There are several trees lining the sidewalk, and a few people are walking on the sidewalk. The road has a yellow line down the middle, and there are parking spots on either side of the road. There are no traffic signals or signs visible in this image. The time of day appears to be daytime, as there are no lights on in the shops and the sun is shining brightly.
