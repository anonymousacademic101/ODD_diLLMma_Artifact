The image shows a busy city street with tall buildings on both sides. The road is made of asphalt and has two lanes, one for each direction of traffic. There are no cars or pedestrians visible in the image, but there are several road signs, including a stop sign and a speed limit sign. The buildings in the background are tall and made of concrete and glass, with metal scaffolding on some of them. It appears to be a sunny day, as there are no clouds in the sky.
