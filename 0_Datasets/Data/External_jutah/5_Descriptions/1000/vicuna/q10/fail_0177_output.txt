This image shows a city street on a rainy day. The street is wet and there are puddles of water on the road. There are several cars parked on the side of the road, and a few pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk. There is a traffic light at the intersection, and the light is red. The buildings on either side of the street are tall and made of concrete or brick. There are several trees lining the sidewalk, and some of them have leaves that are starting to turn yellow. The time of day appears to be late afternoon or early evening, based on the position of the sun in the sky.
