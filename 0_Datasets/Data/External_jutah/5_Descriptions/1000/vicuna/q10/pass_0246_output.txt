This image shows a view of a city street at dusk. The street is lined with tall buildings on both sides, some of which have illuminated signs. There are a few cars parked on the side of the road, and some pedestrians can be seen walking on the sidewalk. The time of day is dusk, and the sky is a mix of pink, orange, and blue hues. The road surface appears to be smooth and well-maintained. There are no visible road signs or traffic signals in the image.
