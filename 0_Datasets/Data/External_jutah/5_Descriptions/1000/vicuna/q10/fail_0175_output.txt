This is a busy city street on a rainy day. The road is made of asphalt and has two lanes for traffic, one in each direction. There are yellow lines down the center of the road and green street signs indicating the direction of traffic. The buildings on either side of the road are made of red brick and have large windows. There are people walking on the sidewalk, some carrying umbrellas to protect themselves from the rain. Cars and trucks are driving on the road, some with their windshield wipers on to clear the rain from their windows. The time of day is morning, and the lighting is dim due to the overcast sky.
