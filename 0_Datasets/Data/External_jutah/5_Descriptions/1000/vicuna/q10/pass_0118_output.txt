This is a residential street with trees lining both sides of the road. There are several cars parked on the side of the road and a few pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The buildings on either side of the street appear to be apartment complexes with balconies and windows facing the street. The time of day appears to be late morning or early afternoon, as the sun is shining brightly and casting shadows on the ground. There are no road signs or traffic signals visible in the image.
