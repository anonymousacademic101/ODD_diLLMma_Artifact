This is a street view of a city street in Miami, Florida. The street is lined with tall buildings on both sides, some of which have white and blue awnings. There are several cars parked on the street, and some are driving on the road. There are also several pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The sky is clear and blue, and there are palm trees lining the street. The time of day appears to be during the day, as there is sunlight shining on the buildings and the shadows of the palm trees are long.
