The image shows a view of a city street on a rainy day. The street is lined with tall buildings on both sides, some of which have balconies. There are several cars parked on the side of the road, and some are driving on the road. There are also several pedestrians on the sidewalk, some of whom are holding umbrellas to protect themselves from the rain. The time of day appears to be late afternoon or early evening, as the sun is setting behind the buildings.
