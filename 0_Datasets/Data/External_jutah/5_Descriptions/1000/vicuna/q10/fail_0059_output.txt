This image shows a road running along the side of a cliff overlooking the ocean. The road is narrow and winding, with a guardrail on one side and a steep drop on the other. There are no other vehicles on the road, but there are a few pedestrians walking on the sidewalk next to the road. The sky is clear and blue, and there are no clouds in sight. It appears to be a sunny day. There are no road signs or traffic lights in the image.
