The image shows a busy city street with tall buildings on both sides of the road. The street is lined with palm trees, and there are several crosswalks for pedestrians to cross the road. The road has two lanes for traffic in each direction, and there are traffic lights controlling the flow of traffic. There are several parked cars on the side of the road, and a few people can be seen walking on the sidewalk. The time of day appears to be daytime, as there are no lights on in the buildings and the sun is shining.
