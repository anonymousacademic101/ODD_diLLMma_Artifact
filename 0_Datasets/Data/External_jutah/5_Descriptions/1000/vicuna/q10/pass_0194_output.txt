The image shows a view of a city street on a rainy day. The street is lined with tall buildings on both sides, some of which have red and white striped awnings. There are several cars parked on the side of the road, and a few cars are driving down the street. There are also several pedestrians walking on the sidewalk, some of whom are holding umbrellas to protect themselves from the rain. The road is wet and there are puddles of water on the pavement. The time of day is morning, and the lighting is dim due to the overcast sky.
