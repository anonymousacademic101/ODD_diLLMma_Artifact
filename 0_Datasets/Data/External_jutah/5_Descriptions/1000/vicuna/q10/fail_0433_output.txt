The image shows a city street at night. The street is lined with tall buildings on both sides and there are streetlights illuminating the area. There are several cars parked on the side of the road, and a few pedestrians can be seen walking on the sidewalk. The road has two lanes, one for each direction of traffic, and there is a stoplight at the intersection. The time of day appears to be late evening or night, as the sky is dark and there are no visible sunlight or shadows.
