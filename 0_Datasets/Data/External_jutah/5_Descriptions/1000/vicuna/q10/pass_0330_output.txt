This is a view of a city street with several rows of parked cars on either side of the road. The cars are parked parallel to the curb, and there are no cars driving on the road. The road surface appears to be asphalt, and there are no visible road markings or signs. The buildings on either side of the street are multi-story brick structures with storefronts on the ground floor. There are several pedestrians walking on the sidewalk, and there are no visible bicycles or other vehicles on the road. The time of day appears to be daytime, as there are no lights on the street or in the buildings.
