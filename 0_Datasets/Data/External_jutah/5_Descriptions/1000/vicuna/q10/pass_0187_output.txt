This image shows a city street on a rainy day. The street is lined with tall buildings on both sides, and there are several cars and buses driving on the road. The road has two lanes, one for traffic going in each direction. There is a traffic light at the intersection, with a red light for the cars and a green light for the bus. There are also several pedestrians on the sidewalk, some of whom are holding umbrellas to protect themselves from the rain. The time of day appears to be late afternoon or early evening, as the sun is setting behind the buildings.
