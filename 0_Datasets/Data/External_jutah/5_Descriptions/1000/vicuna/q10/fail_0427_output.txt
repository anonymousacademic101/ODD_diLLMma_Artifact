This is a photograph of a city street at night. The street is lined with tall buildings on both sides, and there are streetlights illuminating the area. The road is straight and wide, with two lanes in each direction. There are no pedestrians visible in the image, but there could be some present in the real-life scene. The time of day appears to be night, as the sky is dark, and the streetlights are on. There are no road signs visible in the image, but there could be some present in the real-life scene.
