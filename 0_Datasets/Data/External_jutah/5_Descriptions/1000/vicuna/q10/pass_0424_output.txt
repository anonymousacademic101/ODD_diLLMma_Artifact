This is a view of a highway with palm trees lining both sides of the road. The road is straight and goes towards the horizon. There are no vehicles on the road, but there are some pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The sky is clear and blue, and there are no clouds in the sky. The sun is shining brightly, and there are no shadows on the road. It appears to be a sunny day. There are some buildings visible in the distance, but it is not clear what they are. There is a large body of water visible in the distance, but it is not clear what it is. It could be a river or a lake. There are no road signs visible in this image.
