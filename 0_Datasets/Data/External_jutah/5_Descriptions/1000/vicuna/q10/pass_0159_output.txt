The road has two lanes, one for each direction of traffic, and there is a white line down the middle of the road. There are no traffic signals or signs visible in the image. The time of day appears to be daytime, as there are no lights on in the buildings and the sun is shining brightly. Overall, it appears to be a typical city street with a mix of commercial and residential buildings.
