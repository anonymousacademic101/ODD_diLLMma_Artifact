This is a view of a busy city street with tall buildings on either side of the road. The street is lined with parked cars and a few pedestrians can be seen crossing the road. There is a traffic light at the intersection and a green bus is stopped at the bus stop. The time of day appears to be daytime, as there are no lights on in the buildings and the sun is shining.
