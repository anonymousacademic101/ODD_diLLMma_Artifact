This is a view of a city street with tall buildings on either side. There are several cars parked on the side of the road and a few people walking on the sidewalk. The road has two lanes, one for traffic going in each direction, and there are traffic lights at the intersection. The buildings are made of brick and have large windows on the upper floors. There are several signs on the buildings, including advertisements and directional signs. It appears to be a busy city street with a mix of commercial and residential buildings.
