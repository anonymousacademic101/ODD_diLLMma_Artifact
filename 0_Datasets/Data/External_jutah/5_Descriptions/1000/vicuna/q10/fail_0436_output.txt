This image shows a city street at night, with streetlights illuminating the road and surrounding area. The road appears to be a multi-lane highway, with two lanes in each direction separated by a median. There are no cars or pedestrians visible in the image, but there are road cones and barriers set up on the road, indicating some sort of construction or maintenance work is being done. The time of day is difficult to determine from the image, but it appears to be dark, with no visible moon or stars in the sky.
