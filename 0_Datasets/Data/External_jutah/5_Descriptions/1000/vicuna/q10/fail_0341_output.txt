This is a street view of a city block with several buildings on either side of the street. The buildings are made of red brick and have large windows on the upper floors. The street is lined with trees and there are several cars parked on the side of the road. There are also several people walking on the sidewalk, some of them carrying shopping bags. The time of day appears to be during the day, as there is sunlight visible in the image. There are no road signs visible in this image.
