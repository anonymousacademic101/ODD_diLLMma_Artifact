This is a photo of a city street on a rainy day. The road is wet and there are cars driving on it. There are buildings on either side of the street and a few pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The time of day appears to be late afternoon or early evening, based on the shadows cast by the buildings. There are no road signs or traffic signals visible in the photo.
