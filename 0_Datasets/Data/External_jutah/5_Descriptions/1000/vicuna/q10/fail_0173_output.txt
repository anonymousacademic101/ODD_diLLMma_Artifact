This is a photo of a city street on a rainy day. The street is lined with tall buildings on both sides, some of which have large arched windows. The road surface is wet from the rain, and there are no cars or pedestrians visible in the image. The time of day is likely morning or afternoon, as the sun is not visible in the image, but the shadows of the buildings suggest that the sun is not directly overhead. There are no road signs or traffic signals visible in the image.
