The image shows a city street scene with tall buildings on both sides of the road. The road appears to be a one-way street with two lanes, one for each direction of traffic. There is a green traffic light on the left side of the road, indicating that traffic in that direction is allowed to proceed. On the right side of the road, there is a red stop light, indicating that traffic in that direction is stopped.

There are several pedestrians on the sidewalk, some of whom are walking in the same direction as the traffic, while others are walking in the opposite direction. There are also a few parked cars on the side of the road.

The buildings in the image are made of red brick and have large windows on the upper floors. Some of the buildings have signs on them, but it is not possible to read what the signs say from this angle.

It appears to be a sunny day, as there are no clouds visible in the sky. The sun is shining down on the road and the buildings, casting long shadows on the sidewalk.

Overall, the image shows a typical city street scene with tall buildings, a mix of parked cars and pedestrians, and a green traffic light indicating that traffic is allowed to proceed in one direction.
