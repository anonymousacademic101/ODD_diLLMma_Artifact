The image shows a city street with tall buildings on both sides. The street is empty except for a man walking on the sidewalk. The man is wearing a white shirt and black pants, and he has a backpack on his back. There is a crosswalk in the middle of the street, and a traffic light hanging above it. The light is red, indicating that it is not safe to cross the street. On the left side of the street, there is a row of parked cars, and on the right side, there is a row of trees. The sky is clear and blue, and there are no clouds in sight. It appears to be a sunny day.
