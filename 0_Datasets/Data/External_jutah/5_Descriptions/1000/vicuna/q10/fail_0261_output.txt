The image shows a busy city street with tall buildings on both sides of the road. There are several cars parked on the side of the road and a few pedestrians crossing the street. The road has a yellow line down the middle and there is a stop sign on the left side of the road. The buildings have different colors and designs, with some having balconies and others not. The sky is cloudy and it seems to be around dusk or dawn.
