The image shows a busy city street on a rainy day. The street is lined with tall buildings on both sides, some of which have clock towers. There are several lanes of traffic, including cars, trucks, and buses, traveling in both directions. The road surface is wet from the rain, and there are puddles on the street. There are also several pedestrians on the sidewalk, some of whom are holding umbrellas to protect themselves from the rain. The time of day is likely morning or afternoon, as there are still some people on the street, but it is not crowded.
