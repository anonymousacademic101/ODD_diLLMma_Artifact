This image shows a stretch of a city street lined with parked cars on both sides. The road is straight and has two lanes, one for each direction of traffic. The pavement is made of asphalt and has a yellow line down the middle to separate the lanes. There are no pedestrians visible in the image, but there could be some on the sidewalk on the other side of the road. The time of day appears to be daytime, as there are no streetlights visible. The buildings on either side of the road are multi-story residential buildings with large windows and balconies. There are trees growing along the side of the road, some of which are casting shadows on the pavement.
