This is a view of a city street with tall buildings on either side. The road is straight and there are no turns or intersections in sight. There are several cars driving on the road, some of which are in the left lane and some in the right lane. There are also several pedestrians on the sidewalk, some of whom are walking and some of whom are standing still. The sky is clear and sunny, and there are no clouds in the sky. The time of day appears to be late morning or early afternoon, as the sun is high in the sky but not directly overhead. There are no other notable features in the image.
