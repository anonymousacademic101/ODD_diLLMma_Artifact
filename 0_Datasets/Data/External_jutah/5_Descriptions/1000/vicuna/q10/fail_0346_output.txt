This is a view of a city street with tall buildings on either side. There are several cars parked on the side of the road and a few pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The road has two lanes in each direction and there are traffic lights at the intersection. The time of day appears to be daytime, as there are no lights on in the buildings and the sun is shining. There are no road signs visible in this image.
