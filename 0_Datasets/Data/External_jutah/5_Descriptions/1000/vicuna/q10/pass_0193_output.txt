This is a photograph of a city street on a rainy day. The street is lined with tall buildings on both sides, some of which have reflective glass facades. The road surface is wet and there are no cars or pedestrians visible in the image. The sky is cloudy and overcast, with no sun in sight. The time of day appears to be morning or early afternoon, as there are no lights on in the buildings and the shadows are long. There are no road signs or traffic signals visible in the image.
