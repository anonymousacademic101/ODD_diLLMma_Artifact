The image shows a city street scene with buildings on both sides of the road. The road appears to be a one-way street with two lanes, one for each direction of traffic. There is a traffic light at the intersection, with a green light for the left lane and a red light for the right lane. There are no pedestrians visible in the image. The time of day appears to be daytime, as there are no lights on in the buildings and the sky is visible.
