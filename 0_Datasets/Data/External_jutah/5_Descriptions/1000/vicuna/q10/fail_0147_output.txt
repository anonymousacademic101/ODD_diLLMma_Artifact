This image shows a busy city street with tall buildings on either side. The street is lined with parked cars and a few pedestrians can be seen crossing the street. There is a traffic light controlling the flow of traffic on the street. The buildings have large windows and appear to be commercial or office spaces. The time of day appears to be during the day, as there are no lights on in the buildings and the sun is shining.
