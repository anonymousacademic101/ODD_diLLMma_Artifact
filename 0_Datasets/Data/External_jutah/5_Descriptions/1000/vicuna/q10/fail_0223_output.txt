This is a photo of a city street on a rainy day. The street is lined with tall buildings on both sides, some of which have glass facades. The road surface is wet and there are no cars or pedestrians visible in the image. There are streetlights and traffic lights on the corners of the intersection, but no cars are stopped at them. The time of day is likely morning or afternoon, as the sun is not visible in the image, but the shadows of the buildings suggest that it is not night.
