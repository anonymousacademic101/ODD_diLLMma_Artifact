This is a street view of a city street with tall buildings on either side. The street is lined with palm trees and there are several cars parked on the side of the road. There are also several pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The time of day appears to be daytime, as there is sunlight shining on the buildings and the shadows of the palm trees are long. There are no road signs visible in this image.
