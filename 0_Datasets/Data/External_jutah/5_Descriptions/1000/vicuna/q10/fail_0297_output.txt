The image shows a street view of a city street with buildings on both sides. The road has two lanes, one for each direction of traffic. There is a white pickup truck driving in the left lane and a few cars parked on the side of the road. The buildings have large windows and appear to be made of concrete and steel. There are no road signs or pedestrians visible in the image. The time of day appears to be daytime, as there are no lights on the street or in the buildings. The sky is clear and blue.
