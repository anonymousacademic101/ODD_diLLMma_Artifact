This is a street view image of a city block in a downtown area. The buildings on either side of the street are made of brick and have large windows. There are several cars parked on the street and a few pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. There is a traffic light at the intersection and a stop sign on the corner of the street. The time of day appears to be during the day, as there are no lights on in the buildings and the sun is shining brightly.
