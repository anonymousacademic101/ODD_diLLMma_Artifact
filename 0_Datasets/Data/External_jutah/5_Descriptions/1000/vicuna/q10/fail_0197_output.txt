This is an image of a city street on a rainy day. The road is wet and there are no cars on it. There is a stop light at the intersection, but no traffic is visible. The buildings on either side of the street are old and run down, with broken windows and graffiti on the walls. There are no pedestrians in sight. The time of day appears to be late afternoon or early evening, based on the position of the sun in the sky. The weather is cloudy and rainy, with water puddles on the road.
