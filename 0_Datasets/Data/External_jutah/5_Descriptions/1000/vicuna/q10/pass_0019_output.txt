This is a view of a city street with tall buildings on either side. The street is empty of cars, but there are several pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The buildings are made of brick and have large windows on the upper floors. There are no road signs or traffic lights visible in the image. The time of day appears to be late afternoon, as the sun is setting behind the buildings.
