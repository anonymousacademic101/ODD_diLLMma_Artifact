The image shows a city street with tall buildings on either side of the road. The buildings have many windows and appear to be made of concrete and steel. There are trees lining the sidewalk and a few parked cars can be seen on the street. The sky appears to be cloudy.

Based on the image, it is difficult to determine whether the visibility is poor or not. However, it can be assumed that the sky is cloudy, which can make it difficult to see things far away. Additionally, the tall buildings on either side of the road may obstruct the view of things in the distance. Therefore, it can be said that the visibility is poor due to the cloudy sky and tall buildings.
