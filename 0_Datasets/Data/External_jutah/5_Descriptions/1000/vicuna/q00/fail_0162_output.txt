The image shows a busy city street with tall buildings on both sides of the road. The buildings have large windows that allow natural light to enter, but it is difficult to determine whether the visibility is poor or not from this image alone. Factors such as heavy rain, snow, fog, or adverse weather conditions could affect visibility, but they are not present in this image.
