The image shows a city street with tall buildings on either side and a car driving down the center of the street. The buildings have scaffolding on them, suggesting that construction or repair work is being done. The street appears to be empty of other vehicles, and there are no pedestrians visible.

Based on this image, it is difficult to determine whether the visibility is poor or not. The image does not show any weather conditions that would affect visibility, such as heavy rain, snow, fog, or adverse weather conditions. However, it is possible that the visibility may be poor due to the construction work on the buildings, which could create a lot of dust and debris in the air. Additionally, the lack of other vehicles and pedestrians on the street could indicate that the area is closed off for construction or some other reason, which could also affect visibility.
