The image shows a busy street with palm trees lining both sides of the road. There are several parked cars and a few pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The sky appears to be clear and sunny.

Based on the image, it appears that the visibility is good. There are no adverse weather conditions such as heavy rain, snow, fog, or smog that would impede visibility. The palm trees provide some shade, but they do not block the view of the buildings or the road. The clear sky allows for good visibility in all directions.

Therefore, the answer is YES.
