The image shows a black truck parked on the side of the road in front of a large building with many windows. The building appears to be made of brick and has several floors. There are trees on either side of the road and a grassy area in the foreground. It is raining heavily in the image, with large drops of water visible on the windshield of the truck and on the ground. The visibility is poor due to the heavy rain, making it difficult to see the building and the surrounding area.
