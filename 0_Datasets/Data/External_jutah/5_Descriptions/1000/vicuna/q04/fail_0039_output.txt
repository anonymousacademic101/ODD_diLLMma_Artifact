Yes, the road we are driving on is an intersection.

The image shows a busy street with a KFC restaurant on the corner of the intersection. There are several cars parked on the side of the road and a few pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The traffic light is red, indicating that it is not safe to cross the street. The palm trees on the side of the road add to the tropical atmosphere of the scene.
