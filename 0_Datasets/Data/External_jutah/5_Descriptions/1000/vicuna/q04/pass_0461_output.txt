YES, the road we are driving on is an intersection.

The image shows a busy city street at night, with tall buildings on either side of the road. The street is lined with cars driving in both directions, and there are also pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The streetlights are on, casting a bright light on the road and the surrounding area. The image is taken at night, and the sky is dark, with only the light from the streetlights illuminating the scene.
