Yes, the road we are driving on is an intersection.

The image shows a long, dark tunnel with a car driving down the center of the road. The car's headlights illuminate the road ahead, casting long shadows on the walls of the tunnel. The road appears to be straight, running horizontally across the image. There are no visible intersections or turns in the road. The walls of the tunnel are smooth and featureless, with no visible openings or exits. The lighting in the tunnel is dim, with only the headlights of the car providing any illumination. The overall atmosphere of the image is dark and foreboding, with a sense of mystery and uncertainty about what lies ahead.
