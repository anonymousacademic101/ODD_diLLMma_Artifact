YES, the road we are driving on is an intersection.

The image shows a person riding a bicycle down a city street at night. The street is lined with tall buildings on both sides, and there are streetlights illuminating the area. The person is wearing a white shirt and black pants, and they are riding a green bicycle with white wheels. The bicycle has a white basket on the front, and the person is holding onto the handlebars with both hands. The street is empty except for the person and their bicycle, and there are no other vehicles or pedestrians in sight. The image is taken at night, and the sky is dark, with only the light from the streetlights illuminating the area.
