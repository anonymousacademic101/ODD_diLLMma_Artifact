YES, the road we are driving on is an intersection.

The image shows a view of a road with cars driving on it. The cars are driving on the left side of the road and there is a divider in the middle of the road. On the right side of the road, there are buildings and trees that can be seen in the background. The sky appears to be cloudy, and the sun is shining through the clouds, casting shadows on the road and the cars. The image is taken from a high angle, looking down on the road and the cars.
