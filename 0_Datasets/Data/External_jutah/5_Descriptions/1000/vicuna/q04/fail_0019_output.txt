Yes, the road we are driving on is an intersection.

The image shows a busy city street with cars driving on it. There are buildings on both sides of the road, and some of them have Amazon delivery trucks parked outside. The sky is cloudy, and there are trees and other buildings visible in the background. The road appears to run horizontally across the image.
