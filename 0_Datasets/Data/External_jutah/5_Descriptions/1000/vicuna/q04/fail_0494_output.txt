YES, the road we are driving on is an intersection.

The image shows a busy city street at night with a lot of traffic, including cars, buses, and taxis. The street is lined with neon-lit billboards and advertisements, and there are people walking on the sidewalks. The road appears to run horizontally across the image, as there are no visible intersections or turns in the road.
