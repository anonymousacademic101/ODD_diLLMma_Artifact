Yes, the road we are driving on is an intersection.

The image shows a busy city street with several tall buildings on either side of the road. There are several cars parked on the side of the road, and several people are walking on the sidewalk. There is a crosswalk in the middle of the road, and a traffic light hanging above it. On the other side of the road, there are several shops and restaurants with outdoor seating areas. The buildings in the background are tall and beige, with large windows and balconies on the upper floors. There are also several trees lining the street, providing shade for the pedestrians and drivers.
