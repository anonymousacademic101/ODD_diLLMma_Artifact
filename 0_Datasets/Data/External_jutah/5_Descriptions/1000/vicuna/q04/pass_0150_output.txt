Yes, the road we are driving on is an intersection.

The image shows a city street with tall buildings on either side and a road running through the center of the image. The road appears to be an intersection, as there are cars driving on it in both directions. The buildings on either side of the road are tall and appear to be made of concrete or brick. There are trees growing on the side of the road, and there are also sidewalks on either side of the road where people can walk. The sky appears to be cloudy, and there are no visible signs of sunlight.
