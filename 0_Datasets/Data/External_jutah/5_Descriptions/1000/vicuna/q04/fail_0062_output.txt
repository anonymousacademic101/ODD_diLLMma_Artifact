Yes, the road in the image runs horizontally across the image.

The image shows a red car driving down a winding road that runs along the side of a steep cliff. The road appears to be a narrow, two-lane highway with a guardrail on one side and a steep drop-off on the other. The cliff face is covered in greenery, and there are several houses visible in the distance at the top of the cliff. The sky is clear and blue, and there are no other vehicles visible on the road.
