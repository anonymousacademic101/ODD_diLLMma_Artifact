Yes, the road we are driving on is an intersection.

The image shows a red brick building with a large arched window on the second floor and a smaller arched window on the first floor. There are two trees on either side of the building, one on the left and one on the right. The road in front of the building appears to be an intersection, with cars driving on it in both directions. There is a sidewalk on the left side of the road and a grassy area on the right side.
