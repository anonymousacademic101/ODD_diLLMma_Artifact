YES, the road we are driving on is an intersection.

The image shows a busy city street at night, with several tall buildings on either side of the road. The road appears to run horizontally across the image, as there are several lanes of traffic traveling in both directions. There are also several crosswalks and intersections where drivers must stop and wait for pedestrians to cross. The buildings in the background are tall and modern, with large windows and reflective surfaces that catch the light of the street lamps. The cars on the road are a mix of sedans, SUVs, and trucks, all traveling at different speeds and in different directions. Overall, the image gives a sense of the hustle and bustle of city life at night.
