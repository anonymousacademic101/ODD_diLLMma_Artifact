Yes, the road we are driving on is an intersection.

The image shows a busy city street with tall buildings on both sides of the road. The road appears to run horizontally across the image, as there are cars driving on it in both directions. There are also pedestrians walking on the sidewalks and a van parked on the right side of the road.
