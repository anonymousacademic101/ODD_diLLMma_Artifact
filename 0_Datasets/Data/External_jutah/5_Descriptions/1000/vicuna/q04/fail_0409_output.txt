Yes, the road we are driving on is an intersection.

The image shows a city street with buildings on both sides of the road and a large archway in the distance. The archway appears to be made of stone and has decorative carvings on it. There are several vehicles driving on the road, including a small electric car and a larger truck. There are also several pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The buildings on either side of the road have different architectural styles, with some having balconies and others having large windows. The street is lined with trees and there are utility poles and streetlights along the side of the road.
