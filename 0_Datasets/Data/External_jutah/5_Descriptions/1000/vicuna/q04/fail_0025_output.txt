Yes, the road we are driving on is an intersection.

The image shows a busy city street with tall buildings on either side of the road. The road appears to run horizontally across the image, as there are no visible crosswalks or intersections in the scene. Cars and trucks are parked on the side of the road, and there are several pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The buildings in the background have large windows and appear to be commercial or office spaces.
