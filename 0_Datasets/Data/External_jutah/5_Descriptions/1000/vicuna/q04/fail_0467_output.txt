Yes, the road we are driving on is an intersection.

The image shows a busy city street with tall buildings on both sides of the road. The road appears to run horizontally across the image, as there are cars driving on it in both directions. There are also several parked cars on the side of the road, and a construction site with cranes and other equipment visible in the background.
