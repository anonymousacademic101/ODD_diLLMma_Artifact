Yes, the road we are driving on is narrow and winding.

The image shows a red excavator parked on the side of a road in front of a brick building. The road appears to be narrow and winding, with no visible lane markings or sidewalks. The building has large windows and a red awning over the entrance. There are several vehicles parked on the street, including a white van with a logo on the side. The image is taken from a high angle, looking down the street with a clear blue sky in the background.
