Yes, the road we are driving on is hilly.

The image shows a city street with a large church in the background. The church has a tall steeple and large stained glass windows. The street is lined with trees on both sides and there is a stop sign at the intersection. The road appears to be hilly, with a slight incline upwards in the distance.
