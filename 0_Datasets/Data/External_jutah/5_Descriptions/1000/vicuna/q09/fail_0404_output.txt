Yes, the road we are driving on is hilly.

The image shows a view of a city street with tall buildings on either side and palm trees lining the sidewalk. There are several cars parked on the side of the road and a bus driving down the street. The road appears to be hilly, with some inclines and declines visible in the distance.
