Yes, the road we are driving on is hilly.

The road is hilly because it is built on a slope. The slope is created by the natural topography of the area where the road is located. The road follows the contours of the landscape, going up and down as it winds its way through the trees and along the side of the hill. The slope is not steep, but it is enough to make the road hilly.
