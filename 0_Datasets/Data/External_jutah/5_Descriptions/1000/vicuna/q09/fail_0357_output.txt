Yes, the road we are driving on is hilly.

The image shows a city street with tall red brick buildings on either side of the road. The road appears to be sloping downward, indicating that it is hilly. There are no cars or pedestrians visible in the image, so it is difficult to determine whether the road is busy or not. However, based on the appearance of the buildings and the lack of activity on the street, it is likely that the road is not very busy.
