Yes, the road we are driving on is a sharp curve.

The image shows a city street with tall buildings on either side and a car parked on the side of the road. The road appears to be a sharp curve, as it goes around the side of one of the buildings. The buildings are made of gray brick and have large windows. There are trees and shrubs growing on the side of the road, and there is a sidewalk for pedestrians to walk on. The sky is clear and blue.
