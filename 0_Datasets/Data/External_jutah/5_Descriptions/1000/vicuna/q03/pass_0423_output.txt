Yes, the road in the image appears to be an on-ramp. The vehicles are traveling in the same direction as the flow of traffic on the main road, which suggests that they are merging onto the main road from a side street or off-ramp. The tall buildings on either side of the road also suggest that this is an urban area with high-rise buildings.
