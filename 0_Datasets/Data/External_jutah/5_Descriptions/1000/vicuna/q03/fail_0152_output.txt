Yes, the road in the image appears to be an on-off ramp.

The image shows a city street with multiple lanes and a median divider in the middle. On the left side of the image, there is a large building with many windows, and on the right side, there is a road that appears to be an on-off ramp. Cars and trucks are driving on the road, and there is a guardrail separating the on-ramp from the other lanes of traffic.

Based on this information, it is reasonable to conclude that the road in the image is an on-off ramp.
