Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The on-off ramp is a type of interchange that allows vehicles to enter or exit a controlled-access highway, such as a freeway or motorway. On-off ramps are typically used to connect local roads to controlled-access highways, allowing drivers to enter or exit the highway without having to travel through the entire length of the highway.

On-off ramps typically have two lanes: one for traffic entering the highway, and one for traffic exiting the highway. The lanes are separated by a barrier, such as a guardrail or a concrete median, to prevent vehicles from crossing over into oncoming traffic.

On-off ramps are an important feature of controlled-access highway systems, as they allow drivers to easily access and exit the highway, reducing congestion and improving traffic flow.
