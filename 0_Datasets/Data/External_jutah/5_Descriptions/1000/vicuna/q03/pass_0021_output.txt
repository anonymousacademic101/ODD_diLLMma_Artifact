Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a city street with buildings on either side and a bus driving down the middle of the road. The road appears to be an on-off ramp, as there are no other vehicles on the road and the bus is driving in the opposite direction of the traffic flow. The buildings on either side of the road are tall and appear to be commercial or industrial in nature.
