Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The on-off ramp is a road that allows vehicles to enter or exit a highway or freeway. It is typically located at the end of a highway or freeway, where it intersects with a local road or street. On-off ramps are designed to provide a smooth and safe transition for vehicles between the highway or freeway and the local road or street.

On-off ramps are important for traffic flow and safety. They help to reduce congestion on the highway or freeway by allowing vehicles to enter and exit at specific locations, rather than weaving in and out of traffic. They also help to reduce the risk of accidents by providing a designated area for vehicles to slow down and make their way onto or off of the highway or freeway.

Overall, on-off ramps are an important feature of modern road systems, helping to improve traffic flow and safety for drivers and pedestrians alike.
