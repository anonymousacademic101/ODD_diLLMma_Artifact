YES, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The on-off ramp is a type of road that allows vehicles to enter or exit a controlled-access highway, such as a freeway or expressway. On-off ramps are typically located at interchanges, where two or more highways meet. They are designed to allow vehicles to smoothly transition from one highway to another, without having to stop at a traffic light or intersection.

On-off ramps are an important feature of controlled-access highways, as they help to maintain the flow of traffic and reduce congestion on the road. They also help to ensure the safety of drivers and other road users by allowing vehicles to enter and exit the highway in a controlled and orderly manner.

Overall, on-off ramps are an essential part of modern transportation systems, as they help to facilitate the efficient and safe movement of vehicles on the road.
