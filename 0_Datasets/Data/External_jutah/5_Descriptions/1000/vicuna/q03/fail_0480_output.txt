Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a view of a road at night with cars driving on it. The road appears to be an on-off ramp, as there is a divider in the middle of the road and cars are driving on it in both directions. The road also has streetlights on either side, which are illuminating the area. The buildings on either side of the road appear to be tall and modern, with large windows and a glass facade. There are also trees on either side of the road, which are lit up by the streetlights.
