Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a city street with tall buildings on either side and a car driving down the middle of the road. The road appears to be an on-off ramp, as there are no other cars visible in the image and the car is driving in the opposite direction of the flow of traffic. Additionally, there are no visible intersections or crosswalks in the image, which suggests that the road is an on-off ramp.
