YES, the road in the image appears to be an on-ramp.

The image shows a busy city street with multiple lanes of traffic, including cars, buses, and trucks, traveling in both directions. The road appears to be an on-ramp, as it merges with another road and vehicles are entering and exiting the highway. The tall buildings on either side of the road suggest that it is a city street, and the traffic lights and signs indicate that it is a controlled intersection.
