Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The on-off ramp is a type of road that allows vehicles to enter or exit a controlled-access highway, such as a freeway or expressway. On-off ramps are typically located at interchanges, where two or more highways meet. They are designed to allow traffic to flow smoothly and safely between the different highways.

On-off ramps typically have two lanes: one for vehicles entering the highway, and one for vehicles exiting the highway. They may also have additional lanes for turning or merging traffic. The on-off ramp is designed to allow vehicles to enter or exit the highway at a controlled speed, reducing the risk of accidents or collisions.

Overall, on-off ramps are an important feature of controlled-access highways, helping to ensure the safe and efficient flow of traffic.
