Yes, the road in the image appears to be an on-off ramp.

The image shows a city street with a row of tall buildings on the left side and a row of shorter buildings on the right side. The road appears to be a continuation of the street that runs parallel to the image on the left side, and it seems to be an on-off ramp, as there is a solid white line on the left side of the road, indicating that it is a one-way street, and there is a dashed white line on the right side of the road, indicating that it is an on-off ramp. Additionally, there is a sign on the right side of the road that says "ON RAMP" which further confirms that it is an on-off ramp.
