Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The on-off ramp is a type of road that allows vehicles to enter or exit a controlled-access highway, such as a freeway or motorway. On-off ramps are typically located at interchanges, which are places where two or more highways meet. They are designed to allow vehicles to smoothly transition from one highway to another, or from the highway to the adjacent road or parking lot.

On-off ramps are important for the safe and efficient flow of traffic on controlled-access highways. They help to reduce congestion and delays by allowing vehicles to enter and exit the highway smoothly and quickly, without having to merge with traffic on the main lanes. On-off ramps also help to reduce the risk of accidents by providing a separate space for vehicles to enter and exit the highway, rather than having to do so in the midst of fast-moving traffic.

Overall, on-off ramps are a key feature of controlled-access highways and play an important role in the safe and efficient movement of traffic on these types of roads.
