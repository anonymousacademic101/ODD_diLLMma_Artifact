NO, the image does not have poor visibility. The sky is clear and there are no clouds in the sky. The buildings on either side of the street are tall and appear to be made of brick. There are several cars parked on the side of the road, but they are not obstructing the view of the street. Overall, the image appears to be a clear view of a city street on a sunny day.</s>
