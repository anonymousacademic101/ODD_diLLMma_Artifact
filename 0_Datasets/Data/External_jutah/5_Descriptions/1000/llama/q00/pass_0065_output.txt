NO, the image does not have poor visibility. The sky is clear and there are no clouds or other obstructions in the way. The street is empty and there are no cars or other vehicles parked on it. The buildings on either side of the street are tall and well-maintained, and there are palm trees lining the sidewalk. Overall, the image appears to be a clear and sunny day in a bustling city.</s>
