The image shows a street with palm trees on either side of the road. There are several cars parked on the side of the road, and a few pedestrians can be seen walking on the sidewalk. The sky is clear and sunny, with a few clouds visible in the distance. There is no evidence of poor visibility in the image, such as heavy rain, snow, fog, or adverse weather conditions. Therefore, the answer is NO.</s>
