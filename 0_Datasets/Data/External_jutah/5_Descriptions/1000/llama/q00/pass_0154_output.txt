The image shows a city street with tall buildings on either side. There are cars driving on the road and pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The sky is clear and sunny.

I would say that the visibility in this image is good. There are no signs of heavy rain, snow, fog, or adverse weather conditions. The sky is clear and sunny, which means that the visibility is good.</s>
