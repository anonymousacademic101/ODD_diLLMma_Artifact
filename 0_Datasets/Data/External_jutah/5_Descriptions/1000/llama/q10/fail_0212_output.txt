This image shows a street scene with a building on the left side of the road. The building appears to be a two story brick structure with a flat roof and a small parking lot in front. There is a fire hydrant on the left side of the road, and a stop sign on the right side. There are no pedestrians or vehicles visible in the image. The sky is cloudy and there is no sunlight visible. The time of day is difficult to determine from the image, but it appears to be early morning or late afternoon based on the shadows.</s>
