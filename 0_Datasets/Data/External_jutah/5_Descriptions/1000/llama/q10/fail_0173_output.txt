The image shows a city street with tall buildings on either side of the road. The buildings are made of brick and have large windows on the upper floors. There are several cars parked on the side of the road, and a few pedestrians are walking down the sidewalk. The sky is cloudy and there is rain falling from the sky. The road is wet and there are puddles of water on the ground. The time of day appears to be early evening, as the sun is setting behind the buildings. There are no traffic lights at the intersection, but there are stop signs on both sides of the road.</s>
