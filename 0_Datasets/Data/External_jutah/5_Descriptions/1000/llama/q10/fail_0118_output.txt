This is an image of a city street with tall buildings on either side. There are cars parked on the side of the road and pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The street is lined with streetlights and there is a large theater in the background. The time of day appears to be late afternoon or early evening based on the shadows on the buildings and the position of the sun in the sky.</s>
