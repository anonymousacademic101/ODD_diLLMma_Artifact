This image shows a street with a large puddle of water in the middle of the road. There are no cars or pedestrians visible in the image, and the sky is overcast with dark clouds. The road is lined with tall trees on either side, and there is a stop sign at the end of the street. The time of day appears to be late afternoon or early evening, based on the shadows cast by the trees and the position of the sun in the sky.</s>
