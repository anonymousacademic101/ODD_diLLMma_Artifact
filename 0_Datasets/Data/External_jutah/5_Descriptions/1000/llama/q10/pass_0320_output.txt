This image shows a long, dark tunnel with cars driving through it. The tunnel is made of concrete and has a low ceiling. There are no streetlights inside the tunnel, so it is very dark. Cars are driving through the tunnel in both directions. There are no pedestrians or other vehicles visible in the image. The time of day is unknown, but it appears to be during the day based on the shadows on the cars.</s>
