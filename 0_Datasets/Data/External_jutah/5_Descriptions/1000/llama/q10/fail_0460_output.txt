The image shows a city street at night with tall buildings on either side of the road. The buildings are made of glass and steel, with large windows and balconies on the upper floors. There are several cars parked along the side of the road, and a few pedestrians can be seen walking on the sidewalk. The sky is dark and cloudy, with a few stars visible in the sky. The time of day appears to be around 9 or 10 pm, based on the position of the sun and the shadows on the buildings. There are no road signs or traffic lights visible in the image.</s>
