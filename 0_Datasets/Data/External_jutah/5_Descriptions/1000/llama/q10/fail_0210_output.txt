This image shows a street scene with several buildings on either side of the road. The buildings are made of brick and have large windows on the upper floors. The road is paved with asphalt and has a few parked cars on it. There are no pedestrians or other vehicles visible in the image. The sky is cloudy and there are no trees or other vegetation visible. The time of day is difficult to determine from the image, but it appears to be during the day based on the shadows cast by the buildings.</s>
