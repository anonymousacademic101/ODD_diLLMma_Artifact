This image shows a street scene in a small town. The road is lined with buildings on both sides, including a few shops and restaurants. There are no cars parked on the street, but there are a few parked on the side of the road. The sky is clear and blue, with no clouds in sight. The time of day is difficult to determine, but it appears to be during the day based on the shadows on the buildings. There are no pedestrians visible in the image.</s>
