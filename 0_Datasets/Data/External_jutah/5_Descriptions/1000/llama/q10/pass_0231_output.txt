This is an image of a city street with a bridge over it. The bridge is made of steel girders and has a rusted appearance. The street is lined with buildings on both sides, some of which have windows and doors open. There are no cars or pedestrians visible in the image. The sky is blue and there are some clouds in it. The time of day appears to be early morning or late afternoon, as the shadows are long and the sun is low in the sky.</s>
