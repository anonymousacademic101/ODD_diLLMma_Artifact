This image shows a street scene with several buildings on either side of the road. The buildings are made of brick and have large windows and balconies. There are several cars parked along the side of the road, and a few pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk. The sky is clear and blue, and there are no trees or other vegetation visible in the image. The time of day is difficult to determine, but it appears to be during the day based on the shadows cast by the buildings. There are no road signs or traffic cones visible in the image, and the road appears to be in good condition.</s>
