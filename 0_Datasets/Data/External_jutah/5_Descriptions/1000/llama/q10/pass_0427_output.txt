The image shows a street in Miami, Florida, with a few cars parked on the side of the road. The buildings on either side of the street are tall and white, with large windows and balconies on the upper floors. There are palm trees lining the sidewalk, and a few pedestrians can be seen walking down the street. The sky is clear and blue, with a few clouds visible in the distance. The time of day is likely early morning or late afternoon, as there are few cars on the road and the sun is not directly overhead.</s>
