This image shows a rainy day in an urban area. The road is empty and there are no cars or pedestrians in sight. The buildings on either side of the road are made of brick and have large windows. There is a fire hydrant on the left side of the road and a stop sign on the right side. The sky is overcast and there are dark clouds in the distance. The time of day is difficult to determine, but it appears to be early in the morning or late in the afternoon.</s>
