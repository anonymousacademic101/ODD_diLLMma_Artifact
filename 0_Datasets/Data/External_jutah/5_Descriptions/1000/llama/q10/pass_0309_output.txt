The image shows a busy street with tall buildings on either side. There are several cars and buses driving down the street, and pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk. The time of day appears to be during the day, as the sun is shining and there are people walking around. The road structure is made up of two lanes of traffic in each direction, with a dividing line in the middle. There are traffic signs and signals at intersections, and pedestrian crossings are marked with white lines on the road. The buildings on either side of the street are tall and made of glass and steel, with large digital billboards on the sides of some of them.</s>
