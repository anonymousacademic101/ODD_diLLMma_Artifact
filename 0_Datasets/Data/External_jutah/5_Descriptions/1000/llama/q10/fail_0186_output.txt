This image shows a city street with several cars parked on the side of the road. The sky is overcast and there is rain falling from the clouds. The buildings on either side of the street are tall and modern, with large windows and glass facades. There are several pedestrians walking on the sidewalk, some of whom are carrying umbrellas to protect themselves from the rain. There are also several traffic lights at intersections along the street. The time of day appears to be late morning or early afternoon, based on the shadows cast by the buildings and the position of the sun in the sky.</s>
