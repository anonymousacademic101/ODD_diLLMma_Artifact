This image shows a street scene with a building on the left side of the road and a traffic light at the intersection. The building appears to be a large, brick structure with several windows and a flat roof. There are no cars or pedestrians visible in the image. The sky is cloudy and there is rain on the ground. The time of day is difficult to determine, but it appears to be early in the morning or late in the evening based on the shadows and lighting.</s>
