The image shows a large, modern hotel building with a glass facade and a large sign that reads "Four Points by Sheraton". The building is located on a busy street with a lot of traffic, including cars, buses, and pedestrians. There are streetlights on both sides of the road, and the building is well lit at night. The time of day appears to be around 9 or 10 pm, based on the shadows on the ground and the lighting of the building. The weather appears to be clear, with no clouds in the sky.</s>
