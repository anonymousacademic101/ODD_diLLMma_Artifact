This image shows a city street with tall buildings on either side of the road. There are several cars parked on the side of the road, and a few pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk. The sky is overcast and there is a light fog in the air. The time of day is unclear, but it appears to be early in the morning or late in the evening based on the shadows on the buildings and the lack of sunlight in the sky. There are no traffic lights at the intersection, but there are stop signs on both sides of the road.</s>
