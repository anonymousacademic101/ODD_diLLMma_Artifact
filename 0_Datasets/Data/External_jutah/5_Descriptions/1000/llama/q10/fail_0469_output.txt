This is an image of a city street at night. The building on the left side of the street is tall and has many windows. There are several cars parked on the street, and there are pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. There are also streetlights on both sides of the street. The time of day appears to be around 9 or 10 pm, as there are no cars on the street and the streetlights are on.</s>
