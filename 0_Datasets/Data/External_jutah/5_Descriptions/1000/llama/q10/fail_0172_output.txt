This is an image of a city street with a large brick building on the left side of the road. The building appears to be an old, abandoned warehouse with broken windows and a crumbling facade. The street is empty and there are no cars or pedestrians in sight. The sky is overcast and there are puddles of water on the road. The time of day appears to be early morning or late afternoon.</s>
