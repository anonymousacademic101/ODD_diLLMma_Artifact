This image shows a highway bridge overpass with several lanes of traffic driving underneath. The bridge is made of concrete and steel beams, and there are guardrails on either side to prevent vehicles from falling off. There are also traffic signs and signals at the intersection of the bridge and the road below. The sky is clear and blue, and there are trees and grass on either side of the road. The time of day is likely early morning or late afternoon, as there are few cars on the road and the sun is at a low angle in the sky.</s>
