The image shows a busy street in a city at night. There are tall buildings on either side of the road, with neon signs and lights illuminating them. The road is filled with cars, buses, and pedestrians, and there are traffic lights at the intersections. The sky is dark and clear, with a few stars visible in the distance. The time of day appears to be around 9 or 10 pm, based on the position of the sun and the shadows on the buildings.</s>
