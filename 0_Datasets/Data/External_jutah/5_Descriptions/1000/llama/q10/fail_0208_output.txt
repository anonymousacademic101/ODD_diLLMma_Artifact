This image shows a street with a few buildings on either side. The road is empty and there are no cars or pedestrians in sight. The sky is overcast and there are some clouds in the distance. The time of day appears to be early morning or late afternoon, as the sun is not directly overhead. There are no traffic lights or signs on the street, but there is a stop sign at the intersection in the distance. The sidewalk is cracked and there are some puddles of water on the ground. The buildings on either side of the street appear to be old and run down, with peeling paint and broken windows.</s>
