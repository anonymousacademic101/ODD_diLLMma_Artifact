The image shows a street scene with a train passing by on the tracks. The train is a red and white subway car with the words "Toronto Transit Commission" written on the side. The train is traveling in the opposite direction of the traffic on the road. There are several cars parked on the side of the road, and a few pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk. The sky is clear and there are no clouds in sight. The time of day appears to be late morning or early afternoon, as the sun is shining brightly in the sky. The buildings in the background are tall and modern, with large windows and balconies. There are no trees or other vegetation visible in the image.</s>
