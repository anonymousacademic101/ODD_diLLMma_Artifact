This image shows a street with a semi-truck driving down it. The road is made of asphalt and has a few trees on either side. There are no other vehicles on the road, and there are no pedestrians in sight. The sky is cloudy and the time of day appears to be late morning or early afternoon. There are no streetlights on the road, but there are power lines running along the side of the road. The overall mood of the image is one of emptiness and desolation.</s>
