This is an image of a city street at night. The road is empty and there are no cars or pedestrians in sight. The buildings on either side of the street are tall and made of brick and glass. There are streetlights on either side of the road, casting a warm glow over the area. The sky is dark and cloudy, with a few stars visible in the distance. The time of day is unknown, but it appears to be late at night based on the darkness of the sky and the lack of activity on the street.</s>
