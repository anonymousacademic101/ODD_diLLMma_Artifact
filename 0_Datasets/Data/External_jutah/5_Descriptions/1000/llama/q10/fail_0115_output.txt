The image shows a city street with tall buildings on either side of the road. The buildings are made of glass and steel, with large windows and balconies on the upper floors. The road is empty, with no cars or pedestrians in sight. The sky is clear and blue, with a few clouds scattered across it. The time of day is difficult to determine, but it appears to be early morning or late afternoon based on the shadows cast by the buildings. There are no road signs or traffic lights visible in the image.</s>
