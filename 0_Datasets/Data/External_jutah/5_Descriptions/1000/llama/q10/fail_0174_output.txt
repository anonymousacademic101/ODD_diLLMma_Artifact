The image shows a street scene in a city with a large building on the left side of the road. The building appears to be a restaurant or bar, with a sign reading "Thompson's" on the front. There are several cars parked along the curb, and pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk. The sky is cloudy and there is rain falling from the sky. The time of day appears to be early evening, as the sun is setting behind the buildings. The road is paved with asphalt and has a few potholes and cracks. There are no traffic lights or pedestrian crossings visible in the image.</s>
