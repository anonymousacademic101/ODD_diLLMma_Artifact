The image shows a busy street in Las Vegas at night. The road is lined with tall buildings on both sides, including casinos, hotels, and shops. There are several cars and buses driving on the road, and pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk. The sky is clear and the moon is visible in the background. The time of day appears to be around 9 or 10 pm, based on the position of the sun and the shadows on the buildings.</s>
