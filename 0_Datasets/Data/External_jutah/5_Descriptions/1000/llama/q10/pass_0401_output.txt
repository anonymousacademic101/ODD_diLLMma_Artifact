The image shows a city street with tall buildings on either side. The road is lined with trees and there are parked cars on both sides. There are pedestrians walking on the sidewalk and a few bicycles parked on the side of the road. The sky is clear and the sun is setting in the background, casting a warm orange glow over the scene. The time of day appears to be late afternoon or early evening based on the shadows cast by the buildings and the position of the sun in the sky.</s>
