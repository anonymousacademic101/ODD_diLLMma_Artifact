This image shows a street scene at night. There are several cars parked on the side of the road, and a few pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The road is made of asphalt and has a few potholes and cracks. There are streetlights on both sides of the road, casting a warm glow over the scene. The buildings on either side of the road are tall and made of brick, with large windows and doors. The time of day appears to be around 9 or 10 pm, as there are few cars on the road and the streetlights are on.</s>
