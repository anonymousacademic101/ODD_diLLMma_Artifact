This image shows a street with a small house on one side and a vacant lot on the other. The house has a red brick facade and a small porch with steps leading up to the front door. The lot is empty and has a few trees growing in it. There is no traffic on the street and no pedestrians in sight. The sky is cloudy and there is a small puddle of water on the road. The time of day is difficult to determine, but it appears to be early in the morning or late in the afternoon.</s>
