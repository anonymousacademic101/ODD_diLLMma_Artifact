This is an image of a street with a few cars parked on the side of the road. There are no pedestrians in sight, and the sky is overcast with dark clouds. The road is wet and there are puddles of water on it. The traffic lights at the intersection are green, indicating that it is safe to drive. The time of day is difficult to determine, but it appears to be early in the morning or late in the evening based on the shadows cast by the trees and buildings.</s>
