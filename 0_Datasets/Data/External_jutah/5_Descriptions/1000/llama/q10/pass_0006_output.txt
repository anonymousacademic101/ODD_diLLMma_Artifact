This image shows a street scene with a traffic light at the intersection of two roads. The road on the left is lined with trees and buildings, while the road on the right is empty. There are no cars or pedestrians visible in the image. The sky is cloudy and there is no sunlight visible. The time of day is difficult to determine, but it appears to be early morning or late afternoon based on the shadows on the buildings.</s>
