There are traffic lights at the intersection and pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The sky is overcast and there are dark clouds in the distance. The buildings on either side of the road are brick and appear to be old. There are no trees or other vegetation visible in the image. The time of day is difficult to determine, but it appears to be early in the morning or late in the evening based on the lighting.</s>
