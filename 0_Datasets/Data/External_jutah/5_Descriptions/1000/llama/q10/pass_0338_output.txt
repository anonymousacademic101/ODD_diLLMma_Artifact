The image shows a street with several parked cars on the side of the road. The buildings on either side of the street are tall and made of brick, with large windows and balconies. The sky is clear and sunny, with a few clouds scattered in the distance. There are no pedestrians or other vehicles visible in the image. The time of day appears to be late morning or early afternoon, based on the shadows cast by the buildings and the position of the sun in the sky.</s>
