The image shows a street scene with a large brick building on the left and a smaller building on the right. There are several cars parked along the side of the road, and a pedestrian is walking down the sidewalk. The building on the left has a sign that reads "Farmers'Market" in large letters, while the building on the right has a sign that reads "Farmers'Market" in smaller letters. There are also several baskets of vegetables hanging from the balcony of the building on the left. The time of day is likely early morning or late afternoon, as there are few cars on the road and the sun is not directly overhead.</s>
