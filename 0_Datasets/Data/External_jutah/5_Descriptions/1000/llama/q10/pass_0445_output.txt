The image shows a city street with tall buildings on either side of the road. There are several cars driving down the street, and pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk. The sky is clear and the sun is setting in the background, casting a warm orange glow over the scene. The road is lined with palm trees and there are streetlights on either side of the road. The time of day appears to be in the late afternoon or early evening, based on the shadows cast by the buildings and the position of the sun in the sky.</s>
