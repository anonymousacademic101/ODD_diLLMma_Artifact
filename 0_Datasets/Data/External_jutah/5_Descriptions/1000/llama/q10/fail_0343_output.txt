This image shows a street scene with tall buildings on either side of the road. The buildings are made of brick and have large windows on the upper floors. There are several cars parked on the side of the road, and a few pedestrians are walking down the sidewalk. The sky is clear and blue, with a few white clouds scattered across it. The time of day appears to be late morning or early afternoon, based on the shadows cast by the buildings and the position of the sun. There are no traffic lights or signs visible in the image.</s>
