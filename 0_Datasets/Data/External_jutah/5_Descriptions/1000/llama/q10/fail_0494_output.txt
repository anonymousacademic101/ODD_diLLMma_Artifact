The image shows a busy street in a city at night. The road is lined with tall buildings on both sides, and there are many cars and pedestrians on the street. The time of day appears to be around 9 or 10 pm, as there are few cars on the road and most of the buildings are lit up. The road signs and traffic lights are visible, and there are pedestrians crossing the street at intersections. The image is taken from a high vantage point, possibly from a building or a bridge, and there is a clear view of the city skyline in the background.</s>
