This image shows a city street with a few cars parked on the side of the road. The sky is cloudy and there is rain falling from the sky. The buildings on either side of the street are tall and made of glass and steel. There are pedestrians walking on the sidewalk and crossing the street at intersections. The time of day is unclear, but it appears to be early in the morning or late in the evening based on the shadows on the buildings and the lack of sunlight in the sky.</s>
