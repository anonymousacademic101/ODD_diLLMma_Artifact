This image shows a street with a few cars parked on the side of the road. The street is empty and there are no pedestrians in sight. The sky is overcast and there is a light drizzle of rain. The buildings on either side of the street are tall and modern, with large windows and glass facades. There is a construction site on the left side of the street, with scaffolding and dumpsters visible. The time of day is unclear, but it appears to be early morning or late afternoon based on the shadows cast by the buildings.</s>
