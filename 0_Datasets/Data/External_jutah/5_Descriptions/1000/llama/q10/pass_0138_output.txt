This image shows a city street with tall skyscrapers on either side. The road is empty and there are no cars or pedestrians in sight. The sky is clear and blue, with a few clouds scattered across it. The time of day is difficult to determine, but it appears to be early in the morning or late in the evening based on the shadows cast by the buildings. There are no road signs or traffic lights visible in the image.</s>
