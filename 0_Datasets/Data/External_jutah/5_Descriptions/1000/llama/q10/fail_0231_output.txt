This image shows a street with a few buildings on either side. The buildings are made of brick and have windows on the upper floors. There is a power line running down the middle of the street, and there are a few cars parked on the side of the road. The sky is overcast, and there is a small puddle of water on the ground. There are no pedestrians or other vehicles visible in the image. The time of day is difficult to determine, but it appears to be early in the morning or late in the afternoon.</s>
