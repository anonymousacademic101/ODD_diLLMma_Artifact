This image shows a street scene with several buildings on either side of the road. The buildings are made of brick and have windows on the upper floors. There are several cars parked along the side of the road, and people are walking on the sidewalk. In the distance, there is a tall building with a clock tower on top. The sky is blue and there are some clouds in the background. The time of day is likely early morning or late afternoon, as there are not many cars on the road and the sun is not directly overhead.</s>
