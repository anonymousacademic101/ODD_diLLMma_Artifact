This image shows a street scene in a city with tall buildings on either side of the road. The road is lined with parked cars and there are pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The time of day appears to be late morning or early afternoon, as the sun is shining and there are shadows on the buildings. There are no traffic lights at the intersection, but there are stop signs on both sides of the road. The buildings appear to be made of brick and have large windows on the upper floors. There is a fire hydrant on the corner of the intersection and a trash can on the sidewalk.</s>
