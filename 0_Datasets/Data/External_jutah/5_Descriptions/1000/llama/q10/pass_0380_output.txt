The image shows a city street at night with tall buildings on either side. The road is empty and there are no cars or pedestrians in sight. There are streetlights on both sides of the road, casting a warm glow over the scene. The sky is clear and there are no clouds in sight. The time of day appears to be around 9 or 10 pm, judging by the shadows on the buildings and the streetlights.</s>
