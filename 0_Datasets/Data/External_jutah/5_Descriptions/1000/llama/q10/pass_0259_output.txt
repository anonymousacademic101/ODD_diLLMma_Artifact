The image shows a busy street in a city at night. The road is lined with tall buildings on both sides, some of which have neon lights and billboards advertising various products and services. There are several cars and buses driving on the road, as well as pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The sky is dark and there are a few stars visible in the distance. The time of day appears to be around 9 or 10 pm, based on the position of the sun and the shadows on the buildings. There are no other vehicles or pedestrians visible in the image.</s>
