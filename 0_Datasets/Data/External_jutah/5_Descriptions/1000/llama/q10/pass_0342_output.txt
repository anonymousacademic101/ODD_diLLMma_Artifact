This is an image of a city street with tall buildings on either side. The road is divided into two lanes, one for traffic going in each direction. There are traffic lights at the intersection, and pedestrians are crossing the street. The time of day is likely early morning or late afternoon, as there are few cars on the road. The buildings are made of glass and steel, and they appear to be quite tall. There are also some parked cars on the side of the road.</s>
