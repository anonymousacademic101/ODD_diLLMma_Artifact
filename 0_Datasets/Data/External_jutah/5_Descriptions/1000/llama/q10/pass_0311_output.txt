The image shows a busy street with tall buildings on either side. There are several cars and buses driving down the street, and pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk. The sky is clear and blue, and there are no clouds in sight. The time of day appears to be during the day, as the sun is shining brightly. The road structure consists of two lanes of traffic in each direction, with a dividing line in the middle. There are traffic signs and signals at intersections, and pedestrian crossings are marked with white lines. The buildings on either side of the street are tall and modern, with large windows and glass facades.</s>
