The image shows a city street with tall buildings on either side of the road. There are several cars parked on the side of the road, and pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk. The sky is clear and the sun is setting in the background, casting a warm orange glow over the scene. The time of day appears to be late afternoon or early evening, based on the shadows cast by the buildings and the position of the sun in the sky.</s>
