This image shows a city street with a large building on the left side of the road. The building appears to be under construction, with scaffolding and construction equipment visible on the roof. There are also several cars and trucks driving on the road, as well as pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The sky is a bright pink color, and the sun is shining down on the scene. The time of day appears to be late afternoon or early evening, based on the shadows cast by the buildings and the position of the sun in the sky.</s>
