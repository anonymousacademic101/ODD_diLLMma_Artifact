The image shows a street scene at night in a city. The building on the left side of the street is a tall, modern office building with large windows and a glass facade. The building on the right side of the street is a shorter, older building with a brick facade. There are several pedestrians walking on the sidewalk, and a few cars are parked on the street. The time of day appears to be around 8 or 9 pm, based on the position of the sun in the sky. There are streetlights on both sides of the street, casting a warm glow over the scene.</s>
