The image shows a street with a green traffic light at the intersection of two roads. The road on the left is lined with palm trees and has a few cars parked on it. There are pedestrians walking on the sidewalk, and a few bicycles are parked on the side of the road. The sky is clear and blue, with a few clouds visible in the distance. The time of day is likely early morning or late afternoon, as there are few cars on the road and the sun is at a low angle in the sky.</s>
