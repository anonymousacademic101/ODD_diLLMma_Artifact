This image shows a street scene with a large building on the left side of the road. The building appears to be a warehouse or factory, with a large loading dock in front of it. There are several cars parked on the street in front of the building, and a few pedestrians can be seen walking down the sidewalk. The sky is cloudy and there is a light drizzle of rain. The time of day appears to be late afternoon or early evening, based on the shadows on the ground and the position of the sun in the sky.</s>
