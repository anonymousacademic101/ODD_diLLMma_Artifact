This image shows a street with several abandoned buildings on either side. The buildings appear to be in various stages of disrepair, with some having broken windows, crumbling walls, and overgrown vegetation. The road is empty and there are no cars or pedestrians in sight. The sky is overcast and there is a light drizzle of rain. The time of day appears to be late afternoon or early evening, based on the shadows cast by the buildings and the position of the sun.</s>
