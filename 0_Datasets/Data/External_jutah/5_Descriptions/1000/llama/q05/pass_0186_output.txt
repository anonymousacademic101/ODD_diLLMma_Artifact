Yes, the road we are driving on has restricted lanes for buses and bicycles. There are designated lanes for buses and bicycles on either side of the road, and cars are not allowed to park in these lanes. This is to ensure that buses and bicycles have enough space to travel safely and efficiently through the city.</s>
