Yes, the road we are driving on has restricted lanes for buses and bicycles. There are designated lanes for buses and bicycles on either side of the road, which are marked with signs and markings. These lanes are reserved for buses and bicycles only, and other vehicles are not allowed to use them. This is a common feature in many cities to encourage sustainable transportation and reduce traffic congestion.</s>
