Yes, the road we are driving on has restricted lanes for buses and bicycles. There are designated lanes for buses and bicycles on the left side of the road, and cars are not allowed to drive in these lanes. This is to ensure the safety of cyclists and bus riders, as they are more vulnerable to accidents than cars.</s>
