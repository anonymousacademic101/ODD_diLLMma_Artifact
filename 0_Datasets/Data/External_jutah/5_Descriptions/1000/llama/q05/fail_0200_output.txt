The image shows an old, abandoned building with overgrown vegetation growing out of the walls. The building appears to be in a state of disrepair, with broken windows and graffiti on the walls. There is a small puddle of water on the ground in front of the building.

As for your question, the road we are driving on does not have any restricted lanes for buses or bicycles.</s>
