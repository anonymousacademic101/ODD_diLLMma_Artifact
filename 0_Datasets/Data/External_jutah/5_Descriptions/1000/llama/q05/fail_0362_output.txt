The image shows a building with a large glass facade and a sign that reads "Image Content". The building appears to be under construction, with scaffolding and construction equipment visible on the sidewalk. There are no pedestrians or vehicles visible in the image.

As for your question, the road does not have any restricted lanes for buses or bicycles. It appears to be a typical city street with two lanes for cars and a sidewalk for pedestrians.</s>
