The road we are driving on does not have any restricted lanes, such as for buses or bicycles. It appears to be a regular street with two lanes of traffic, one for cars and the other for pedestrians. There are buildings on either side of the road, including shops and restaurants. The sky is cloudy and there are palm trees lining the sidewalk.</s>
