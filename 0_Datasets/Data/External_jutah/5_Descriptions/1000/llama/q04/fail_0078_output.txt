The road we are driving on is an intersection. The image shows a street with several buildings on either side, including a large brick building with a green awning over the entrance. There are also several cars parked on the side of the road, and pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The sky is clear and blue, with no clouds in sight.

The answer to your question is NO, the road does not run horizontally across the image. The image shows a street with buildings on either side, and the road runs perpendicular to the image.</s>
