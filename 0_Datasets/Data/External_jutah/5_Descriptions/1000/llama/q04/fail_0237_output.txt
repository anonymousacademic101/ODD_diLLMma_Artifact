The image shows a parking lot with several portable toilets lined up along the side of the road. The sky is cloudy and there are trees in the background.

Is the road we are driving on an intersection, or does it run horizontally across the image?

NO, the road does not run horizontally across the image. It appears to be a parking lot with several portable toilets lined up along the side of the road.</s>
