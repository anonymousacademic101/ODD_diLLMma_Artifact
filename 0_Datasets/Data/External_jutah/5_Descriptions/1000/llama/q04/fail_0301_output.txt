The road we are driving on is an intersection. The image shows a city street with tall buildings on either side, and a few cars parked on the side of the road. The buildings are made of concrete and glass, and have balconies and windows on the upper floors. The street is lined with trees and greenery, and there are pedestrians walking on the sidewalk.</s>
