The image shows a city street with a truck driving down it. The truck is parked on the side of the road, and there are pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The buildings on either side of the street are tall and made of glass and steel.

The answer to your question is NO, the road does not run horizontally across the image. The road runs along the left side of the image, and the truck is parked on the right side of the road.</s>
