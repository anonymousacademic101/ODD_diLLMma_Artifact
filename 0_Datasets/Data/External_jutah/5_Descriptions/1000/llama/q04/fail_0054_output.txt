The road we are driving on is an intersection. The image shows a white building with a red roof on the left side of the road, and a blue building with a white roof on the right side of the road. There is a traffic light at the intersection, and a truck is stopped at the light. The sky is cloudy and there are palm trees on either side of the road.

The reason why the road is an intersection is because there are two buildings on either side of the road, and a traffic light at the intersection.
