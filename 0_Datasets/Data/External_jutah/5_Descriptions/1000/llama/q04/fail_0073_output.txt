Yes, the road we are driving on is an intersection. The image shows a street with two lanes of traffic traveling in opposite directions, with parked cars on both sides of the road. The buildings on either side of the road are tall and white, with large windows and balconies on the upper floors. There are palm trees lining the sidewalk, and pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk.</s>
