The image shows a pink building with white shutters and a white pickup truck parked in front of it. There are palm trees on either side of the road, and a few cars are parked on the side of the road. The road appears to run horizontally across the image.

Is the road we are driving on an intersection, or does it run horizontally across the image?

NO, the road does not run horizontally across the image. It appears to be a residential street with a few cars parked on the side of the road.</s>
