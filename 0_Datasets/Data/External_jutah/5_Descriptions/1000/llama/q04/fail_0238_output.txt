The image shows a lighthouse on a small island in the middle of a body of water. The lighthouse has a red and white striped roof and a white tower with a green light on top. There is a small parking lot in front of the lighthouse, with several cars parked in it. The sky is cloudy and there are some trees in the background.

The road we are driving on is horizontal across the image, running from the left side of the image to the right.</s>
