The road we are driving on is an intersection. The image shows a white building with a red and white awning on the corner of the intersection. There are two cars parked on the side of the road, one on the left and one on the right. The sky is cloudy and there are palm trees on either side of the road.

The answer to your question is NO, the road does not run horizontally across the image.</s>
