The image shows a building with a large sign on the front that reads "Four Points by Sheraton". The building appears to be a hotel, as there are windows on the upper floors and a parking lot in front of it. The road in front of the building appears to be a city street, as there are cars parked along it and pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. Therefore, the answer is NO, the road does not run horizontally across the image.</s>
