Yes, the road we are driving on is an intersection. The image shows a city street with cars parked on both sides and pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The buildings on either side of the street are tall and appear to be made of brick or stone. The sky is dark and there are streetlights on the corners of the intersection.</s>
