The image shows a street with a building on the left side and a pedestrian crossing on the right side. The building appears to be an office building with large windows on the upper floors and a sign on the front that reads, "Chicago Theatre". The street is lined with trees and has a sidewalk on both sides. There are no cars or other vehicles visible in the image.

The answer to your question is NO, the road we are driving on is not an on-off ramp.</s>
