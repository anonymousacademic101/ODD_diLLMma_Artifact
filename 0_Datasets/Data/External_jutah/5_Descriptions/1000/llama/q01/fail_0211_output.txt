The image shows a building with a large parking lot in front of it. There are several cars parked on the lot, and the sidewalk is empty. The building appears to be a high-rise apartment complex with many windows on each floor. The sky is cloudy and there is no sunlight visible in the image.

The camera that took this image was not obstructed, covered, or damaged by mud, ice, snow, excessive paint or adhesive products. It appears to be a clear and unobstructed view of the building and parking lot.</s>
