Yes, the camera that took this image was obstructed by rain. The image shows a street with a house on one side and a vacant lot on the other. The house appears to be in disrepair, with peeling paint and broken windows. The street is empty and there are no cars or pedestrians in sight. The sky is overcast and there is a puddle of water on the road.</s>
