The image shows a street with a bridge in the background. There are cars parked on the side of the road and pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The sky is clear and there are trees on either side of the road.

The answer to your question is NO, the road is not hilly. The bridge in the background is the Brooklyn Bridge, which spans the East River and connects Brooklyn and Manhattan. The road is flat and straight, with no hills in sight.</s>
