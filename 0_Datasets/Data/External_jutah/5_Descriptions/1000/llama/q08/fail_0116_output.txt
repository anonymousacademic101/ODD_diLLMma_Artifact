Yes, the road we are driving on is narrow and winding. The image shows a view of a city street with tall buildings on either side of the road. There are cars driving on the road and pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The image is taken from underneath the bridge, looking up at the buildings and the cars driving on the road.</s>
