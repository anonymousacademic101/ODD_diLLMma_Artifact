Yes, the road is narrow and winding.

The image shows a city street with tall buildings on either side of the road. The buildings are made of glass and steel, and they appear to be quite modern. There are cars parked along the side of the road, and a few pedestrians can be seen walking on the sidewalk. The sky is a hazy orange color, and the sun is setting in the distance.</s>
