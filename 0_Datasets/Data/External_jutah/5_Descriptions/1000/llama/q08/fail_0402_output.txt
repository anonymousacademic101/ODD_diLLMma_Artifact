The image shows a street with a white van parked on the side of the road. There are buildings on either side of the street, and a few people are walking on the sidewalk. The sky is clear and blue, with some clouds in the distance.

The road is not narrow and winding. It appears to be a straight road with two lanes, one for each direction of traffic. There are no obstacles or hazards in the road, and the van is parked legally on the side of the road.</s>
