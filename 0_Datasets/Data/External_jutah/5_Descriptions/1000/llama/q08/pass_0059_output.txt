The image shows a street with palm trees on either side of the road. There are several cars parked on the side of the road, and a few pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The sky is clear and blue, with a few clouds visible in the distance.

The answer to your question is NO, the road is not narrow and winding. It appears to be a wide, straight road with plenty of space for cars to drive on.</s>
