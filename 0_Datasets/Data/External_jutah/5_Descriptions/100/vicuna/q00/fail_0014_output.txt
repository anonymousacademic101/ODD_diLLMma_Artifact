The image shows a busy city street with tall buildings on either side of the road. There are several cars parked on the side of the road and a few pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The sky appears to be cloudy, which could affect visibility. However, it is difficult to determine the level of visibility without more information about the weather conditions at the time the image was taken.
