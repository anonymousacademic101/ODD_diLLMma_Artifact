This image shows a city street on a rainy day. The street is lined with tall buildings on both sides, with several cars parked on the side of the road. There is a stop light at the intersection, and a crosswalk for pedestrians to cross the street. The road appears to be wet and slippery, with puddles of water on the ground. There are no visible road signs or markings in the image. The time of day is unclear, but it appears to be daytime based on the presence of streetlights and the lack of darkness.
