This is a photograph of a city street with tall buildings on either side. The street is empty of cars, but there are several pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The buildings are made of brick and have large windows on the upper floors. The street is straight and has a crosswalk in the middle. There are no traffic lights or signs visible in the photograph. The time of day is likely morning or afternoon, as the sun is shining brightly, but there are no shadows on the ground.
