This image shows a street view of a city street with palm trees lining both sides of the road. The buildings on either side of the street appear to be hotels or resorts, with large windows and balconies overlooking the street. There are no cars visible in the image, but there are several pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The time of day appears to be late afternoon, as the sun is setting in the background. There are no road signs or traffic signals visible in the image.
