This image shows a view of a busy city street with tall buildings on both sides. The road is asphalt and has two lanes, one for each direction of traffic. There is a yellow line down the middle of the road, separating the two lanes. There are several cars driving on the road, including a taxi and a truck. There are also several pedestrians on the sidewalk, some of whom are walking on their phones.

There are several road signs on the side of the road, including a stop sign, a yield sign, and a speed limit sign that says 30 mph. There are also several streetlights on the side of the road, which are turned on during the day.

It appears to be a sunny day, as there are no clouds in the sky and the sun is shining down on the buildings. There are several palm trees on the side of the road, which provide shade for the pedestrians.

It is difficult to determine the time of day from this image, as there are no clocks or other time-telling devices visible.
