The image shows a city street with a concrete bridge in the background. The road has two lanes, one for each direction of traffic. There is a traffic light on the right side of the road, with a green light shining down on the left lane and a red light shining down on the right lane. A white van is driving on the left lane, approaching the traffic light. There are no pedestrians or other vehicles visible in the image. The time of day appears to be dusk or dawn, as the sky is dimly lit, but there are no shadows visible in the image.
