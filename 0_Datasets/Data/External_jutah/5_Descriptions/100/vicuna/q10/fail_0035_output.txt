The image shows a busy city street with tall skyscrapers in the background. The road is divided into two lanes, one for traffic going straight and the other for traffic turning right. There is a traffic light at the intersection, showing a green light for traffic going straight and a red light for traffic turning right. There are no pedestrians visible in the image. The time of day appears to be daytime, as there are no lights on in the buildings and the sun is shining.
