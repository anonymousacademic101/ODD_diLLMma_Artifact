This image shows a busy city street at night. The road is divided into multiple lanes, with a median in the middle. The street is lined with tall buildings on both sides, some of which have glass facades. There are streetlights and traffic lights along the road, and a few pedestrians can be seen crossing the street. The time of day appears to be night, as the sky is dark and there are no visible sunlight or shadows.
