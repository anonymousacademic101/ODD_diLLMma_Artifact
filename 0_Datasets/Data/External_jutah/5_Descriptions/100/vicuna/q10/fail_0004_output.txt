The image shows a view of a city street with palm trees lining both sides of the road. The road has two lanes, one for traffic going in each direction. There is a traffic light at the intersection, with a green light for traffic going straight, a red light for traffic turning left, and a yellow light for traffic turning right. There are several cars parked on the side of the road, and a few pedestrians can be seen walking on the sidewalk. The sky is clear and blue, with fluffy white clouds. It appears to be a sunny day.
