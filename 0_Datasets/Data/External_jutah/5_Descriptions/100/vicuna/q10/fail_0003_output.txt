This is a view of a city street with a stoplight in the center of the intersection. On the left side of the road, there is a row of palm trees lining the sidewalk. There are several cars parked on the right side of the road, and a few more driving down the street. The buildings on the right side of the street are a mix of residential and commercial properties, with shops and restaurants visible from the street. The time of day appears to be daytime, as there are no lights on in the buildings and the sun is shining.
