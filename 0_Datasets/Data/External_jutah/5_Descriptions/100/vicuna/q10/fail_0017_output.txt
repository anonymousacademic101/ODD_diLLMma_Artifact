This is a photograph of a city street on a rainy day. The street is lined with tall buildings on both sides, with cars and buses driving on the road. There are also several pedestrians walking on the sidewalk, some holding umbrellas to protect themselves from the rain. The traffic lights are green, indicating that it is safe to drive through the intersection. The time of day is likely morning or afternoon, as the sun is not fully visible in the sky.
