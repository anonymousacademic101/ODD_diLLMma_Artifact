The image shows a busy street in Miami, Florida. The street is lined with tall white buildings on both sides, and there are palm trees growing along the sidewalk. There are several cars parked on the side of the road, and a few pedestrians can be seen walking on the sidewalk. There is a traffic light at the intersection, and a sign indicating the speed limit. The time of day appears to be during the day, as there are no lights on in the buildings and the sun is shining brightly.
