Yes, the road we are driving on is an intersection.

The image shows a city street with tall buildings on either side and a large fountain in the center of the intersection. The fountain appears to be made of stone and has several levels, with water flowing down from the top level to the lower levels. The street is empty of cars, but there are several parked cars on the side of the road. The buildings on either side of the street are tall and appear to be made of concrete and glass. There are several windows visible on each building, and some of them have blinds or curtains drawn. The sky appears to be cloudy, with dark clouds visible in the background.
