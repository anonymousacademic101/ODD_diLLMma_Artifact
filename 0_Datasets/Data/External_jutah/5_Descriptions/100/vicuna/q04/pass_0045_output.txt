YES, the road we are driving on is an intersection.

The image shows a busy city street at night with tall buildings on both sides of the road. The road appears to run horizontally across the image, as there are multiple lanes of traffic traveling in the same direction, and there are no visible intersections in the image. The street is lined with streetlights and there are cars, trucks, and buses traveling in both directions.
