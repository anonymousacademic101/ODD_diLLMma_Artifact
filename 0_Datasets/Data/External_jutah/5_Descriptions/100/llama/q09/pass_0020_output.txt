The image shows a dirt road running through a grassy field. There are several buildings in the background, including a large, abandoned building with broken windows and a crumbling facade. The sky is overcast with dark clouds, and there is a small puddle of water on the road.

The answer to your question is NO. The road is not hilly. It is a flat, dirt road running through a grassy field.</s>
