The road we are driving on is an intersection. The image shows a city street with buildings on either side of the road. There are cars parked on the side of the road and pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The sky is blue and there are trees in the background.

The answer to your question is NO, the road does not run horizontally across the image. It runs perpendicular to the image, from left to right.</s>
