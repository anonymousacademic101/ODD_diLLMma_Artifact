This image shows a city street with a traffic light at an intersection. The street is lined with tall buildings on either side, and there are parked cars on both sides of the road. There are pedestrians walking on the sidewalk, and a few bicycles are parked on the side of the road. The sky is overcast, and there is a small puddle of water on the road. The time of day appears to be late morning or early afternoon, based on the shadows on the buildings and the position of the sun.</s>
