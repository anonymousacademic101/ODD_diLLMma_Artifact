This image shows a city street with a bus driving down the road. The bus is a blue and white city bus with the words "City Transit" written on the side. There are several cars parked on the side of the road, and pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk. The buildings on either side of the street are tall and made of brick and glass. The sky is clear and blue, with a few clouds scattered in the distance. The time of day is likely early morning or late afternoon, as there are not many people on the street.</s>
