This is an image of a busy street in a city at night. The building on the left side of the street is tall and has many windows, while the building on the right side is shorter and has fewer windows. There are several cars parked along the street, and pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk. There are streetlights on both sides of the street, casting a warm glow over the area. The time of day appears to be around 9 or 10 pm, based on the position of the sun in the sky.</s>
