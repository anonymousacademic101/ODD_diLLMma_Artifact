This image shows a street with a bridge over it. The bridge is made of concrete and steel beams, and has a sign on it that says "Road Closed Ahead". There are cars parked on the side of the road, and pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The sky is cloudy and there are trees and buildings in the background. The time of day is likely early morning or late afternoon, as there are few cars on the road and the sun is low in the sky.</s>
