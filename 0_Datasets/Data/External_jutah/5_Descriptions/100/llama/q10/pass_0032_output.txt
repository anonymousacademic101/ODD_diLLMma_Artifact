This is an image of a city street with tall buildings on either side. There are several cars and buses driving down the street, and pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk. The time of day appears to be during the day, as the sun is shining and there are people out and about. The road structure consists of two lanes of traffic, one in each direction, with a dividing line in the middle. There are traffic signs and signals at intersections, and pedestrian crossings with signals for pedestrians to cross the street.</s>
