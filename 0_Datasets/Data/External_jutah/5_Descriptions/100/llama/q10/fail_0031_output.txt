This image shows a city street with tall buildings on either side. The buildings are made of brick and have large windows on the upper floors. There are streetlights on the corners of the street and a traffic light at the intersection. There are also pedestrians walking on the sidewalk and bicycles parked on the side of the road. The time of day appears to be early evening, as the sun is setting behind the buildings.</s>
