The sky is cloudy and there are palm trees visible in the background. The time of day appears to be late morning or early afternoon, based on the shadows on the buildings and the position of the sun. There are no traffic lights at the intersection, but there are stop signs on both sides of the road. The road surface appears to be in good condition, with no potholes or other damage. There are no other vehicles visible in the image, just the cars parked on the side of the road and the pedestrians walking on the sidewalk.</s>
