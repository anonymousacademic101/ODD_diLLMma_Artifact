In the image provided, the curb lane on the right side is marked by a sign with the text "RESERVED LANE," suggesting that this lane is reserved for specific types of vehicles and not for general traffic. However, from the image alone, it's not entirely clear which types of vehicles are permitted to use this lane, such as buses or bicycles, as there are no visible indicators specifying the type of restricted lane. The reservation could also be for other purposes such as valet parking or hotel guest loading associated with the establishment shown in the image.
