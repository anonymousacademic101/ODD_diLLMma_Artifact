In the image provided, although it is not very clear, there appears to be a sign on the right side of the road beneath the traffic lights with a symbol that may indicate a restricted lane, possibly for buses or bicycles. Such signs are typically used to denote lanes designated for specific types of vehicles, and the placement of the sign suggests it is related to the lane closest to it.
