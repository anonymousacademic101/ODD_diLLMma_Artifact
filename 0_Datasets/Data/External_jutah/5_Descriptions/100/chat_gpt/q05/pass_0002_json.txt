The lane is painted pink with white designs, which suggests it may be reserved for particular users, such as buses or bicycles. This type of coloring and pattern is often used to distinguish lanes for specific purposes and to alert regular traffic that the lane has restrictions. However, without explicit signage visible in the image, it's not possible to determine the exact type of restriction or for whom it is reserved."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
