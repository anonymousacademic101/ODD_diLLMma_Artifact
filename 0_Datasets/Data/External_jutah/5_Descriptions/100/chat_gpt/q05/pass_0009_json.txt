This kind of lane marking typically indicates a lane that is restricted for use by certain types of vehicles, such as buses or carpools (High-Occupancy Vehicle lanes, or HOV lanes). It is common on many multi-lane roads or highways to have such lanes to promote carpooling or provide priority for public transportation. The specific rules and vehicle types permitted to use this lane would be governed by local traffic laws and indicated by additional signage or road markings not fully visible in the image. However, given the context and the standard use of yellow lines in many regions, it can be inferred that there is a likelihood of a restricted lane present.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
