Based on the image provided, we are unable to determine if there are any restricted lanes such as those specifically for buses or bicycles. The view does not include road surface markings or signs that would indicate the presence of restricted lanes. The visible section of the road shows a vehicle traveling without any clear restrictions, but without a wider view or more context, itâ€™s not possible to ascertain the presence of restricted lanes.
