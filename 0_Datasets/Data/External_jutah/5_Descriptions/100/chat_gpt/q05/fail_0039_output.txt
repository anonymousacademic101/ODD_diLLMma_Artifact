NO

Based on the image provided, it is not possible to definitively identify any restricted lanes specifically designated for buses, bicycles, or any other types of vehicles. The available visual information does not show clear indications such as road markings or signage that would designate lanes for the exclusive use of certain types of traffic. We can see multiple vehicles in the lanes, which suggests that the lanes are general-use rather than restricted. However, this conclusion is based on the visible section of the road, and restrictions could exist outside the frame or in areas not clearly visible in the picture.
