YES

In the image provided, it is visible that there is a sign on the right side of the road that reads "TRUCK ROUTE" with an additional note saying "LOCAL DEL" (likely short for Local Delivery). Although this sign does not directly indicate a restricted lane, it does suggest a route specifically designated for trucks, which may imply certain restrictions for traffic flow related to large vehicles. However, there are no clear markings on the road itself that indicate a dedicated bus lane or bicycle lane in the view of the picture. Please note that there could be restrictions not visible in this specific image frame.
