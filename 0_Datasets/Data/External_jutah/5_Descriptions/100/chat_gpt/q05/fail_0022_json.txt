Though this doesn\'t necessarily confirm a dedicated bus or bicycle lane, it does indicate a restriction on the use of the right lane for through-traffic. As for other types of restricted lanes like bus or bicycle lanes, the image does not provide clear indicators of such restrictions; however, the absence of markings or signage specific to bus or bicycle lanes in the visible area suggests that if any exist, they are not captured within this section of the road.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
