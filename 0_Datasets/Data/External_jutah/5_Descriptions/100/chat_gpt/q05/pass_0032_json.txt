Although this sign does not directly indicate a restricted lane, it does suggest a route specifically designated for trucks, which may imply certain restrictions for traffic flow related to large vehicles. However, there are no clear markings on the road itself that indicate a dedicated bus lane or bicycle lane in the view of the picture. Please note that there could be restrictions not visible in this specific image frame.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
