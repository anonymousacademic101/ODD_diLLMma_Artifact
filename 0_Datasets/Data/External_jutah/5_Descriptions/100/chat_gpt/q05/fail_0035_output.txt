NO.

The image does not show any signage or road markings that indicate the presence of restricted lanes specifically for buses or bicycles. The lanes visible in the image appear to be regular traffic lanes. The only restriction visible is the "DO NOT ENTER" sign, which prohibits entry to the road ahead in the opposite direction of travel, but this does not relate to a dedicated bus or bicycle lane.
