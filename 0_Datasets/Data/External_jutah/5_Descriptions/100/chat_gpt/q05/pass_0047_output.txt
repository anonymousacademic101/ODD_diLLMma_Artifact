The presence of a red bus in the lane to the right suggests this is likely a bus lane, which is a type of restricted lane typically reserved for buses. The bus appears to be in motion and other vehicles are not seen in the same lane, indicating it may be designated specifically for bus traffic to improve the efficiency and reliability of bus services. Itâ€™s common in many cities worldwide to have bus-only lanes on major roads to prioritize public transport.
