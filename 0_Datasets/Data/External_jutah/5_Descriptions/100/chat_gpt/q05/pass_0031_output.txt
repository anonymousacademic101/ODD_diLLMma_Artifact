In the image provided, there is a bus in the lane closest to the camera on the right side of the road, suggesting that this lane may be a designated bus lane. The signage or road markings that would normally indicate such a restriction are not visible in this view, but the presence of the bus in this lane could imply that it is a lane with restricted usage.
