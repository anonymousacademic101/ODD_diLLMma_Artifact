NO

Based on the image provided, there are no visible signs indicating restricted lanes on the road directly in front of the viewpoint. The image shows a street scene at dusk or night with no clear markings for bus lanes, bicycle lanes, or other types of restricted lanes. However, the view is limited and only shows a part of the street; without a more comprehensive view, it's impossible to definitively say whether there are restricted lanes elsewhere on the road.
