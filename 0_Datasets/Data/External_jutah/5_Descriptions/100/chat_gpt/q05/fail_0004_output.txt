In the image, we see that the rightmost lane has a sign above it stating "NO TURN ON RED EXCEPT FROM RIGHT LANE," which indicates that the right lane is specifically designated for making right turns at the intersection. This is a form of restriction that designates a specific lane for a specific action, and while it's not reserved for a particular type of vehicle like buses or bicycles, it does impose a limitation on what vehicles in that lane can do. This is a form of traffic management aimed at improving safety and efficiency at intersections.
