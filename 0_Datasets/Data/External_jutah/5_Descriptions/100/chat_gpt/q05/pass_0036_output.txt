YES

The image shows a lane on the right side of the road with markings that indicate it is a special lane. The words "KEEP" and "CLEAR" are painted on the pavement, and these markings typically suggest that this area should not be obstructed, often because it is meant to be kept clear for vehicles like buses to enter and exit a stop, or for emergency vehicles to pass through. While this photo does not explicitly label it as a bus or bicycle lane, the presence of these markings on the pavement implies that there are restrictions on how this part of the road may be used.
