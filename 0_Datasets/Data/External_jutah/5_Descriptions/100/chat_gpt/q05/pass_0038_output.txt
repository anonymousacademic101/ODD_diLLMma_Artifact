The road in the image has tram tracks running along the driving lanes, which are typically restricted to trams (also known as streetcars or trolleys in some regions). These tracks suggest that there is a designated public transportation lane that regular vehicles are not allowed to drive in, except possibly when making certain turns or when directed by traffic signs or rules.
