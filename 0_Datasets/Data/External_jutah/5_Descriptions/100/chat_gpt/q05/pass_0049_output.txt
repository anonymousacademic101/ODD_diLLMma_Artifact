The road in the image has lane markings and symbols that appear to indicate at least one lane with restrictions. The lane on the far left has a symbol that resembles a bus, which suggests it may be a bus lane. Such lanes are typically reserved for buses to facilitate mass transit and reduce congestion. Additionally, there are dashed lines separating some lanes, which might also indicate access restrictions during certain times or for certain types of vehicles. However, without additional context like local traffic laws or signage that might not be visible in the image, this is an educated guess based on the visible road markings.
