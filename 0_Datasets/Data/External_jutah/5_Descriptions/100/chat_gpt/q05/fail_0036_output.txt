The photo shows what appears to be a red-colored bus lane on the right side of the road, as indicated by the color different from the regular lanes and a bus sign painted on the road surface. These lanes are typically restricted to buses only (sometimes taxis and bicycles as well) for all or part of the day to improve public transport efficiency by reducing bus travel times and conflicts with general traffic.
