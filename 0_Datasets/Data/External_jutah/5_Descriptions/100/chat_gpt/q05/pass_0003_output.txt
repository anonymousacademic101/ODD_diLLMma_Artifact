YES

The road in the image has a specific lane designated for bicycles, visible to the right of the picture, demarcated by painted lines and bicycle symbols on the pavement. There is no clear indication of a bus-only lane in this immediate section, but the presence of the bicycle lane indicates that at least one type of vehicle has a restricted lane.
