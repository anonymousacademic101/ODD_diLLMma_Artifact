Based on the image, it is evident that there is a separate lane for bicycles. The bicycle lane is marked by road markings that define a space for cyclists, which is evident with multiple cyclists using the lane on the right side of the road. There is a clear demarcation between the vehicle lane and the bicycle lane, as indicated by the painted lines and symbols on the pavement.
