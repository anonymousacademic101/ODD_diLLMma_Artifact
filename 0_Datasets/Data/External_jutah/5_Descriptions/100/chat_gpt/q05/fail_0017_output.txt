YES

The road in the image has a dedicated bus lane, as indicated by the words "BUS ONLY" painted on the roadway surface on the rightmost lane. There are also green-colored pavement markings, which commonly indicate bike lanes or shared lanes intended for bicycles, suggesting that there might be a space meant for bicycle travel. However, the full layout of the bike lane or shared lane is not entirely clear from this perspective.
