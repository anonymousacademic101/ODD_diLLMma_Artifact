NO.

There are no extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights, or direct sunlight into the camera in this image. The lighting looks natural without harsh glare, and the sky is partly cloudy, diffusing the sunlight. There is no evidence of headlight beams from oncoming traffic that would cause extreme brightness.
