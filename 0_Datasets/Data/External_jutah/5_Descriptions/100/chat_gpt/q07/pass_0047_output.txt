NO

There are no extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight into the camera in this image. The photo depicts a city scene at night; thus, there wouldn't be any sunlight. Moreover, the artificial lights from the vehicles and street lighting are well-exposed and not overbearing. There is no evidence of overexposed or glaring lights that would suggest extremely bright headlights or similar intense light sources directly facing the camera.
