NO

There are no extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight into the camera in this image. The scene is well-lit with natural daylight, and no glare or harsh light effects can be seen coming from the vehicles or the environment. The shadows indicate the sun is higher in the sky, reducing the likelihood of sunlight directly entering the camera lens.
