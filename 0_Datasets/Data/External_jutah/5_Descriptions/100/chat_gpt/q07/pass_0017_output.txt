NO.

The image shows a clear day with sunlight, but there are no signs of extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight into the camera that would cause glare or significant overexposure. The sky is bright but not overexposed, and the headlights of the oncoming cars are not bright enough to be considered "extremely bright."
