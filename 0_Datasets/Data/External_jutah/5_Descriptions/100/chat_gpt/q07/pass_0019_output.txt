The image appears to be taken on an overcast or rainy day, which typically reduces the brightness of external lights. There are reflections from vehicle headlights visible on the wet road surface, but these do not qualify as "extremely bright lights." There is also no direct sunlight visible in the image that would cause glare. The overall brightness of the image suggests diffuse lighting conditions without strong glare sources.
