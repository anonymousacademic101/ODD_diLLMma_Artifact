The lighting in the image appears to be diffuse and even, indicative of an overcast sky or a shaded area. There are no signs of extremely bright lights from oncoming vehicles or direct sunlight that would cause glare or difficulty in seeing things clearly in the photograph. The absence of harsh shadows or bright reflections suggests the light is not causing significant visibility issues for the camera.
