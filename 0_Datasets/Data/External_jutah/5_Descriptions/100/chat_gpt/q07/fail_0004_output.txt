NO

The image appears to be taken in daylight with clear skies, and there are no evident signs of extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight into the camera. The lighting looks relatively even without significant glare, and no headlight beams are visible from the cars in the image. Direct sunlight does not appear to be shining directly into the lens, as the blue sky and scattered clouds do not suggest the presence of the sun in the immediate field of view.
