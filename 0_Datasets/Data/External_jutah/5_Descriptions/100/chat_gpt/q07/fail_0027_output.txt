The image displays a city street scene at dusk with visible artificial lights from street lamps, traffic signals, and illuminated signage. The headlights of oncoming traffic are visible but are not excessively bright, and there is no direct sunlight entering the camera since it appears to be taken after sunset. The overall exposure of the image is well-balanced without any overwhelmingly bright sources of light.
