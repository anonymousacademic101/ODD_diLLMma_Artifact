NO

There are no extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights, nor is there direct sunlight glaring into the camera lens. The image appears to be taken during the day under clear sky conditions with ambient daylight. The lighting in the photo is even and does not show any significant glare or overexposure that would suggest direct sunlight into the camera or bright headlights from oncoming traffic.
