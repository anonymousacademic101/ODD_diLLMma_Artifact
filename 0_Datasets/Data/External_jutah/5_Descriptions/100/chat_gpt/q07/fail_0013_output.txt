There are no extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight into the camera in this image. The lighting appears to be overcast or ambient city lighting with no harsh glare or reflections indicating strong direct light sources. The conditions seem relatively normal for what appears to be an urban street scene with traffic signals and vehicles.
