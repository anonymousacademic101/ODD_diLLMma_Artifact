The image depicts a night scene with various vehicles at what appears to be a traffic stop. Although there are headlights and streetlights visible, none appear to be extremely bright or causing significant glare that would constitute extremely bright lights shining directly into the camera or oncoming headlights that are blindingly bright. The ambient light is well-balanced, and there is no direct sunlight because it is nighttime.
