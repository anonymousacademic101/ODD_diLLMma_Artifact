The image shows a city street at night with various sources of lighting, including street lamps, traffic lights, and vehicle headlights. However, none of these lights are "extremely bright" to the point where they cause significant glare or overexposure in the photo. The lights visible are typical of a nighttime urban scene and do not indicate direct sunlight or overpowering oncoming headlights that would cause difficulty viewing the scene. The illumination is moderate and does not overwhelm the camera's exposure.
