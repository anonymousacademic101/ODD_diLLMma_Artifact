NO.

The photograph shows a city street with a clear sky, but there is no sign of direct sunlight overwhelming the exposure of the image nor are there any headlights visible that are producing extremely bright lights. The lighting in the image is well balanced, neither too bright nor too dark, and does not exhibit the glare typically associated with oncoming headlights or direct sunlight into the camera lens.
