NO

There are no extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights, nor is there direct sunlight into the camera. The image appears to have been taken in the evening or at night, and the light sources in the photo are relatively balanced and typical for a nighttime urban street scene, with streetlights, building lights, and the rear lights of cars. There is a bright light source near the top of the frame; however, it does not have the characteristics of oncoming headlights or direct sunlight, and does not cause the kind of glare or bloom that would be considered "extremely bright" in the context of the question.
