The sky is bright and blue, indicating a sunny day, but there is no evidence of direct sunlight into the camera that would cause glare or extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights that would obscure the scene; the sun's angle does not appear to be aligned with the camera's viewpoint. The lighting seems even and free of harsh bright spots that would usually suggest strong headlight glare or direct sunlight interference."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
