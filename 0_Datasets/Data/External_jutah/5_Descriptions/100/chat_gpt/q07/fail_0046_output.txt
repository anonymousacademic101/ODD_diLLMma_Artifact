There are no extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight into the camera in the image provided. The photo appears to have been taken during dusk or dawn, with dim street lighting and the blue glow of emergency vehicle lights, but none of these lights is overpowering the scene or causing a glare that would indicate extremely bright lights directed at the camera.
