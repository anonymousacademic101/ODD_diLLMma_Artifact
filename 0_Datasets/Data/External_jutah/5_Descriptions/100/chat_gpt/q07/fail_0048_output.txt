The lighting in the image is generally balanced without any extreme brightness from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight. There are headlights visible from the traffic, but they do not appear overly bright in the context of the photo. The sky is dark, indicating that it is either nighttime or the photo was taken during low light conditions, thus there is no direct sunlight. The lights of the city and vehicles provide illumination, but none are so bright as to dominate the scene or cause significant glare into the camera.
