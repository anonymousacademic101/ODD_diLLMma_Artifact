NO.

The image appears to be taken during daylight hours with overcast or diffused lighting, resulting in a balanced exposure without harsh bright spots. There are no visible instances of extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight that would cause significant glare or overexposure in the photo. The street and building lights are off, and no reflections suggest strong sunlight. The sky has a soft lighting condition, indicating the sun is not directly shining into the camera. The absence of lens flare or blown-out areas in the image further supports the absence of extremely bright light sources in the view.
