The lights in the image are typical of urban night-time conditions with various artificial light sources. There are illuminated street lamps, vehicle headlights, and taillights, and the ambient glow from building windows and signage. None of these lights are extremely bright or overexposed in the photo to suggest harsh oncoming headlights or direct sunlight into the camera lens. Instead, the lighting appears to be well-balanced and typical for a street scene after dark.
