NO.

In the image, there are no extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights because there are no vehicles with their headlights on facing the camera. There is also no direct sunlight into the camera causing glare or overexposure; the image is well-lit with natural daylight and the sky is clear. The sun is positioned high and appears to be behind the camera or at an angle that does not result in direct sunlight into the lens.
