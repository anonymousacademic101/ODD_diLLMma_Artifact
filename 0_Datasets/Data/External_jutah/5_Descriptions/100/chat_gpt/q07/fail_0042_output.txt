NO

In this image, there are no extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight into the camera. The lighting appears to be well balanced across the scene with no signs of overexposure or lens flare that would commonly be associated with such bright lights. The sky is partly cloudy with the sun positioned higher in the sky, indicating that it is not shining directly into the camera lens, and we do not see any vehicle headlights that are turned on and facing the camera.
