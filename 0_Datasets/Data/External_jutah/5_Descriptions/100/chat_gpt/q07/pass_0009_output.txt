NO

There are no extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights, as the cars in the image have their headlights off, and there is no direct sunlight into the camera that obscures the image. The lighting in the photo is even, with clear visibility, and the sky is bright due to natural daylight without resulting in glare or overexposure in the camera lens.
