The road in the image appears to be well-maintained with two distinct lanes marked by yellow lines. It is not particularly narrow; instead, it seems wide enough to comfortably accommodate two-way traffic. The road does curve slightly to the left in the distance, following the contour of the coastline, but it does not show characteristics of a highly winding road where sharp turns or hairpin bends are common. It provides substantial space for vehicles to navigate the curve without the tight constraints often found on narrow, winding mountain roads.
