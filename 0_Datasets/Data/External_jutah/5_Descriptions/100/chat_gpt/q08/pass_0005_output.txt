NO.

The road in the image appears to be a standard, urban street with multiple lanes, relatively straight alignment, and clear markings. It does not show the characteristics of a narrow or winding road, as those would typically consist of single lanes, tight curves, and possibly few to no markings. This road seems to comfortably accommodate two-way traffic with delineated lanes for vehicles. The presence of traffic signals, road signs, and urban infrastructure further supports the classification of this road as a typical city street rather than a narrow, winding one.
