The road in the image does not appear to be narrow or winding. It looks like a straight urban street with multiple lanes, providing ample space for vehicles to travel and maneuver. The presence of traffic signals, marked lanes, and urban infrastructure also indicates it is designed to accommodate regular city traffic rather than being a narrow or winding road.
