NO

The road in the image appears to be a multi-lane road in an urban setting, neither narrow nor winding. It seems to be relatively straight and wide enough to accommodate multiple lanes of traffic in both directions. The presence of vehicles driving comfortably side by side further indicates that it is not narrow or winding.
