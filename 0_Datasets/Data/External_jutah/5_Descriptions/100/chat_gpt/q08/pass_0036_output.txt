NO.

The road in the image shown appears to be relatively straight in the visible stretch, with clear lane markings and enough width to accommodate multiple lanes of traffic. There are also parked cars along the side, indicating that the road is not too narrow. While there could be undetected winding sections not visible in the image, nothing in the current view suggests that the road is narrow or winding.
