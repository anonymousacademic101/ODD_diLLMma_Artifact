The road in the image does not appear to be narrow and winding; instead, it looks to be a multi-lane urban street with enough space for multiple lanes of traffic. The vehicles are stopped and in parallel lanes, indicating a wider road rather than a narrow one. Furthermore, there is no visible evidence of winding turns in the immediate viewpoint, as the road stretches straight into the distance, lined with urban buildings and infrastructure.
