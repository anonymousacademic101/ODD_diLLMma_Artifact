The road depicted in the image appears to be relatively straight and not particularly narrow, especially by urban standards. There's no evidence in the visible portion of the image that suggests it is winding. The street is lined with buildings and includes intersections with traffic lights, which is typical for an urban street and does not indicate a narrow or winding road.
