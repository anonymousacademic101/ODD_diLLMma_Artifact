NO

The road in the image appears to be straight and with multiple lanes in each direction, as indicated by the presence of several vehicles traveling parallel to each other. The road does not show evidence of being winding, and the width of the lanes suggests it is not narrow. There are also traffic cones suggesting some form of road work, but this does not inherently make the road narrow or winding.
