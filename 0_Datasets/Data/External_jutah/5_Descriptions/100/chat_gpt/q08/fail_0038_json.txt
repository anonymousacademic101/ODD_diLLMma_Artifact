There is a slight right curve ahead, but this does not make the overall road "winding" as that term is typically understood to mean multiple curves or bends in quick succession. Additionally, there\'s a roundabout which suggests the road design is meant to handle moderate to high volumes of traffic with ease rather than being a narrow, less traveled route.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
