The image shows a street in an urban setting with multiple lanes, traffic signals, and clear, painted road markings. The road appears to be relatively straight in the portion visible in the image, without any evident sharp bends or curves that would classify it as winding. It is also not narrow given the width that accommodates multiple vehicles side by side.
