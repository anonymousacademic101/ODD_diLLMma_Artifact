The road in the image appears to be a straight section of a city street rather than narrow and winding. It is lined with buildings on one side and a landscaped median on the other, providing ample space for vehicles to pass through comfortably. The visible section of the road does not show any sharp curves or narrow passages that would make it qualify as winding or narrow.
