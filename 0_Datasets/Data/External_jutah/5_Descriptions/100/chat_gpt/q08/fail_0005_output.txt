The road in the image appears to be a wide two-lane highway with visible lane markings and shoulders on both sides. It is not shown as having tight turns or hairpin bends that would make it winding in the section visible in the photo. It seems to follow a gentle curve along the coastline, providing ample space for vehicles to navigate without the constraints typically associated with narrow and winding roads.
