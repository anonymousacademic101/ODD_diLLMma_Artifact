The road in the image is not narrow and winding; it appears to be a multi-lane, straight urban road with traffic signals, suitable for handling a significant amount of traffic. The buildings and the layout indicate an urban setting with intersections, rather than a narrow and winding road which you might find in more hilly or rural areas.
