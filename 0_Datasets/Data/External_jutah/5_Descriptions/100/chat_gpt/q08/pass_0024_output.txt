NO.

The road in the image is a multi-lane highway, which appears to be wide with multiple lanes for traffic in both directions, demarcated by clear lane markings. The highway has gentle curves but does not exhibit the characteristics of a narrow and winding road, which typically has sharp turns, limited driving space, and may lack such clear separations between lanes or directions of travel. Additionally, the presence of overpasses and traffic signs indicates that this is a major road designed to accommodate high-speed traffic and greater volumes of vehicles, which further supports that it is not narrow and winding.
