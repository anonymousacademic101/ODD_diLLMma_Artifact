NO.

The road visible in the image appears to be wide enough for multiple lanes of traffic and is not displaying any immediate curves or bends that would indicate it is winding. The setting seems to be urban with proper street markings, signage, and a traffic light, which are characteristics not typically associated with narrow and winding roads.
