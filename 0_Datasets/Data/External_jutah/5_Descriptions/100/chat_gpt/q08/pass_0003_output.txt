The road depicted in the image is not narrow and winding. It appears to be a wide, multi-lane urban street with straight sections, as evidenced by the multiple lanes visible in both directions, traffic lights, and flat terrain. The road seems to accommodate a significant amount of traffic and is designed to facilitate an urban traffic flow, rather than a narrow and winding road that would typically be found in more rural or mountainous areas with tight turns and limited driving space.
