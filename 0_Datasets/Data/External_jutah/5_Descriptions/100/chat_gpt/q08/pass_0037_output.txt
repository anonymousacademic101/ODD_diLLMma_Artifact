NO

This road is not narrow and winding; it is a multi-lane, straight urban street with clearly marked lanes and surrounded by tall buildings, typical of a city environment. The vehicles are aligned in a straight fashion, and there is no evidence of the road curving or being particularly narrow in the visible section.
