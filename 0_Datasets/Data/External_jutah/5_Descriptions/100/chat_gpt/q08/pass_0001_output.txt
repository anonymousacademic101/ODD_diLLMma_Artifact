The road does not appear to be extremely narrow, as there is enough space for at least two lanes, indicated by the road markings. The curve in the road is gentle rather than sharp and winding. Additionally, the lanes are clearly marked, and there are safety barriers, suggesting it is designed to handle traffic safely without the constraints often associated with very narrow and winding roads.
