NO.

The road in the image provided is not narrow and winding; it is a multi-lane urban street with clear lane markings and appears to be straight in the section visible in the photograph. The street is wide enough to accommodate multiple lanes of traffic and has space for a median. The urban setting and infrastructure suggest it is designed to handle a significant volume of traffic common in city environments.
