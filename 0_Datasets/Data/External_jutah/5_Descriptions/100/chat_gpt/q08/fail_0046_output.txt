The image appears to show a road in an urban setting with a straight segment visible. There are no visible sharp turns or bends that would indicate the road is winding. The width of the road cannot be determined definitively from this angle, but it does not appear to be particularly narrow given the context suggests it is in a city with multiple lanes.
