NO.

The road in the image appears to be a wide, multi-lane road with a straight path visible in the immediate vicinity, not a narrow and winding one. There are multiple lanes for traffic, traffic signals, and visible lane markings that suggest it is designed to accommodate a significant amount of traffic in an urban setting. The view does not show any sharp curves or bends that would indicate the road is winding.
