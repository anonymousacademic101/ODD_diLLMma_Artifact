The road in the image does not appear to be narrow and winding. It looks like a typical straight, urban street with multiple lanes and controlled intersections, as indicated by traffic lights and clear lane markings. It is set in an urban environment with buildings close to the street, suggesting it is designed to handle a fair amount of traffic.
