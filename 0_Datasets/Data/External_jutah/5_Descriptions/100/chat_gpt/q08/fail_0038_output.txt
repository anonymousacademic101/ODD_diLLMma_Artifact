The road shown in the image appears to be relatively wide, accommodating at least two lanes of traffic comfortably, and it does not show any immediate sharp bends that would categorize it as "winding." There is a slight right curve ahead, but this does not make the overall road "winding" as that term is typically understood to mean multiple curves or bends in quick succession. Additionally, there's a roundabout which suggests the road design is meant to handle moderate to high volumes of traffic with ease rather than being a narrow, less traveled route.
