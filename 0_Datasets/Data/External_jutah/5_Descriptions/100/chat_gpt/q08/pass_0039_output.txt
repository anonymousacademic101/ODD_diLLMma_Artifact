NO.

The reason is that the road in the image appears to be a multi-lane urban road with several lanes visible in each direction, indicative of a major street or avenue that is designed to accommodate a significant amount of traffic. The road does not show any sharp turns or curves that would classify it as winding. It seems to be relatively straight as far as the image allows us to see, and there is no indication that the road is unusually narrow for the volume and type of traffic it supports.
