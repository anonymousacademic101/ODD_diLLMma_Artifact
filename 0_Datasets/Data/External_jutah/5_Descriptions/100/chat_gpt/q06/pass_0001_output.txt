YES

There are visible signs that indicate construction on the road ahead. The presence of the "KEEP RIGHT" sign with an arrow, paired with orange traffic cones and the typical yellow warning signs associated with road work suggest that there could be construction activity on or near the road we are driving on. Additionally, the presence of barricades on the left side further supports that there may be some form of construction or road maintenance taking place.
