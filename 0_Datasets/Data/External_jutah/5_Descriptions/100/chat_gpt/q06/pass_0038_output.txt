NO

I cannot see any visible signs of construction such as road work machinery, construction barriers, cones, or active work crews on the visible portion of the road in the image provided. The road appears to be open to traffic with vehicles driving and parked on the side, suggesting that there is no ongoing construction obstructing the road at this location.
