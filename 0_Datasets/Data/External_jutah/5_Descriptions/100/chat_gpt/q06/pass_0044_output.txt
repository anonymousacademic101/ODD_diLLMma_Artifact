NO

Based on the image provided, there is no clear indication of road construction happening directly on the road where the vehicles are driving. The road appears to be clear with normal traffic flow, and while there is scaffolding on the side of the road, this is more indicative of construction or maintenance on a building rather than on the road itself. Without visible signs, equipment, or work crews specific to road construction, it is reasonable to conclude that the road itself is not currently undergoing construction.
