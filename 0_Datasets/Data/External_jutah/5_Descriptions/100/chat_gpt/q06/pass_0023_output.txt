Although the image shows a clear road where vehicles are driving without any immediate signs of construction barriers or equipment on the roadway itself, there is scaffolding visible on the building in the background which indicates construction activity nearby. Generally, when scaffolding is erected around buildings, particularly in urban areas, it can be an indication of ongoing maintenance, renovation, or construction work. While the road itself might not be under construction, the proximity of the scaffolding suggests construction activity in the vicinity.
