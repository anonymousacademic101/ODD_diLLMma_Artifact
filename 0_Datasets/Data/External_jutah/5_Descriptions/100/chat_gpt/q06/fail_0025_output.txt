There are clear signs of construction on the road we are viewing. Traffic cones and barrels are set up around an area of the street, indicating that a section is cordoned off, typically for construction or maintenance activities. Additionally, there appears to be a temporary traffic sign among the cones, further implying ongoing construction work.
