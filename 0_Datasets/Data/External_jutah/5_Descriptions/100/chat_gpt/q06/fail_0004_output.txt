NO.

Based on the image you provided, there is no visible construction taking place on the road in view. All lanes appear to be clear, and there are no signs of construction equipment, workers, barriers, or any usual indications of road construction. However, without a view beyond what is shown in the image, I cannot confirm the conditions of the road beyond this vantage point.
