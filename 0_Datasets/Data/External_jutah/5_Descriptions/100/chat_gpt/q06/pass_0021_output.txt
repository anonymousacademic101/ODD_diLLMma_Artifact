YES

The road in the image appears to have a wet surface indicating recent activity, and there are some markings and patches on the road that could be consistent with recent or ongoing construction work. Additionally, there is a streaked pattern on the road surface that could imply some form of maintenance or construction process has recently been applied. However, there are no visible signs of active construction equipment or barriers in this specific frame of the image. The presence of construction work can vary along different sections of the road, and this image only provides a limited view.
