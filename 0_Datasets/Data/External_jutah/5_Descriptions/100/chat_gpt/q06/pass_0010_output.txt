NO

Based on the image provided, there is no visible construction taking place on the road itself. The traffic appears to be flowing normally, without any construction barriers, signs, or equipment that would indicate active road construction. There are no lane closures or detours that are typically associated with roadwork. However, there is some form of construction or maintenance activity visible on the sidewalk to the right, indicated by the fenced-off area and the covered walkway, which suggests that there might be a building or sidewalk-related construction, but the road we are driving on is not obstructed by construction work.
