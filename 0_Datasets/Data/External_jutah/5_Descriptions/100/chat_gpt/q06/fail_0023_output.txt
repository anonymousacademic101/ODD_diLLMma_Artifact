NO.

The image provided shows a parking lot rather than a road, and there is no clear evidence of construction on the parking lot itself. The vehicles are parked, and the area looks to be in use for its intended purpose. While there is orange fencing that could potentially indicate some form of demarcation or work in the background, it is not on the parking lot surface itself, and thus it does not confirm construction on this specific section that could be interpreted as a road by some.
