Based on the image provided, there is no visible construction on the road itself where the vehicle is driving. The road appears to be clear of construction equipment, barriers, or signs that would indicate ongoing construction activities. However, the presence of scaffolding and protective barriers on the side of the road suggests there may be construction related to the buildings adjacent to the street but not on the road itself.
