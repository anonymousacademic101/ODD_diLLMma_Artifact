In the image, on the right side of the road, there appears to be a construction barricade and a pedestrian detour sign, indicating that sidewalk or street construction is occurring just outside the field of view. While the construction is not directly on the road we are "driving" on, it is adjacent to it and likely related to the roadway, affecting the overall traffic and pedestrian flow.
