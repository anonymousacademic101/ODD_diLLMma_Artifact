NO

The image shows a city street with no visible signs of road construction taking place. While there is construction scaffolding evident on the building to the left, this does not indicate that the road itself is undergoing construction. The traffic appears to be flowing smoothly without any road construction barriers, equipment, or signage that would suggest active roadwork on the street we are driving on.
