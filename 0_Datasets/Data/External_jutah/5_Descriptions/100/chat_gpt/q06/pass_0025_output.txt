YES

While there are no obvious signs of active construction work such as construction vehicles or workers, the presence of barriers on the left side of the road and the absence of any marked lanes might suggest that there is ongoing construction on the road. These barriers often indicate that part of the road is sectioned off for repair or construction work. However, without additional context or signs indicating construction, it is not possible to definitively confirm if construction is currently active or if the barriers are there for a different reason.
