The image is clear and there are no signs of heavy rain, snow, fog, or other adverse weather conditions that would significantly impair visibility. The sky is dusky, suggesting it's either dawn or dusk, but the streetlights and vehicle lights are clear and not diffused, as would be expected in poor visibility conditions. The details in the scene, such as the vehicles, buildings, and street signs, are also sharp and well-defined, indicating that visibility is good.
