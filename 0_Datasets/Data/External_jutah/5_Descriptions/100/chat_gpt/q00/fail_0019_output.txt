The image shows wet road conditions and overcast skies, which suggests recent or ongoing rain. The presence of rain can lead to reduced visibility for drivers and pedestrians due to the precipitation and potential splash from other vehicles. While the image isn't depicting extremely poor visibility such as a heavy rainstorm, there is evidence of adverse weather that could affect visibility to some degree.
