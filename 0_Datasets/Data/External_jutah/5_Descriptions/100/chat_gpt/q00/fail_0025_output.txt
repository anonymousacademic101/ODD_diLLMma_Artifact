The image appears to be clear without any signs of heavy rain, snow, fog, or other adverse weather conditions that would impair visibility. The scene is well-lit with shadows indicating the presence of sunlight, and the sky partly visible through the structure overhead is relatively clear. We can see the vehicles, traffic signals, and other elements in the image quite sharply, which suggests that visibility is indeed good.
