The image does not depict poor visibility due to heavy rain, snow, fog, or adverse weather conditions. The skyline is relatively clear, objects at various distances are visible, and there are no visible weather elements such as rain droplets, snowflakes, or mist that would indicate reduced visibility. The lighting conditions and the cloudiness of the sky suggest an overcast day, but there is no evidence of extreme weather impacting visibility.
