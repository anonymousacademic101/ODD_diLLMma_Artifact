NO

The image is clear, and there don't appear to be any adverse weather conditions like heavy rain, snow, or fog affecting visibility. You can clearly see street signs, vehicles, and buildings, and the lighting from buildings and streetlights is sharp and bright, with no visible diffusion or distortion that would indicate poor visibility conditions.
