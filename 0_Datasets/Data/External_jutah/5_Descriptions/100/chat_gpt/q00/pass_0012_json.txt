The slight blur effect present in the photo is likely due to the motion of the vehicles and the camera's exposure settings rather than any visibility-impairing weather conditions. The lighting in the tunnel appears to be well-maintained, allowing for good visibility."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
