The visibility in the image is not poor due to heavy rain, snow, fog, or adverse weather conditions. Objects are clear and details are visible in the distance, which indicates that visibility is not significantly impaired by the weather. While the sky appears overcast, suggesting that it may be cloudy or that there was recent rainfall (evidenced by the wet pavement), there is no active severe weather obscuring the view.
