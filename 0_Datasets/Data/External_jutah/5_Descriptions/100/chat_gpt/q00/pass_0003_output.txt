NO.

The image shows an overcast sky with clouds, but there are no visible signs of heavy rain, snow, fog, or other adverse weather conditions that would significantly impair visibility. Objects in the distance are still relatively clear, and the lighting conditions, while slightly dim due to cloud cover, do not suggest poor visibility typically associated with harsh weather conditions.
