NO

The image shows a tunnel with clear internal conditions, and there is no indication of poor visibility like heavy rain, snow, fog, or adverse weather conditions that one would expect to see outside of such a structure. The slight blur effect present in the photo is likely due to the motion of the vehicles and the camera's exposure settings rather than any visibility-impairing weather conditions. The lighting in the tunnel appears to be well-maintained, allowing for good visibility.
