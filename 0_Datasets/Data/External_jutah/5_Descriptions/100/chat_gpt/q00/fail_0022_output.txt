NO

The visibility in the image appears to be clear. There are no signs of heavy rain, snow, fog, or adverse weather conditions obstructing the view. The sky is overcast, suggesting possible rain, but the absence of raindrops on the camera lens or heavy precipitation in the air indicates that if it is indeed raining, it's not heavy enough to significantly reduce visibility. The wet road suggests that it might have rained recently, but the current weather in the image does not seem to cause poor visibility.
