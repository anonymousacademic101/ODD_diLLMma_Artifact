The image appears to be taken in overcast or rainy conditions, as evidenced by the wet road surfaces, the reflections of vehicle lights on the street, and the overall gray sky, which can contribute to reduced visibility. However, the extent of visibility reduction is not severe since the buildings, vehicles, and traffic lights are still clearly observable.
