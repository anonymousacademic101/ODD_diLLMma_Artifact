NO

The image is simply out of focus; there are no indications of poor visibility due to weather conditions like heavy rain, snow, or fog. The blur is consistent across the entire image, suggesting a focus issue with the camera rather than an environmental visibility issue. Shadows and bright areas indicate that the weather might actually be clear.
