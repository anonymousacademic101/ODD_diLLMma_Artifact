NO

The image appears to be clear and well-defined without any noticeable smears, blurs, or obstructions that would suggest the camera lens was covered or obstructed by mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products. There are water droplets visible, which indicates it might be raining, but these droplets do not seem to be on the camera lens itself, as the overall image is not distorted.
