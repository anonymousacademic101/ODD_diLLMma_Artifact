NO

The image appears clear and without any noticeable distortions or obstructions that would suggest the camera lens was covered or damaged by mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products. The visibility is good, and there are no apparent artifacts to indicate such obstructions. The blurriness seen in some parts of the image, particularly where the pedestrians are, suggests motion blur rather than an issue with the camera lens itself.
