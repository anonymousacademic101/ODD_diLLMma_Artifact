The image is clear, with no signs of distortion or obstructions that would be indicative of the camera being covered or damaged by substances like mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products. All elements in the photo—the road, landscape, sky, and ocean—are distinctly visible, and there is no evidence of residue or smears that would suggest the camera lens was compromised.
