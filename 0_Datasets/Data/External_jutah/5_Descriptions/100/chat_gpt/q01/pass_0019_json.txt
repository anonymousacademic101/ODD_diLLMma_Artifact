The details in the scene are distinct and sharply captured, which would not be the case if the lens were significantly obscured or damaged. The presence of raindrops on the road and wet surfaces suggests that the weather is rainy, which could result in water droplets on the camera lens, but this does not seem to have affected the clarity of the image significantly.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
