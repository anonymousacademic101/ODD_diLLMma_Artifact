The irregular, soft, smeared lighter areas, mainly noticeable in the darker parts of the image, suggest that the lens had a substance like a fingerprint or a smudge spread on it. This kind of residue can slightly blur and distort the light coming into the camera, leading to the visual effect seen in the image.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
