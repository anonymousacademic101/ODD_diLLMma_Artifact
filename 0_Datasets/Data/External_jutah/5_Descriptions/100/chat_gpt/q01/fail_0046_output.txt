The image appears to show smudge marks and distortion, which are more indicative of the camera lens being dirty or having something smeared on its surface, rather than being obstructed, covered, or damaged by mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products. The irregular, soft, smeared lighter areas, mainly noticeable in the darker parts of the image, suggest that the lens had a substance like a fingerprint or a smudge spread on it. This kind of residue can slightly blur and distort the light coming into the camera, leading to the visual effect seen in the image.
