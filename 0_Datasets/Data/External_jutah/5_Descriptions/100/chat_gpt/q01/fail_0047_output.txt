NO

There doesn't seem to be any obvious obstruction, covering, or damage to the lens from mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products. The image is clear, and although it's taken at night which results in some lens flare from the lights and perhaps slight graininess from the high ISO setting necessary for low-light photography, these are common characteristics of night photography and do not suggest damage or obstruction to the camera.
