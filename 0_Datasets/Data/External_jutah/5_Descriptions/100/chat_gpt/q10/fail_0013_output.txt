You're looking at a city street scene with several noteworthy details:

1. Road Structure: The road is multi-laned with markings for both straight-going traffic and turning lanes. There's a pedestrian crosswalk marked with white stripes.

2. Road Signs: Traffic signals for vehicles are visible showing a green light, which indicates that traffic is free to move forward or turn if in the correct lane. The road sign on the right indicates a left turn lane with a green arrow pointing up, suggesting that drivers can proceed with a left turn when the arrow is lit. A "ONE WAY" sign also indicates the flow of traffic is in one direction on the adjacent street.

3. Traffic: There are multiple vehicles visible, including a white car in the foreground turning left, and a row of cars moving straight ahead or waiting in traffic.

4. Pedestrians: No pedestrians are visible in the crosswalk or on the sidewalk at the moment the picture was taken.

5. Time of Day: It appears to be daylight, likely daytime with overcast sky due to the lack of harsh shadows.

6. Attention Points for Driving: Drivers would need to pay attention to the traffic signals, stay in the correct lanes for their intended direction, watch for the possibility of pedestrians stepping onto the crosswalk as they approach the intersection, and note the construction scaffolding on the left which could potentially obstruct the sidewalk or part of the street.

7. Surroundings: There's construction scaffolding on a building to the left, indicating ongoing construction work. Shop fronts are visible including one with signage that reads "Open During Construction", and tall buildings in the background suggest it's a downtown area within a large city.

8. Environment: Trees line the street, which enhances the urban environment and provides greenery.
