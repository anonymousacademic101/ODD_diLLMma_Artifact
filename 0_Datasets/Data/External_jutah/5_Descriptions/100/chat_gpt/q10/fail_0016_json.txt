Here are the details:\n\n1. **Road Configuration** - The road appears to be a multi-lane, one-way street with an additional lane curving off to the right. The street curves to the right, which indicates either a corner or a change in direction for the road. The paint on the road consists of solid white lines, indicating lane divisions.\n\n2. **Traffic lights** - There are traffic signals in the view, and they are showing red, indicating that vehicles in this direction should stop.\n\n3. **Road Signs** - There\'s a green road sign pointing to the left that reads "Woodward" suggesting that Woodward Avenue is accessible by turning left. An overhead sign indicates "South Woodward" with arrows pointing straight and right, suggesting that the road straight ahead and the curve to the right both lead to South Woodward.\n\n4. **Pedestrians** - There are a few pedestrians crossing the street. Two seem to be walking across the intersection and one person is standing at the corner, suggesting the presence of a pedestrian crosswalk.\n\n5. **Time of Day** - The sky is overcast, and the visibility is clear. The image appears to be taken during daylight hours, assuming a typical day without any atypical weather conditions or events that would affect light levels.\n\n6. **Surroundings** - The surrounding area includes a mixture of architecture, indicating an urban setting with both heritage buildings and more modern structures. There is landscaping with flowers and bushes in the median, as well as street lamps and traffic light poles.\n\n7. **Other Details** - A white commercial vehicle (Sysco truck) can be seen on the left side of the image, partially obstructing the view of the crosswalk from the perspective of this image. The presence of the Sysco truck indicates that there might be a delivery in progress to a nearby establishment. There are also stationary vehicles seen to the right, parked or waiting at the traffic light.\n\nDrivers should pay attention to the red traffic lights, indicating a requirement to stop; also, make note of the pedestrians using the crosswalk, providing them the right of way as they cross the road. Additionally, drivers must be aware of any potential instructions from road signage and anticipate turning vehicles given the presence of turning lanes.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
