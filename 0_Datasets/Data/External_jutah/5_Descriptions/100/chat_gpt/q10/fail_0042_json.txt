An intersection is visible right in front of the camera view.\n- Vehicles: There are several vehicles visible in the image, including cars and a commercial truck with a tagline "Tastes Great" on the back. The vehicles are mostly in motion, with brake lights visible on some indicating deceleration.\n- Construction: There is a construction barrier with signage that reads "Future home of Corktown Station," indicating ongoing or upcoming construction related to the Ontario Line, a transit project.\n- Pedestrians: A group of pedestrians is visible on the right side of the image by the construction fencing, and they appear to be waiting to cross the street. There are pedestrian signals attached to the traffic signal poles.\n- Environment: Modern buildings, presumably residential or commercial, line the streets, and the sky is relatively clear with a few clouds, indicating good weather conditions.\n- Safety signs: A black sign with white lettering that reads "POST NO BILLS" is present on the construction hoarding near the bottom left of the image.\n\nFrom the image, it seems to be a typical urban setting where drivers must be vigilant of changing traffic signals, construction zones, and pedestrian activity.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
