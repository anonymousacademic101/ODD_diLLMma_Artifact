Here are the details:\n\n- Road Structure and Markings: The road is a wide, multi-lane urban street with marked lanes and a pedestrian crosswalk. The white striped lines suggest that it\'s a zebra crossing.\n- Traffic Lights: There are multiple traffic signal lights visible. The traffic signal ahead is red for vehicles intending to continue straight, while the light for the left turn lane indicates a flashing yellow arrow, suggesting caution for turning vehicles and yielding to oncoming traffic or pedestrians.\n- Road Signs: There is a "No Turn on Red" sign for the right lane, indicating that vehicles may not turn when the light is red. There\'s also a sign indicating "One Way" on the right side of the street, suggesting that the intersecting road, Delaware Street, may be a one-way street.\n- Vehicles and Traffic: There are cars parked on both sides of the street, but the traffic in the immediate lanes appears very light with no vehicles seen approaching the intersection.\n- Pedestrians: There are pedestrians on both sides of the crosswalk, with one pedestrian in the middle of crossing the street. Due to the traffic lights and the presence of pedestrians, a driver approaching this intersection would need to stop and only proceed when it is safe and legal to do so.\n- Time of Day: It is daytime with ample natural light. The shadows suggest it could be morning or afternoon but likely not close to noon as the shadows are elongated.\n- E-scooters: On the bottom right of the image, there are two electric scooters parked on the sidewalk, which are likely part of a dockless scooter-sharing system.\n\nThe image also depicts that the weather is clear, and visibility is good for drivers and pedestrians. Based on the traffic lights and signs, it is clear that the intersection is controlled with specific rules for turning and crossing, emphasizing the importance of attention to signals and road signs while driving or walking in the area.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
