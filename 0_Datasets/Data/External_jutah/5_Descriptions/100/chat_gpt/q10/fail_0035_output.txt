This image depicts an urban street scene with several traffic-related elements to consider:

1. Road Structure: The road appears to have multiple lanes with a concrete divider separating opposing traffic flows. There is a turnoff to the right that is clearly marked with road signs.

2. Road Signs: There are "Do Not Enter" signs posted on the divider, indicating that it is not permissible to enter the lanes coming towards the viewer's perspective. The "Do Not Enter" signs are accompanied by a "One Way" sign that points to the right, guiding drivers to the correct direction on the road ahead. There is also a yellow "Yield" sign on the right side of the road, indicating that drivers should yield to other traffic or pedestrians before proceeding.

3. Traffic: The traffic light facing the viewer is green, signaling that it is okay to proceed in the direction they are facing, or to turn right. There is no visible oncoming traffic in the lanes in front of the viewer. There is a red bus on the right lane going away from the viewer's perspective, labeled with the number '83.'

4. Pedestrians: There is one pedestrian visible, walking away from the camera on the right side of the street. They seem to be walking within a marked crosswalk, following pedestrian traffic rules.

5. Time of Day: Given the strong shadows and the quality of the light, it appears to be daytime, likely around midday, as the shadows are short, suggesting the sun is high in the sky.

6. Additional Details: The scene is surrounded by urban architecture, including high-rise buildings, which suggest that this is a metropolitan area. You can see a sign for a Marriott hotel on the left, indicating the presence of amenities and services for residents or visitors. A manhole cover is visible in the foreground of the image, and there is also some construction signage and barriers indicating potential road work or sidewalk maintenance.

Drivers in this scenario should pay attention to traffic signals, the "Do Not Enter" and "One Way" signs, as well as the pedestrian using the crosswalk. It's also important to be aware of any potential deviations in the usual traffic pattern due to the construction or maintenance work indicated by the barriers.
