The scene includes the following details:\n\n- We are looking at an intersection with the traffic light showing green for through traffic and a red left-turn arrow, indicating that vehicles must wait before turning left.\n- The street is labeled NE 8 ST, which suggests this may be located in a city with a grid-based street naming system, possibly in the northeastern part of that city.\n- There are some vehicles visible on the road, and it appears to be light traffic at the moment.\n- The tall building closest to the camera is lit with red and white lights, which could be for decorative purposes or to denote some special occasion or event.\n- There is an electronic billboard on the right side displaying an advertisement with text and an image of a person.\n- Apart from the main road, there does not seem to be any pedestrians visible in the image, implying that pedestrian traffic is low at this time.\n- The architecture of the buildings in the background indicates a modern city skyline, possibly in a downtown area with high-rise buildings.\n- Safety signs or signals for pedestrians are not clearly visible in the image.\n- The overall atmosphere of the image appears calm and tranquil, likely due to the time of day and the current level of traffic.\n\nDrivers at this intersection should be prepared to adhere to the traffic signals and be aware of the one-way street signs, indicating the direction in which traffic is flowing.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
