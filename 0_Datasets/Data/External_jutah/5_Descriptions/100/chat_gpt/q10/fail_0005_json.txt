Here are some key points about the road and surroundings:\n\n- The road is a two-lane highway with one lane in each direction, separated by a double yellow line indicating that passing is prohibited.\n- On the right-hand side of the road, there is a shoulder, followed by power lines.\n- The terrain immediately adjacent to the road is barren with some shrubs, dropping off to the coastline where the ocean is visible.\n- There is a vehicle visible in the distance, traveling in the opposite direction.\n- There are no visible pedestrians, cyclists, or animals on or near the road.\n- I do not see any traffic signs in this portion of the road.\n- No traffic lights or intersections are visible in the image.\n- The absence of shadows directly below objects suggests that the picture may have been taken around midday when the sun is high.\n\nDrivers on this road should pay attention to the road's curvature, stay within the speed limit, and be aware of the lack of barriers between the road and the steep drop-off to the sea. Since it's a coastal road, drivers should also be cautious of possible changes in weather conditions or any ocean-related activities that might affect visibility or road conditions."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
