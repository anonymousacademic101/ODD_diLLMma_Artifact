2. Road Signs:
   - Traffic signals are visible, and the one closest to the perspective is green for traffic moving in the direction of the camera.
   - Road signs indicating "Genesee AV" street names are seen at the intersection, suggesting the location is near or at the crossing of Genesee Avenue.
