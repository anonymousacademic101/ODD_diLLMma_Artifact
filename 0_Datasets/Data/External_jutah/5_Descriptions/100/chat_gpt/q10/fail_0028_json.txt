The following factual information can be observed:\n\n- There is a STOP sign, indicating vehicles must come to a complete stop before proceeding.\n- On the STOP sign\'s pole, there appears to be a supplementary sign indicating that drivers must yield to oncoming traffic before proceeding when safe.\n- The road ahead is designated as a ONE WAY street, indicated by the sign to the left of the image.\n- A large arrow painted on the road points to the right, directing traffic to turn right onto the one-way street.\n- To the left of the STOP sign on a separate pole, there is a sign indicating that the road ahead is part of the "North 93" route. This could indicate a state or U.S. highway numbered 93.\n- There are no pedestrians visible in the image.\n- The only visible vehicle is in the opposite lane, and it seems to be moving away from the intersection.\n- It appears to be daytime with clear skies based on the sunlight and shadows.\n- There are traffic cones to the far left and far right, suggesting there may be roadwork or lane changes ahead.\n- No traffic lights are visible, and it appears control at the intersection is managed by road signage alone.\n- There is no direct indication of the speed limit, though the road structure and STOP sign suggest drivers should approach with caution.\n- The landscape suggests a dry climate with hills or mountains comprised of rocky terrain.\n- The image does not show any immediate hazards or obstructions in the lane where the car would be turning right, signaling that it would typically be safe to proceed after stopping and yielding to any oncoming traffic.\n\nDrivers at this intersection would need to stop at the STOP sign, check for oncoming traffic from the left (as it\'s a one-way street), and proceed with a right turn when safe to do so.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
