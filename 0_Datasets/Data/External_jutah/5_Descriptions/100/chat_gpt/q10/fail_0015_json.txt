The day appears to be clear with daylight conditions, suggesting it might be daytime. Traffic is light with a few vehicles present at the intersection. The road structure seems to be a typical urban setting with multiple lanes.\n\nThe street sign indicates the intersection is at Broadway. Overhead, we have green directional signs indicating access to Interstate 90 (I-90) with the destinations marked as:\n\n- To I-90 West, Toll Road, Chicago, pointing straight ahead.\n- To I-90 East, Toll Road, Ohio, directing traffic to the right.\n\nThe roadway numbers US 12, US 20, and US 53 are tagged alongside the directions, indicating these routes converge or run concurrently with the direction towards I-90.\n\nThere is an overhead railway bridge with a train composed of several carriages, indicating the presence of a nearby train station, railroad crossing, or transportation network.\n\nOn the road surface, there are visible markings which aren't entirely clear but suggest lane demarcation or directional markings. To the left, a sign indicates a one-way street, instructing drivers not to enter that route. There are no visible pedestrians in the scene.\n\nDrivers at this intersection would need to be aware of the traffic lights, pay attention to the lane markings for proper navigation, observe road signage to reach their destination, and be mindful of railroad-related traffic if applicable. The white car in the right foreground of the image appears to be proceeding through the intersection on a green light."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
