The road structure includes at least two lanes for vehicles in the direction we are looking, with a separate lane for parked vehicles. There is a pedestrian crossing with zebra stripes at the traffic light intersection. Several high-rise buildings line the road, and there are shops at the street level.\n\nThere is a multitude of road signs visible:\n- The traffic signal directly in front is showing a red light for the direction we are facing, which means vehicles in this lane must stop.\n- Overhead, there are two speed limit signs, one indicating "60" and the other indicating "50," suggesting there may be varying speed limits at this section of the road or for different lanes.\n- A green sign includes directions to places, but the text is not entirely legible in the image.\n\nRegarding traffic and pedestrians:\n- Numerous cars are visible on the road, all of which are obeying the red light and have stopped appropriately.\n- On the other side of the intersection, a vehicle is making a right-hand turn.\n- There are two motorcycles (or possibly mopeds/scooters) parked by the side of the road, indicating this area may be designated for motorcycle parking.\n- One pedestrian is visible, waiting on the corner of the intersection where the traffic light is red, presumably waiting to cross the street.\n\nOther details to note as a driver include the clarity of the day, which is conducive to good visibility. The shadows suggest it might be earlier in the day, with the sun casting long shadows but still relatively high in the sky. Drivers should be aware of the red light, the speed limit, and the presence of pedestrians, and they should prepare to stop or proceed based on the traffic signals. Pedestrian right-of-way at the crosswalk should also be observed once the lights change.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
