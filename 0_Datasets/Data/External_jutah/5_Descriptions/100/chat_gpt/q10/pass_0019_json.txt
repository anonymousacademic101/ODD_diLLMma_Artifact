The sky is overcast, which suggests it might be either early morning or late afternoon, although the exact time of day cannot be ascertained.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a traffic signal with red lights illuminated, instructing vehicles facing the signal to stop. Additionally, there is a yellow sign above the leftmost lane indicating that the lane is for left turns only.\n\nRoadway and traffic details:\n- There are multiple traffic lanes, and the demarcations on the road are clearly visible.\n- Vehicles are stopped at the intersection in compliance with the traffic signal.\n- Road signs on the right-hand side of the image indicate the proximity to an on-ramp for Interstate 75, going both northbound and southbound.\n- There are no visible pedestrians in the immediate intersection, which means there is likely no pedestrian cross traffic at the moment the image was taken.\n\nOther details:\n- There is a building on the right corner of the intersection with boarded-up windows and a sign indicating that it is for sale.\n- Downtown high-rise buildings are visible in the background, suggesting this photo is taken near or in a city center.\n- There is a crane in the distance, which indicates ongoing construction or development in the cityscape.\n\nSafety and attention:\n- Drivers facing the traffic light should remain stopped until the lights change.\n- Given the wet roads, drivers should exercise caution and maintain a safe stopping distance from other vehicles to avoid skidding.\n- The intersection appears clear of pedestrians, but drivers should remain vigilant for any individuals who may enter the crosswalk.\n\nThe photo does not provide any other identifiable information that pertains to a specific time, event, or person.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
