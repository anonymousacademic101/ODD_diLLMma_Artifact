The sky is overcast, suggesting either recent rain or impending rain.\n\nThe road structure consists of multiple lanes with what seems to be a dedicated left-turn lane indicated by the arrow in the traffic signal above the road and the signage on the right corner of the image reading "LEFT LANE MUST TURN LEFT." The traffic lights for the straight-ahead lanes are showing a red signal, indicating that vehicles traveling straight or turning right must stop. There is also a pedestrian crossing signal box visible on the right side of the intersection, with a figure that is not illuminated, so it\'s not clear whether pedestrians are advised to wait or if they can cross.\n\nThere is no visible signage indicating a speed limit on this stretch directly visible in the photo, but there is a speed limit sign farther back on the right suggesting a 35 mph zone which might apply to the stretch of road approaching the intersection.\n\nSeveral vehicles are on the road, with one sedan in the foreground making a left turn, obeying the dedicated turn signal while the straight-ahead traffic light is red. Other vehicles are seen waiting at the red light, and more cars are visible traveling in the opposite direction where the traffic light appears to be green, as indicated by their movement and visible green signal in the distance.\n\nOn the building to the left of the image, you can see a faded sign saying "FOR LEASE," which suggests that the property is currently vacant and looking for tenants.\n\nThere are no visible pedestrians in the image, and the time of day is difficult to determine because overcast skies can make it seem earlier or later than it actually is, but the visibility and functioning traffic lights suggest it is not nighttime. The wet conditions indicate that drivers should be cautious to avoid hydroplaning and to account for potentially longer stopping distances. Overall, drivers and pedestrians should exercise care due to the wet road conditions and ensure adherence to traffic signals and road signage.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
