This image shows a street scene that appears to be taken during twilight or early evening, as the sky is dark but street lights are on. There are several elements to note:

1. Road Structure: The road is a multi-lane street with at least two lanes visible for the direction the photo is facing. There are also marked lanes and a dedicated left turn lane with a traffic signal arrow. It appears to be an urban setting, likely within a city given the presence of business signage and street lighting.

2. Traffic Signals: Multiple traffic signals are visible and illuminated green, indicating that traffic in the photo's viewpoint is allowed to proceed. There is also a pedestrian signal showing a red hand, indicating that pedestrians should not cross at this time.

3. Traffic: Vehicles are moving in both directions. The cars in the nearest lanes to the camera are facing towards the camera and have their headlights on, indicating they are moving away from the camera's point of view. There is some visible oncoming traffic as well.

4. Pedestrians: There is at least one visible pedestrian on the sidewalk who appears to be waiting to cross the street, obeying the pedestrian signal. 

5. Time of Day: Based on the lighting, it seems to be either dawn or dusk. Given the active streetlights and headlights on the cars, it is most likely early evening.

6. Road Signs: A street sign for "Las Vegas Blvd" and "Ogden" is visible, indicating the intersection. There's also a 'No U-Turn' sign for the traffic facing the camera.

7. Surroundings: There are illuminated signs for establishments such as a hotel named "OASIS", suggesting a commercial area with businesses that cater to both locals and visitors.

8. Other Considerations: Drivers should be attentive to the traffic signals, including the dedicated left turn signal, and be prepared for changes in the light cycle. They should also be mindful of pedestrians who might be crossing at another point when allowed.

Overall, this scene requires typical urban driving awareness, with attention to traffic signals, road signs, other vehicles, and pedestrians.
