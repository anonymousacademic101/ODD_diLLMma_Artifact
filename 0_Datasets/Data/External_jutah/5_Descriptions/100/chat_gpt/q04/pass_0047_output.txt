NO

The road shown in the image does not appear to be an intersection but rather a stretch of road running horizontally across the frame. This can be inferred from the orientation of vehicles which are aligned parallel to the bottom edge of the image, suggesting that the flow of traffic is lateral relative to the viewer's perspective. Additionally, there are no visible indications such as traffic lights or road markings that would denote an intersection directly within the field of view.
