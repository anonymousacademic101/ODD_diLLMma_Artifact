YES

The road runs horizontally across the image. The view appears to be taken from the center of the road looking straight ahead, and we can see lanes for traffic moving in both directions, stretching from the left to right edges of the photo. This perspective, along with visible lane markings and traffic signals, indicates that the road runs horizontally in the frame. An intersection would typically show another road crossing the road we are on, but that is not evident from the perspective shown.
