This can be determined by the presence of traffic signals facing multiple directions, pedestrian crossing markings that suggest a junction, and the street sign for "Delaware St," which indicates that a street is intersecting at this point. Additionally, the presence of vehicles parked and driving in a direction perpendicular to our viewpoint supports that this is an intersection and not a road running horizontally across the image.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
