This suggests that the road intersects with another road and that traffic is controlled at this point, allowing cars to turn or proceed straight depending on the signal. The perpendicular traffic lights and commercial signs also suggest the presence of a crossroad.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
