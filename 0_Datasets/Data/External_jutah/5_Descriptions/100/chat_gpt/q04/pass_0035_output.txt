YES

The image shows a road that runs horizontally across the frame, as indicated by the traffic flow and lane markings, which are parallel with the bottom edge of the photo. The presence of a crosswalk also supports that the road extends from one side to the other horizontally in the image. An intersection would typically exhibit multiple converging roads, which is not clearly presented in this view.
