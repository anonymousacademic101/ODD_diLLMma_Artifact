This can be determined as the vehicles are aligned parallel to the bottom edge of the photo, indicating the road's orientation is left-to-right within the viewpoint of the image, which corresponds to a horizontal direction in the context of the image's composition. The perspective of the buildings, vehicles, and the road itself all align with the horizontal orientation.
