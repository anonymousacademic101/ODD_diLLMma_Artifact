NO

The road does not run horizontally across the image. Instead, it appears to curve to the right, indicating that the road we are driving on may be part of an exit ramp or a curved road leading to another direction rather than a straight horizontal path. The road does not show a typical intersection layout with cross traffic within the field of view depicted in the photograph.
