YES

The road we are driving on runs horizontally across the image. This can be determined by the orientation of the vehicles, road markings, and the perspective of the buildings, which are aligned parallel to the road, indicating a horizontal path from the viewpoint of the camera. There is no visible intersection immediately in the frame that would indicate a crossing road.
