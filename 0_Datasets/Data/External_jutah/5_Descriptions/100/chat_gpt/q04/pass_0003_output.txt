YES

The road we are driving on runs horizontally across the image from the perspective of the photo. We can tell this because the lanes and cars are aligned in a direction that goes from the left side of the image to the right side. The intersection is the area where this horizontal road intersects with a road running perpendicular to it, which can be inferred from the presence of traffic lights controlling the flow from multiple directions.
