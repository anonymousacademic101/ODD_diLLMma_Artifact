YES

The road we are seeing is part of an intersection, as indicated by the crosswalks, traffic signals, and the perpendicular traffic stopped or moving through the intersection from the other road that intersects with the one we are "on." The image also shows cars aligned in a manner that suggests they are stopping for or moving through the intersection. The road does indeed run horizontally across the image from this vantage point.
