YES

The road shown in the image appears to be an intersection rather than running horizontally. The road we are on seems to connect with another road that runs perpendicular to it, creating an intersection. The giveaway is the presence of a stop sign to the right side of the road ahead, implying the presence of a junction where different roads meet, and the faded road markings indicating a place to stop before crossing or turning onto the intersecting road.
