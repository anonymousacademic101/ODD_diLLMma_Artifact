The cars are facing us, suggesting that the lanes they are in run perpendicular to our point of view, and the way the traffic cones are arranged indicates that they are being used to direct or block traffic at this intersection. The perspective of the road itself as it appears to narrow toward the center of the image is consistent with looking across an intersection rather than down a straight road that runs horizontally across the image.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
