YES

The road in the image runs horizontally across from the perspective of the viewpoint. We can confirm this by observing the traffic signals, lane markings, and the "One Way" and "Do Not Enter" signs which indicate the direction of the traffic flow on the road ahead. The road is not an intersection that we're driving on; it's the continuation of a horizontal road that we would be crossing if we were permitted to go straight. However, the "Do Not Enter" signs and the red traffic light indicate that we should not drive straight ahead.
