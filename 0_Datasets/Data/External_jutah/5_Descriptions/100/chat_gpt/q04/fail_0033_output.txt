The road runs horizontally across the image. This can be determined by observing the lanes of traffic, the crosswalks, traffic signals, and general orientation of the vehicles, which all align with a horizontal roadway configuration rather than an intersecting one. The vehicles are positioned parallel to the bottom edge of the image, indicating that the road on which they are driving is horizontal in the frame of the image.
