NO.

The road in the image does not appear to be an intersection; it seems to be a multi-lane road running horizontally across the image with traffic flowing in the same direction, which is indicated by lane markings and the direction the vehicles are facing. There is no clear indication of intersecting traffic flows or traffic signals that would typically characterize an intersection.
