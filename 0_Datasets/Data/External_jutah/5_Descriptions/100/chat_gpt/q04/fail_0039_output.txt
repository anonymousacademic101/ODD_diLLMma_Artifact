YES

We are driving on an intersection. The explanation for this is that there are traffic lights present, with some lights facing us showing red, indicating that traffic crossing our path would be intersecting from the sides. This configuration is typical for controlling traffic at intersections. Additionally, there are visible lane markings that hint at the roads crossing each other, and a street sign is visible to the left which often marks street corners. The presence of a direction sign for an interstate or highway indicates that the road continues on but also intersects with other roads or on-ramps.
