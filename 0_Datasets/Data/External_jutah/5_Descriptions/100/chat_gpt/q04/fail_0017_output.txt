YES

The road that is visible in the image runs horizontally across the frame. This is indicated by the direction of the vehicles on the road, the orientation of the traffic signals, and the crosswalks that show the road intersects with another. Additionally, the light rail or tram on the elevated track to the left also moves in a direction perpendicular to the road below, which means the road below runs horizontally in relation to the image.
