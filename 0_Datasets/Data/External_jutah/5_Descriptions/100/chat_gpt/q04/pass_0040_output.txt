YES

The road runs horizontally across the image. The perspective of the photo, taken from the driver's point of view, shows the lanes of the road stretching horizontally across the frame from the left to the right side. The vehicles and street elements are aligned in a manner that suggests the road runs parallel to the bottom edge of the image, which indicates the road's horizontal orientation. There is no visible intersection that disrupts this horizontal flow within the visible portion of the image.
