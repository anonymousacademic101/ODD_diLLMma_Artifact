YES

The road on which the viewer seems to be driving intersects with another road, creating an intersection. This can be inferred by the presence of traffic lights, road markings for pedestrian crossings, and crosswalk signals, indicating the crossing of one road with another. Additionally, there are cars positioned in a way that suggests they are either moving across the viewer's path or waiting to do so, confirming that this is an intersection. The road does not run horizontally across the image in the context of the viewerâ€™s perspective; it intersects with the road ahead, as is typical for an intersection.
