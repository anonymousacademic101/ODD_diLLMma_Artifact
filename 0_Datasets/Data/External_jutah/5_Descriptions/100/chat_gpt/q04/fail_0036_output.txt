YES

Although the image has been taken from a straight perspective down a road, the question seems to be about the orientation of the road in relation to the image frame, not about the intersection ahead. The road runs horizontally across the image because the perspective of the shot is taken in such a way that the road extends from the left to the right edge of the photo, creating a horizontal visual line across the image.
