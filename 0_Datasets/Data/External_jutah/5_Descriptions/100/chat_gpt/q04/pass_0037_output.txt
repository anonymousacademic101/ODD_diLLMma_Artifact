The road runs horizontally across the image. This can be determined by the orientation of the vehicles which appear to be aligned in a typical traffic pattern on a straight roadway. The cars' headlights and taillights all face in directions that are perpendicular to the sides of the image, suggesting that the road is horizontal in the frame of the photo.
