The vehicles are arranged in a line that suggests we are viewing the side profile of the road rather than a road leading away from us, which would be typical of an intersection view from within a vehicle. The horizontal orientation of the road can also be inferred from the way the traffic lights and signs are set up, as they are visible from the sides and oriented for traffic that is moving perpendicular to our viewpoint.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
