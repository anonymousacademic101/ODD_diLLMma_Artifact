YES

The road we are viewing in the image runs horizontally across the image from the perspective of the observer. There is a clear STOP sign along with road markings that indicate a place to stop and give way to traffic that may be traversing perpendicularly. Additionally, the horizontal road features such as the lane dividers and the shoulder lines support the orientation being horizontal across the frame. The orientation of the "ONE WAY" and "NORTH 93" signs also suggests that the cross-traffic direction is from left to right, making the road we're looking at part of an intersection where we would be entering or crossing the through road.
