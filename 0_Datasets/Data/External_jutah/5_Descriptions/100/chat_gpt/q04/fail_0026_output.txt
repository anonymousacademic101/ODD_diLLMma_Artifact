The road appears to be running horizontally across the image. The perspective shows vehicles arranged in a manner that suggests they are traveling on a path that extends from the left to the right side of the frame, indicating a horizontal orientation of the road in the image. The positioning of the traffic lights and the layout of the space around the monument also support this observation.
