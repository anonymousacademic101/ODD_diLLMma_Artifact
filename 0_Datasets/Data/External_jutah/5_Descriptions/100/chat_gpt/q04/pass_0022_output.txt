YES

We are at an intersection. The traffic light visible ahead, the crosswalk markings on the pavement, and the presence of a perpendicular street to the left indicate that this is an intersection. Additionally, the arrangement of the parked cars and the direction of the moving vehicles further confirm this. The road we are on intersects with another road that runs horizontally across the image from left to right.
