YES

The road runs horizontally across the image. You can tell because the lanes are parallel to the bottom edge of the image, and the vehicles are arranged in a way that suggests they are following a path that extends from the left side of the image to the right side. Additionally, the road markings, including pedestrian crosswalk lines and vehicle stop lines at the traffic lights, are oriented perpendicular to the direction of the lanes, indicating that the road's primary direction of travel is horizontal relative to the image's perspective.
