YES

The road we are driving on runs horizontally across the image. This is indicated by the orientation of the parked cars, the crosswalk markings on the road, and the direction the vehicles in the image are facing. The presence of traffic lights and the perpendicular crosswalk suggest that the vehicle is waiting at an intersection, with the road continuing across the image from left to right.
