YES

Explanation: The road we are driving on runs horizontally across the image. This can be inferred from the orientation of the traffic lights, vehicles, and road signs which are aligned parallel to the bottom of the image, indicating the road extends from the left to the right side horizontally. An intersection would imply additional roads crossing, and while there are intersecting streets (as suggested by the perpendicular traffic lights for cross traffic), the road we are focused on itself runs horizontally in the image's perspective.
