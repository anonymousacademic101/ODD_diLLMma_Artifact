YES.

The road runs horizontally across the image. This can be inferred from the direction that the vehicles are oriented in the parking lot on the right side of the image—parallel to the road—indicating that the road itself runs alongside the parking lot. Additionally, the line of traffic cones creates a visual barrier along the same horizontal path, reinforcing the direction of the road. The absence of any visible traffic signals or signage that would typically indicate an intersection further supports this observation.
