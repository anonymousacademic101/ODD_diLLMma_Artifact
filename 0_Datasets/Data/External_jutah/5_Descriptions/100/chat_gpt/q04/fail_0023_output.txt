NO.

The road in the image is not an intersection, nor does it run horizontally across the image. From what is visible, it seems to be a parking lot with multiple empty spaces, indicated by the faded parking lines and the layout of the parked vehicles. There is no clear indication of a road intersecting or a horizontal road in the frame; the picture is of a relatively open area with parked cars and a lighthouse in the background.
