YES

The road appears to run horizontally across the image. The orientation of the traffic signals and the placement of the pedestrian and statue suggest that the vantage point is looking across the street rather than down it. The positioning of the traffic light also implies that the road in view intersects with the road the observer is on, since the traffic light faces across the road rather than along it. Additionally, the "NO TURN ON RED" sign also indicates the presence of an intersection where turning is regulated.
