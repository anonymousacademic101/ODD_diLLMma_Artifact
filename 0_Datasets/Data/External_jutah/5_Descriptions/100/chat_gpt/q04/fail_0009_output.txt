The road runs horizontally across the image. There are no visible signs of it being an intersection, such as crossing traffic lanes, traffic lights, or road markings that would indicate intersecting traffic flows. The image presents a single, continuous stretch of road extending from one side of the frame to the other without any indication of it crossing another road.
