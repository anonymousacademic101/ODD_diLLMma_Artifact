The traffic signals are directly in the line of sight for the vehicles, suggesting they control traffic moving in the direction the camera is facing. Moreover, there are visible lane markings and crosswalk lines that are typical features of an intersection. The orientation of the vehicles and the layout of the road infrastructure support the conclusion that this scene is at an intersection, not a road running horizontally across the image.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
