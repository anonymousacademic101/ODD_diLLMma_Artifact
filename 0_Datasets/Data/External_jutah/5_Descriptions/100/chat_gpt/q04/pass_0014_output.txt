YES

The road we are observing in this image runs horizontally across the frame. This can be determined as the vehicles are aligned parallel to the bottom edge of the photo, indicating the road's orientation is left-to-right within the viewpoint of the image, which corresponds to a horizontal direction in the context of the image's composition. The perspective of the buildings, vehicles, and the road itself all align with the horizontal orientation. There is also no clear indication of an intersection in the immediate viewpoint.
