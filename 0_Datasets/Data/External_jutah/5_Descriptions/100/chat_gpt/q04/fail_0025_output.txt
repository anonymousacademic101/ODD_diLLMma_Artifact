YES

The road is at an intersection. The presence of traffic signals, road markings that indicate crossing traffic, and visible perpendicular lanes on the right side of the picture suggest that this is an area where two or more roads intersect. Additionally, the cars are positioned as if they are waiting for a light to change to proceed through the intersection, and turn lanes are indicated by arrows on the traffic lights.
