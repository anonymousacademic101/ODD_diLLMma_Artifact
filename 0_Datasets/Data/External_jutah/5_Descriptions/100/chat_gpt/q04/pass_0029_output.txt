YES

The road we are driving on appears to be at an intersection because there are traffic lights directly ahead and multiple lanes are visible, which include dedicated turning lanes (indicated by the lane markings and arrows on the road). This suggests that the road intersects with another road and that traffic is controlled at this point, allowing cars to turn or proceed straight depending on the signal. The perpendicular traffic lights and commercial signs also suggest the presence of a crossroad.
