YES

The road we are driving on is an intersection. This can be determined by the presence of traffic signals facing multiple directions, pedestrian crossing markings that suggest a junction, and the street sign for "Delaware St," which indicates that a street is intersecting at this point. Additionally, the presence of vehicles parked and driving in a direction perpendicular to our viewpoint supports that this is an intersection and not a road running horizontally across the image.
