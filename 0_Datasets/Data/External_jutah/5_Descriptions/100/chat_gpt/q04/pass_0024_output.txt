NO.

The road you are driving on runs horizontally across the image. It is a multi-lane highway that extends from the foreground to the background of the photo, as indicated by the direction of the cars and the placement of the road markings and signs. The road is not depicted as intersecting with another road within the frame of the image, although there are signs indicating exits and possibly an intersection or interchange nearby. The road infrastructure above and to the side suggests complex interchanges, but the road captured in this image itself is running horizontally.
