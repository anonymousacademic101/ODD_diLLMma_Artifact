The road runs horizontally across the image from the perspective of the image's composition. The lanes appear to be parallel to the bottom edge of the photo, creating a horizontal direction from left to right as viewed in the image. There are no visible signs of an intersection within the visible frame of the photo, suggesting the road continues in this horizontal fashion through the tunnel.
