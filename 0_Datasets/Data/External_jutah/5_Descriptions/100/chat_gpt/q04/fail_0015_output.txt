YES

The road runs horizontally across the image as we can see the flow of traffic is moving left and right in the photograph. The presence of horizontal traffic signals also suggests that the traffic on the road we are on moves perpendicular to the angle of view of the image. Moreover, there is a "ONE WAY" sign pointing to the left, indicating that the direction of traffic on this side of the road is towards the left side of the photograph.
