NO

The road does not run horizontally across the image; instead, it extends into the distance from the bottom to the top of the image, indicating that we are driving along the road, not observing it from a perpendicular angle that would make it appear horizontal across the frame. There is no intersection visible in the portion of the road we can see. It appears to be a straightforward street with traffic lights and multiple lanes, running in a vertical direction in the image plane.
