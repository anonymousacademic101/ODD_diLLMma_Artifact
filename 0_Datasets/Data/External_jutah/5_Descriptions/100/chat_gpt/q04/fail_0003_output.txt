YES

The road runs horizontally across the image. This can be determined by observing the position of the car, which is oriented parallel to the bottom edge of the photo, indicating that the road upon which it is driving extends from one side of the image to the other in a horizontal manner. Additionally, the crosswalk lines are perpendicular to the car's direction, suggesting a standard intersection where roads cross each other horizontally and vertically with respect to the image frame.
