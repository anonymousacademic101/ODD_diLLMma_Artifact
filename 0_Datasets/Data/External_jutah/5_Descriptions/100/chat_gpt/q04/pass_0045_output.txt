NO.

The image does not provide a clear overhead or angled view that would allow us to ascertain the layout of the intersection with absolute certainty. However, the framing of the photo shows vehicles lined up and facing forward, which suggests we are situated on a road segment rather than an intersection. Road markings typically present at intersections, such as crosswalks or stop lines, are not visible in the foreground. The vehicles' orientation and the absence of any obvious sign of cross traffic suggest that the road runs horizontally across the image from the camera's perspective.
