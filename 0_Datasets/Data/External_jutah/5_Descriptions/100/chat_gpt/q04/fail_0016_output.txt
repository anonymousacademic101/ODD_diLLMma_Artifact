YES

We are at an intersection. The visible traffic lights and crosswalks, as well as the orientation of the vehicles and signage, indicate that this is a place where two or more roads cross each other. The sign pointing to "Woodward" also suggests multiple directions for traffic flow, typical of an intersection. Additionally, the road markings indicate turning lanes, which are common at intersections.
