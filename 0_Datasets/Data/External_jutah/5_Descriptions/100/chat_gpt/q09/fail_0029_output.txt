The composition of the photo with the street visibly ascending towards the buildings in the background suggests that the road is inclined. The elevation change is especially noticeable as the street goes up from the intersection, which indicates a hilly terrain. Additionally, the street sign indicates "Hill St," which might imply the road is characteristically hilly.
