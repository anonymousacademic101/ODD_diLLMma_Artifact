Based on the image provided, it appears that the road is flat rather than hilly. The visible sections of the road do not show any significant inclines or declines that would indicate a hilly terrain. The perspective of the road, railway crossing, and the surrounding infrastructure, such as traffic lights and signs, all suggest a level road.
