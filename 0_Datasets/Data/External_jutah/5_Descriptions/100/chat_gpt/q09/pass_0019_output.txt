NO.

The road visible in the image is not hilly; it appears to be relatively flat, especially in the immediate vicinity. The horizontal orientation of the traffic lights, the straightness of the lane dividers, and the vehicles all suggest a lack of incline. The landscape does not indicate any significant rises or drops in elevation in the area captured by the photo.
