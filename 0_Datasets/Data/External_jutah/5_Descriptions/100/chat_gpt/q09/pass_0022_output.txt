In the image, the road appears quite flat and there is no visible indication of it being hilly ahead. The buildings on either side are vertical and there are no inclined angles apparent in the road itself that would suggest any significant hills. The vehicles and pedestrians are all oriented in a manner consistent with flat terrain.
