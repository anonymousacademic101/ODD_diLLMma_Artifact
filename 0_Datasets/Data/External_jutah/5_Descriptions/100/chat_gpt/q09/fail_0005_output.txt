YES.

The roadway in the image is winding along the contour of the hills or mountains it is adjacent to, which indicates that the general terrain is hilly even if the immediate stretch of road appears fairly level. There are elevation changes visible on the landscape, and the road likely features varying inclines and declines along its length due to the hilly terrain it traverses.
