It is not possible to definitively determine whether the road is hilly based solely on this image, as it shows a road scene with vehicles stopped or moving slowly, likely in traffic, and does not provide a clear view of the road's gradient or topography. The surroundings are primarily urban and flat in the immediate view, with no visible indication of hills.
