The road in the image appears to be relatively flat rather than hilly. There are no significant inclines or slopes visible in the segment of the road shown in the photograph. The street is running level through an urban area with buildings on either side, suggesting it is designed for regular city traffic, which is typically on flatter terrain for accessibility and ease of navigation.
