YES

While the specific road depicted in the image appears relatively flat for the immediately visible stretch, the observable layout of the city skyline and structures like the rising or descending profiles of buildings and streets in the background suggest a sloping terrain, albeit not very steep within the frame. This indicates that while this section of the road may be flat, it is located in an area with hilly features. Additionally, a hilly road does not need to have a constant slope; it can have flat sections as well. Therefore, considering the broader context of the area shown, it would not be incorrect to describe the road network as potentially hilly.
