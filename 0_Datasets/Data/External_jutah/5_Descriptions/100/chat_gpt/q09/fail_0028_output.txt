The question seems to be asking about the immediate road that the viewer is on or about to enter, rather than the surrounding landscape. From the perspective visible in the image, the immediate road surface appears to be flat at the intersection shown, with no immediate hills visible on the road itself. There are hilly or mountainous landscapes in the background, but they are not part of the road we are driving on.
