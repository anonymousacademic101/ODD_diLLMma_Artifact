NO

The road in the image appears relatively flat and straight, with no visible inclines or declines that would indicate it is hilly. The overpasses and ramps in the distance are elevated structures, but they are not part of the road we are driving on. The immediate road ahead does not show any characteristics of a hilly terrain.
