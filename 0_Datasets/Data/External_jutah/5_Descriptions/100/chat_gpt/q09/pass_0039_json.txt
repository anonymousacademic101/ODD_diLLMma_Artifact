This indicates that while this section of the road may be flat, it is located in an area with hilly features. Additionally, a hilly road does not need to have a constant slope; it can have flat sections as well. Therefore, considering the broader context of the area shown, it would not be incorrect to describe the road network as potentially hilly.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
