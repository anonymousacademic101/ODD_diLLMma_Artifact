NO.

The image shows a city street that appears level rather than hilly. The vehicles and pedestrians are oriented on a flat surface, and there are no visible inclines or declines in the road within the view of the photo. The horizontal lines of the buildings and crosswalks also suggest that this particular section of the road is not hilly.
