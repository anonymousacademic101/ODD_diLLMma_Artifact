NO.

The road in the image appears to be relatively flat; there are no visible inclines or declines that would indicate a hilly terrain. The skyline is level, and buildings on both sides of the road rise vertically without any slant that would suggest a slope. The vehicles also appear to be on level ground, with no tilt indicating they are going uphill or downhill.
