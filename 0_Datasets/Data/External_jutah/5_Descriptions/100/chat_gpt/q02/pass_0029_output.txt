NO.

The road in the image appears to be straight in the immediate viewpoint, showing multiple lanes of traffic stopped at a signal-controlled intersection. There are no visual indicators of a sharp curve just ahead in the road visible in the image. A sharp curve would typically be indicated by road signs, a visible bend in the road, or other traffic markings signaling a change in direction, none of which are present here.
