NO.

The road visible in the image is not a sharp curve; it appears to be a straight section leading to an intersection, as indicated by the visible traffic signals and street layout. The lanes are clearly marked, and the vehicles are aligned in a manner consistent with straight road traffic. The perspective of the image also shows a flat and direct road path rather than a sharp curve.
