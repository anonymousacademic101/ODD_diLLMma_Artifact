The road in the image appears to be fairly straight with a gentle curve to the left in the distance, not a sharp curve. The lanes and traffic are aligned in a manner that suggests a mild curvature rather than a sharp turn. Sharp curves are typically characterized by a more abrupt change in direction which is not evident here.
