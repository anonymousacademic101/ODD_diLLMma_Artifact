NO.

The road visible in the image is not showing a sharp curve; it appears to be a straight line of traffic with normal intersection traffic controls and lane markings. There is a "left turn only" lane indicated by the road signs, but this pertains to an intersection, not to the road itself being on a sharp curve.
