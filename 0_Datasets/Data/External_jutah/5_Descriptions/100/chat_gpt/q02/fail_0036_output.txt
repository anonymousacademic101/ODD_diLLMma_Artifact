The road in the image appears to be relatively straight with a slight curve in the distance that does not qualify as sharp. The view shows a city street with multiple lanes, traffic signals, parked cars, and buildings lining both sides. The curve ahead seems to be gentle and within normal limits for an urban road, not presenting the kind of acute angle or tight bend that would be characterized as a "sharp curve."
