NO.

The road in the image appears to be quite straight with a gentle curve to the right observable at the far end, which does not meet the criteria for a "sharp" curve. Sharp curves are typically characterized by abrupt changes in direction that require significant steering adjustments when driving. The curve in this picture is rather subtle.
