NO.

The question is phrased as if the observer is currently driving on a road, but since the provided context is an image, it's not accurate to imply that there is any actual driving taking place. The image shows a street intersection from a stationary perspective, with no apparent sharp curves on the visible roadway. The road ahead does curve gently to the left, but it does not appear to be a "sharp" curve according to the image.
