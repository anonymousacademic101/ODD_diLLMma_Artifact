NO.

The road ahead appears to make a gentle curve to the right rather than a sharp one, as indicated by the lane markings and the trajectory of the road as seen through the windshield. Sharp curves typically require signs warning of a sharp turn ahead, but none are visible here, and the curvature of the road seems gradual, not abrupt.
