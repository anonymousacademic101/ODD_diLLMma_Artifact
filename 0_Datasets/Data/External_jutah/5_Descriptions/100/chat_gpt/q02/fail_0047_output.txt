NO.

The road in the image seems to be leading into a normal intersection rather than a sharp curve. This can be inferred from the presence of crosswalk lines, traffic signals, and vehicles positioned to move straight ahead or turn at the intersection. Sharp curves typically do not have these features and are characterized by continuous bending of the road, which is not visible here.
