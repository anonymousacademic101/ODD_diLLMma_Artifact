NO

In the image provided, the road ahead does not show a sharp curve; rather, it appears to continue straight beyond the intersection. There are lane markings indicating lanes going straight, and there's a traffic light controlling a straight-through intersection. While there is a "LEFT TURN ONLY" sign for a lane that is designated for left-turning vehicles, this does not indicate a sharp curve for through traffic.
