NO

The road shown in the image does not appear to be a sharp curve. The visible road markings and context suggest it is an intersection, not a curve. The road extends straight ahead beyond the crosswalk. The presence of traffic lights, a pedestrian crossing sign, and a car stopped at the intersection support this observation. The yellow road sign showing a curve is indicative of a warning for a curve ahead, not the current position on a sharp curve.
