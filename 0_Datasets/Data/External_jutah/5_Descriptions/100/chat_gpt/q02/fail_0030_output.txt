The image shows an intersection with what appear to be a gentle turn or a standard street corner rather than a sharp curve. There's no evidence of a road that continues in a sharp curving manner; it's a typical urban street setup with a corner that vehicles can navigate without the need for any significant steering adjustment like one would expect on a sharp curve.
