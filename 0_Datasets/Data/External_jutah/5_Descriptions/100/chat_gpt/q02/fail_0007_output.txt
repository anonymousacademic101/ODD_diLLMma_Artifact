NO.

The image shows a straight section of the road at an intersection, and there are no visible sharp curves in the immediate vicinity. The road appears to continue straight ahead beyond the intersection, and while the road on the right side is blocked with cones and a "Road Closed" sign indicating construction or a detour, it does not show a sharp curve where we are driving.
