NO.

The road ahead appears to lead to a T-intersection rather than having a sharp curve. The road signage indicates a "DO NOT ENTER" sign to the right, and there is also a "WRONG WAY" sign, suggesting that the road directly ahead is a one-way street but in the opposite direction of the viewer's perspective. Therefore, we are not on a sharp curve as the road does not continue in the direction we are facing; instead, it requires a turn either to the left or the right at the intersection.
