The road ahead does not immediately appear to be on a sharp curve. The visible traffic signs indicate a left turn at the intersection rather than a sharp curve. The straight alignment of the vehicles waiting at the intersection suggests that the road itself is not curving sharply at this point but rather intersecting with another road where a left turn is possible.
