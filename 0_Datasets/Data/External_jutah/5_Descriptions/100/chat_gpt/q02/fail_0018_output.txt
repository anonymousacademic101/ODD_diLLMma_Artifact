The image shows a street scene with vehicles parked on the side and a parking building. There is no evidence in the image that suggests we are on a road, let alone driving on a sharp curve. The view of the street is relatively straight, and the flow of traffic is not visible. The cars are parked or stopped, and the road markings do not indicate a curve ahead.
