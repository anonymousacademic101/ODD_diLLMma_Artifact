NO.

The road does not appear to be an on-off ramp typical of a highway or freeway. It lacks the features of such ramps like signage indicating entrance or exit to a highway, acceleration or deceleration lanes, or the proximity to a larger road. The environment looks more rural or semi-rural, and the road seems to be a standard local road or a service road given its appearance, the surrounding greenery, agricultural fields, and the absence of roadway infrastructure for high-speed traffic.
