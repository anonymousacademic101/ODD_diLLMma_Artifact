NO

The road in the image does not appear to be an on-off ramp. It looks more like a street in an urban area with multiple lanes, parked cars along the sides, buildings close to the street, and no immediate signs of being a highway ramp. On-off ramps typically have different characteristics such as being connected to a highway, no parked cars, and often curving or sloping to merge into highways.
