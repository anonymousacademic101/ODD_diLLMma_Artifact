We are not on an on-off ramp. The image shows multiple lanes of vehicles stopped at what appears to be a signalized intersection in an urban setting with buildings on either side of the road, which is indicative of a regular city street rather than an on-off ramp, which typically connects highways with local roads and wouldn't have crosswalks and dense urban development directly adjacent to it.
