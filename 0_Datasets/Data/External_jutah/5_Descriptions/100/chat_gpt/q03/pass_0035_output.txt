NO.

The road in the image does not appear to be an on-off ramp. It looks more like a city street, as evidenced by features like pedestrian walkways, traffic signals, large planters, city buildings in close proximity, and a general urban environment. On-off ramps typically connect highways to local roads and do not have features such as crosswalks and traffic signals at such short distances.
