NO.

The image shows a wet city road with multiple lanes and road markings indicating traffic flow directions. There are no signs or road features typical for an on-off ramp, such as tighter curves or merging lanes. Instead, the road appears to be a typical urban street with traffic signals and intersections. On-off ramps are usually associated with highways and have a more distinct design to facilitate the joining or leaving of high-speed traffic, which is not apparent in this image.
