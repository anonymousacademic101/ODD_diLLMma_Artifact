The road in the image appears to be a regular city street rather than an on-off ramp. There are storefronts, pedestrian crosswalks, traffic signals, and planters in the median, all of which are characteristic of urban streets rather than the more functional design of highway access ramps. Additionally, there's a sign stating "ROAD CLOSED" indicating construction ahead, which isn't a typical feature of an on-off ramp.
