There are storefronts, pedestrian infrastructure, traffic lights, and a clearly urban environment, which all indicate that this is a regular street and not a ramp designed for freeway access or egress. On-off ramps typically don't have direct storefront access and are more focused on connecting local roads with higher-speed motorways or highways."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
