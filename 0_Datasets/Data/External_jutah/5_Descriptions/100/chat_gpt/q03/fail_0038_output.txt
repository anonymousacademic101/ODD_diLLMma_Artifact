NO.

The road in the image does not appear to be an on-off ramp typically associated with highways or interstates. It appears to be a regular street intersection with a median and a roundabout feature. The "ONE WAY" sign indicates traffic direction rather than the entrance or exit of a highway. Additionally, the residential buildings, the presence of pedestrians, and the calm traffic flow suggest this is a local street, not a highway ramp.
