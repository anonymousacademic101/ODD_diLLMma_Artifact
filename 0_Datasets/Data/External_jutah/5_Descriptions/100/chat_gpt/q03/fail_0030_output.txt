The road in the image seems to be a regular city street intersection rather than an on-off ramp. On-off ramps are typically associated with highways or expressways and are designed to enable vehicles to enter or exit such roads. In contrast, the street shown has pedestrian crossings, traffic signals, and buildings close to the sidewalk, which are standard features of urban roadways.
