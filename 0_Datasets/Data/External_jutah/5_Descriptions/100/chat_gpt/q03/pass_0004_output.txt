The road in the image appears to be a regular city street and not an on-off ramp. There are multiple lanes for traffic, traffic signals, a pedestrian crossing, and storefronts along the side of the road, all of which are typical features of urban streets rather than highway ramps, which typically connect highways to local roads and do not have traffic signals directly on them.
