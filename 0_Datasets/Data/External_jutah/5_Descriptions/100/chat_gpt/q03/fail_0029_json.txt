These are characteristics of a regular city road rather than an on-off ramp, which typically connects highways to local roads and wouldn't have traffic signals and pedestrian crossings directly on it. On-off ramps are usually designed for the purpose of entering or exiting a freeway and would not have the dense urban infrastructure seen here."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
