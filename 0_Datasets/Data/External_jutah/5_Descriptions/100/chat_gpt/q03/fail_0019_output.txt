The image shows a signalized intersection with multiple lanes and traffic lights. The presence of a crosswalk, a building directly on the corner of the intersection, and regular traffic lights suggests that this is not an on-off ramp, which typically connects highways to local roads and would not have such features. The sign indicating a left turn only further supports that this is a standard road intersection and not an on-off ramp.
