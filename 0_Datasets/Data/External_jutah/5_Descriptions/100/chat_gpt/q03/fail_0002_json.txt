There are also buildings and a hotel entrance directly adjacent to the road, which are not typically found on highway on-off ramps. The presence of streetlights and the design of the intersection also suggest that it is not an on-off ramp, which would usually connect highways to local roads and not feature direct hotel access or pedestrian crosswalks.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
