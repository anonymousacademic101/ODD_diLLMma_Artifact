NO.

The road does not appear to be an on-off ramp but rather a surface street or boulevard with multiple lanes, and signage indicating directions to other roads or highways. The signage overhead is directing traffic to West 826 and North A1A, suggesting that this road intersects with those routes but is not itself an on-off ramp. The presence of buildings, palm trees, and pedestrian areas immediately adjacent to the road also suggests it is an urban roadway, not a limited access highway on-off ramp.
