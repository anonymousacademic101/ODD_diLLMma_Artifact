On-off ramps are typically single-lane roads that serve as connectors between freeways/highways and local roads. In the image, there are several lanes of traffic, and there is no clear indication of an exit or entrance point that would signify an on-off ramp. Instead, vehicles are moving in parallel on a road designed for high-speed travel, characteristic of a main thoroughfare rather than an access ramp.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
