It appears to be an urban street with multiple lanes, buildings alongside, pedestrian pathways, and traffic signals. On-off ramps typically connect highways to local roads or other highways and do not feature the same urban infrastructure like street-side buildings and traffic lights controlled pedestrian crossings as seen in this image. Additionally, the presence of tram tracks on the road suggests that this is a regular city street used for various types of transportation, including trams, which would not be found on a highway on-off ramp.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
