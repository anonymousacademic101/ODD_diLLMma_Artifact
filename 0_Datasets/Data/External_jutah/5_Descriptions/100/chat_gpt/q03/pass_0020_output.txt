NO

The road in the image appears to be a neglected and deteriorated street, not an on-off ramp. There are several indicators that this is not an on-off ramp: the road condition is poor, there are no lines marking lanes, the surrounding environment is overgrown with vegetation, and there are old industrial buildings adjacent to the road, which is not typical for highway ramps designed for entering or exiting highways. On-off ramps also generally have clear signage, which is lacking here.
