NO.

The image shows multiple lanes of traffic with vehicles clearly stopped and waiting, possibly at a traffic light or in heavy congestion. On-off ramps typically do not have such dense traffic at a standstill unless there is a traffic jam specifically on the ramp or the highway to which the ramp connects. Furthermore, the presence of buildings close to the road and the overall urban setting with visible signage suggests this is an urban street rather than an on-off ramp, which typically connects highways to local roads and is less likely to be surrounded by such dense infrastructure.
