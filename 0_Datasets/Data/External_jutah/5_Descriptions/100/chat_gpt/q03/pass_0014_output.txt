NO.

The road in the image appears to be an urban street rather than an on-off ramp. There are buildings directly adjacent to the road, pedestrians walking, street lights, and other features commonly found in city or town streets. On-off ramps are typically associated with highways or freeways and are designed to allow vehicles to enter or exit at higher speeds, which doesn't match the characteristics of the road in this image.
