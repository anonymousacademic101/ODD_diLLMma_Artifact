NO.

The image shows a tree-lined street with multiple lanes and a crosswalk, which is indicative of a regular city street rather than an on-off ramp. There are also buildings and a hotel entrance directly adjacent to the road, which are not typically found on highway on-off ramps. The presence of streetlights and the design of the intersection also suggest that it is not an on-off ramp, which would usually connect highways to local roads and not feature direct hotel access or pedestrian crosswalks.
