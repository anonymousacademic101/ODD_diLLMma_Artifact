NO

The road in the image does not appear to be an on-off ramp. It looks to be an urban street with multiple lanes, pedestrian crossings, and adjacent buildings typical of a city environment. On-off ramps are usually connected to highways or expressways and don't have pedestrian crossings or traffic lights as seen here.
