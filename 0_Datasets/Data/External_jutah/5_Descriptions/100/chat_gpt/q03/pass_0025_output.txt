NO.

The road in the image appears to be a main thoroughfare or a highway, not an on-off ramp. We can infer this because there are multiple lanes of traffic in both directions and the flow of traffic suggests it is a main route with a separation barrier between the opposite directions, which is typical of highways. Additionally, there are no visible signs indicating an exit or entrance to the highway, which would be present if it were an on-off ramp.
