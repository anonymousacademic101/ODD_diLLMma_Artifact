NO.

The image depicts an urban street scene with multiple lanes, traffic signals, a pedestrian crossing, and buildings close to the roadside. These are characteristics of a regular city road rather than an on-off ramp, which typically connects highways to local roads and wouldn't have traffic signals and pedestrian crossings directly on it. On-off ramps are usually designed for the purpose of entering or exiting a freeway and would not have the dense urban infrastructure seen here.
