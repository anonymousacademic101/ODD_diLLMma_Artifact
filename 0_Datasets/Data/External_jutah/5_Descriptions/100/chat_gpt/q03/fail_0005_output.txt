This does not appear to be an on-off ramp. The road is a multi-lane highway with a dividing line and no visible signage or indication that it is an access ramp to another road. On-off ramps typically are single lanes designed for transitioning between roadways and have much more pronounced curves, yield or merge signs, and other distinctive features that are not present in this image.
