It looks like a city street with multiple lanes and traffic signals, which is typical for urban roads rather than highway on-off ramps. The presence of crosswalks, street signage, and nearby buildings suggests it is an urban street setting. On-off ramps generally do not have traffic signals or crosswalks as seen here.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
