NO

The road depicted in the image appears to be an intersection, not an on-off ramp. There are traffic signals and a crosswalk, indicating that it's a regular street intersection. An on-off ramp typically merges with a freeway or highway and would not have traffic signals in this position. Additionally, there are signs for directions to nearby places which are typical for an intersection, and the vehicles are seen passing through it perpendicularly, which would not be the case for an on-off ramp.
