NO.

The scene depicted in the image is an urban street intersection with traffic signals, pedestrian crossings, and buildings close to the roadside. On-off ramps typically link freeways or highways to local roads and don't have the traffic signals and pedestrian crosswalks seen here. Instead, they have yield or merge signs and acceleration/deceleration lanes for vehicles to enter or exit highways at higher speeds. This image appears to be in a city setting, not on a highway system.
