The image is blurred which makes it difficult to discern specific road details. However, from the context and what is visible, it appears to be an urban setting with buildings close to the road, multiple lanes, and a crosswalk.

Additionally, there are traffic cones suggesting some form of road work or lane modification, which is more common in city street settings than on on-off ramps.
