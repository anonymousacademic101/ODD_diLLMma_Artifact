NO.

The road does not appear to be an on-off ramp typically associated with highways or freeways. It looks more like a local street, with buildings, palm trees, and various cars parked on the side of the road. The presence of a "KEEP CLEAR" marking on the road also suggests it might be an access point to a driveway or intersection, rather than an on-off ramp where such markings are less common.
