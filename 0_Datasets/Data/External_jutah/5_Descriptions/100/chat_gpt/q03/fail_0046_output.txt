NO.

The road in the image does not appear to be an on-off ramp typically associated with highway or freeway systems. Instead, the road looks like an urban street next to a building with a clearly visible entrance and flags hanging outside, which suggests it's more likely a regular street in a city or town. On-off ramps usually don't have buildings directly adjacent to them and are designed to enable vehicles to enter or exit expressways, not to provide access to individual buildings.
