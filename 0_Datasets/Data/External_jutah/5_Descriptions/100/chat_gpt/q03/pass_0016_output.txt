This does not appear to be an on-off ramp but rather a city street. On-off ramps typically connect highways with local roads and are characterized by their curved design and dedicated exit and entrance lanes. The image shows a multi-lane street in an urban setting, with traffic signals, crosswalks, and buildings close to the road, all of which are indicative of a regular city street rather than an on-off ramp.
