NO.

This does not appear to be a traditional highway on-off ramp. The signage indicates "RAMP" and "KEEP RIGHT" which implies a transition, but given the surrounding context with the airplane and airport-related infrastructure, it suggests this is more likely an access road within an airport complex rather than a ramp onto a highway. On-off ramps typically lead to or from high-speed highways, and this road seems to be designed for lower speed, directed airport traffic.
