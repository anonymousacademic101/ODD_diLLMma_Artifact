Additionally, on-off ramps usually have curving paths and yield or merge signs instead of traffic signals. The presence of buildings directly adjacent to the road also indicates that this is a regular street rather than a highway ramp.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
