NO

The road in the image does not appear to be an on-off ramp. It seems to be an intersection in an urban area, indicated by the traffic signal, crosswalk, and the multiple lanes of traffic with cars stopped as if they are waiting at the intersection. On-off ramps typically do not have these features and are designed to allow vehicles to enter or exit highways.
