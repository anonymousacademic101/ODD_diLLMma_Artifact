NO.

Based on this image, it appears that the road is not an on-off ramp but rather a standard urban street. An on-off ramp usually connects highways to local roads and typically doesn't have features such as pedestrian sidewalks, street-level storefronts, or traffic signals like the ones visible in the picture. The scene depicted shows buildings close to the road, pedestrian crossings, and traffic lights, which are more indicative of a regular city street than a highway ramp. Additionally, the overhead structure looks more like an elevated railway or highway rather than an element of an on-off ramp.
