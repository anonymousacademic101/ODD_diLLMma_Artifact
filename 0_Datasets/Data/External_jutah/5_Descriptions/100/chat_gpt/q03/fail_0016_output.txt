NO.

The image shows a road in an urban setting with traffic signals, pedestrian crossing signs, and regular vehicular lanes, indicating it is part of a city street network rather than a dedicated on-off ramp associated with a freeway or highway. On-off ramps typically facilitate the transition between high-speed highways and local roads and generally do not feature traffic signals directly above them, nor do they have crosswalks for pedestrians as prominently featured in this scene.
