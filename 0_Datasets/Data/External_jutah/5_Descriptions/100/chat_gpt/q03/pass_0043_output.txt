NO.

The road in the image appears to be a regular city street and not an on-off ramp. There are multiple traffic signals present for different lanes, crosswalks for pedestrians, and a street sign indicating "NE 8 ST," which suggests that this is a regular intersection in an urban setting typically found within a city grid, not an interchange ramp associated with highways or freeways. On-off ramps typically do not have traffic signals, as they are designed to facilitate the smooth flow of traffic between different roadways without the need for stopping except for yield or merge signs where necessary.
