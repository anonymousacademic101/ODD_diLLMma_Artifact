NO

The road in the image does not appear to be an on-off ramp. On-off ramps typically connect highways or freeways to local roads and are characterized by a sharper curve or incline that allows vehicles to slow down when exiting or to merge when entering a highway. The road in this image looks like a regular city street with multiple lanes and a stoplight ahead, suggesting that it's part of the standard urban roadway infrastructure, not a ramp designed for the specific purpose of entering or exiting a highway.
