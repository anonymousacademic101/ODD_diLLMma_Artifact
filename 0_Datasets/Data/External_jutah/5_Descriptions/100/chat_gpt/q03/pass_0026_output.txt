This appears to be a regular city street with multiple traffic lanes and traffic lights. An on-off ramp typically connects highways or freeways and wouldn't have features like crosswalks, traffic lights, and buildings directly adjacent to the road as seen here. This street is designed for urban transit with pedestrian crossings and standard city traffic controls.
