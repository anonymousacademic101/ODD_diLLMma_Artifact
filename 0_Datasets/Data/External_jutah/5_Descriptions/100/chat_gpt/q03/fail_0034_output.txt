The road in the image does not appear to be an on-off ramp; it looks like a city street. The presence of buildings directly alongside the road, the storefronts, pedestrian sidewalks, traffic signal, and the urban environment are all indicative of a typical city road rather than a highway on-off ramp, which would generally not have direct building access or pedestrian walkways right beside the roadway.
