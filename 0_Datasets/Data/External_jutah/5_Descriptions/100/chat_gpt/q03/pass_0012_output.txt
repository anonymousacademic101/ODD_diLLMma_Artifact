NO.

The image depicts a tunnel, as indicated by its enclosed structure and lighting typically seen in such constructions. An on-off ramp would generally be open to the environment, connecting highways and local roads, and also often have signage for entering or exiting a highway, which is not visible in this image. Instead, this is a traffic tunnel that appears to facilitate the flow of vehicles through an underground passage and likely serves to connect different parts of a city or to allow passage beneath a geographical obstacle such as a river. The posted speed limit signs and the behavior of vehicles in the image align with typical tunnel traffic patterns rather than those of an on-off ramp.
