It looks more like a street in an urban area with multiple lanes, parked cars along the sides, buildings close to the street, and no immediate signs of being a highway ramp. On-off ramps typically have different characteristics such as being connected to a highway, no parked cars, and often curving or sloping to merge into highways.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
