NO.

The road we are looking at is intersecting with toll road on-off ramps, rather than being an on-off ramp itself. The image shows a conventional intersection with traffic lights and a clear indication of an overhead bridge or overpass, which typically carries the highway or toll road. The signage indicates directions to the on-off ramps of Interstate 90 (I-90) for both westbound towards Chicago and eastbound towards Ohio, but the road we're on appears to be a local street at a signalized intersection, allowing access to those ramps.
