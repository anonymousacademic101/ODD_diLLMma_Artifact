NO.

The road in the image appears to be a multi-lane freeway or highway, not an on-off ramp. On-off ramps are typically single-lane roads that serve as connectors between freeways/highways and local roads. In the image, there are several lanes of traffic, and there is no clear indication of an exit or entrance point that would signify an on-off ramp. Instead, vehicles are moving in parallel on a road designed for high-speed travel, characteristic of a main thoroughfare rather than an access ramp.
