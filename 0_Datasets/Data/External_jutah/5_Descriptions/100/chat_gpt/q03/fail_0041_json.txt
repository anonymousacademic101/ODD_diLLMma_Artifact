This can be concluded from several contextual clues: the presence of a pedestrian crosswalk with people crossing, traffic signals, speed limit signs typical for urban areas, buildings close to the street, and the absence of highway features such as merge or exit lanes. Additionally, the sign with a 'U-turn' arrow is more indicative of a city street, as U-turns are typically not allowed on highway on-off ramps due to safety concerns."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
