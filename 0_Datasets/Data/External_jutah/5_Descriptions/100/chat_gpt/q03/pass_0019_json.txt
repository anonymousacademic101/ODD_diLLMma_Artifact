On and off-ramps typically connect highways to local roads and do not have crosswalks or traffic lights as seen here. They are designed to help vehicles adjust their speed for entering or exiting highways, whereas the road in the image seems to be a regular urban thoroughfare. Additionally, there are buildings very close to the roadside, which is not characteristic of highway ramps, and there's signage for Interstate 75 which indicates a proximity to a highway but not necessarily that this is a ramp itself."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
