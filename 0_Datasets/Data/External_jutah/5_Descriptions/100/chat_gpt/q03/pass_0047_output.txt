NO.

The road depicted in the image appears to be a city street rather than an on-off ramp. We can tell this because there are multiple lanes with vehicles, traffic signals for different directions, storefronts along the side of the road, and abundant signage typical of an urban setting. On-off ramps, conversely, usually facilitate the transition between highways and local roads and do not feature urban infrastructure like traffic lights and storefronts.
