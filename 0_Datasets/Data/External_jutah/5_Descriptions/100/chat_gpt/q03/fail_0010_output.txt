NO.

The road in the image appears to be a regular intersection with traffic signals and level crossing gates for a train, which suggests that it is not an on-off ramp. On-off ramps typically lead to and from highways and do not feature railroad crossings or the standard cross-street traffic control signals seen here. Instead, this road likely serves as a normal street for urban or suburban traffic, which may intersect with train tracks as seen.
