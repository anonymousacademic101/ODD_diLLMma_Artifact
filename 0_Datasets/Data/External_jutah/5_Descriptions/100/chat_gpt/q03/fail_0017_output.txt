NO.

The road in the image does not appear to be an on-ramp or off-ramp of a highway. It looks like a regular city street with traffic signals, crosswalks, and buildings close to the road, which are typical features of urban roads, not freeway ramps. The lane designations and traffic lights also suggest it is an intersection within a city, not a ramp for entering or exiting a freeway.
