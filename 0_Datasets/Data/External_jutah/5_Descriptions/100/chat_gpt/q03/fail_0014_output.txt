NO.

The road shown in the image is an urban street, not an on-off ramp. This can be determined by the presence of features common in city streets such as storefronts, pedestrian crossings, traffic signals, and buildings close to the road. On-off ramps typically connect highways to local roads and do not have the urban infrastructure or environment as seen in this picture.
