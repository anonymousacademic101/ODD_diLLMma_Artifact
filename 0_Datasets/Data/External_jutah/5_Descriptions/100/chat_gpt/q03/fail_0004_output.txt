The image shows a vehicle stopped at a traffic light where there are multiple lanes of traffic, traffic signals, and a marked crosswalk, which is characteristic of a regular intersection, not an on-off ramp. On-off ramps typically facilitate the transition between highways and local roads and usually do not have traffic lights or crosswalks as seen in this image.
