NO.

The road in the image does not resemble an on-off ramp typically associated with highways or freeways. On-off ramps are designed to allow vehicles to enter and exit highways at speed, and they are generally characterized by their curvature and the presence of acceleration and deceleration lanes. The road in this image appears to be an urban street with brick pavement, adjacent to a plaza or public space with a monument, and surrounded by buildings. This setting is more indicative of a city street or a road in an urban center rather than an on-off ramp.
