NO.

The road in the image is an urban street and not an on-off ramp. On-off ramps are typically associated with highways or freeways and are designed for vehicles to enter and exit at higher speeds. This road has multiple lanes, parked cars, a city bus, traffic lights, and buildings close to the street, which are all characteristic of a typical city street rather than an on-off ramp.
