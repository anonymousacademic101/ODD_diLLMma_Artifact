On-off ramps typically connect highways to local roads and do not have traffic signals at the end but might feature yield or stop signs. The presence of buildings directly at the street corners, the crosswalks, and the overall setting suggest this is not an on-off ramp but rather a typical city street at an intersection with traffic lights.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
