NO.

The road in the image doesn't have the characteristics of a typical on-off ramp. On-off ramps are typically associated with highways and interstates to help vehicles enter or exit these roads. The scene in the image shows a traffic signal-controlled intersection with multiple lanes and crosswalks, buildings alongside the road, and cars stopped at the red light, which are indications of an urban or suburban street rather than an on-off ramp to a highway or freeway.
