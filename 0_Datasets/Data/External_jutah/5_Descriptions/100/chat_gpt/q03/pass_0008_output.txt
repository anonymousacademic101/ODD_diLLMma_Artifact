NO.

The road in the image appears to be a coastal highway or scenic route rather than an on-off ramp. On-off ramps generally connect highways to local roads and feature tight curves or exit and entrance lanes specifically designed to manage the flow of traffic merging onto or off of highways. This particular road is running parallel to the shoreline with continuous lanes, suggesting it is a main route rather than a transitional ramp.
