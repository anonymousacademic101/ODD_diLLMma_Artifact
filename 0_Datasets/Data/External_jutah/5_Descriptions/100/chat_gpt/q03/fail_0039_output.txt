NO.

Based on the visible traffic lights and multiple lanes that seem to continue straight ahead, as well as the presence of buildings closely flanking the road, it suggests that we are on a city street rather than an on-ramp or off-ramp, which typically connect highways to local roads and do not have complex intersections with traffic lights directly on them.
