It seems to be a regular multi-lane road equipped with traffic lights for controlled intersections. On-off ramps typically provide a transition between surface streets and freeways/highways and do not have traffic lights as seen in this image. The road also has clearly marked lanes for traffic moving in both directions, which is characteristic of typical city streets rather than freeway on-off ramps.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
