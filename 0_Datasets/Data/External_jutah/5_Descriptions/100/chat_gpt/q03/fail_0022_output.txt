The image depicts an urban street scene with multilane roads, traffic signals, and surrounding buildings that are common in city environments rather than on-off ramps that typically connect highways to local roads. On-off ramps usually do not have crosswalks, traffic signal-controlled intersections, or adjacent buildings as seen in this picture.
