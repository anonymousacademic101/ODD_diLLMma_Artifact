This image shows a stop sign and an arrow indicating a right turn onto a road that has a sign for Highway 93 with an "NORTH" indicator. The one-way sign also indicates that the road being turned onto is for one-way traffic. These are typical features you might encounter at an on-off ramp for a highway where traffic from a smaller road or access point is regulated before merging with or exiting from the faster and busier main highway lanes.
