NO.

The signs and traffic signals visible in the image suggest that this is likely a regular intersection, not an on-off ramp. On-off ramps typically do not have traffic signals like the ones shown because they are meant for merging onto or exiting highways, and the signage would be different, directing traffic onto a highway or service road rather than indicating the present regular traffic directions. Additionally, the presence of pedestrian crossings and the urban setting further suggest this is not an on-off ramp.
