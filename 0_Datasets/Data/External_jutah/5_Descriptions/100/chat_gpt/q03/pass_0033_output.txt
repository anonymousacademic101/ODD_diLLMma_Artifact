From the image, we can see vehicles merging from the right onto the main roadway; the dashed lines on both sides, along with the presence of an acceleration lane, suggest this is an on-off ramp used for entering or leaving a freeway. Additionally, the concrete barrier dividing the ramp from the main travel lanes is typical of highway design for ramps.
