NO.

Explanation: The road in the image appears to be an urban street intersecting with another road at a traffic signal. On-off ramps typically connect highways to local roads and do not have crosswalks, bicycle lanes, or regular traffic signal intersections as seen in this image. The presence of shops, pedestrians, and the overall layout suggest this is an urban street rather than an on-off ramp.
