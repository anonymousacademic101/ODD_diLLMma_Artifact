NO.

The road depicted in the image is an urban street lined with businesses, including motels and shops, and it is a typical city roadway with traffic signals and palm trees along the sides. On-off ramps are usually associated with highways or freeways and have a different design, typically without direct access to shops and businesses, and are meant to serve as connections between highway speeds and local road speeds. This road does not have the characteristics of an on-off ramp and is more indicative of a regular street within a city.
