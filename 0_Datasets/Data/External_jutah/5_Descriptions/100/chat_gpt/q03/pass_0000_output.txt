The image shows a road with vehicles traveling in parallel directions, divided by a median, which is typical of a main road or highway, not the characteristics of an on-off ramp which generally have a singular direction of travel and are designed to allow vehicles to enter or exit highways. Moreover, the presence of a traffic signal in the distance suggests intersection controls that are not common for on-off ramps. The orange construction cones indicate there may be road work or lane modifications, but they do not change the fundamental nature of the road.
