NO

This does not appear to be an on-off ramp. The setting looks like an urban street, with buildings on either side, street-facing storefronts, parallel parked cars, pedestrian walkways, and traffic signals ahead. On-off ramps typically connect highways to local roads and do not have these features. They usually have signage indicating the entrance or exit to a highway, which is not visible here.
