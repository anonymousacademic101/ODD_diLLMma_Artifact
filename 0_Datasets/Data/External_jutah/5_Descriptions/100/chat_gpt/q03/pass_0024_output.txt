YES.

The road in the image appears to be an on-off ramp because there are signs indicating an exit for the 427 South and 401 West, which typically designate an interchange where drivers can enter or exit major highways. The road design also seems to taper off from main traffic lanes, suggesting it's a connector ramp between the highways mentioned on the signs.
