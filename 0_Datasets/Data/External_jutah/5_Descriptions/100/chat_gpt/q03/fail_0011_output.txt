The road does not appear to be an on-off ramp. On-off ramps typically connect highways to local roads and are characterized by either merging lanes or dedicated exit/entry lanes. In this image, we see a traffic light, which indicates this is likely a regular intersection on a city street or another type of thoroughfare, as traffic lights are not commonly found on highway ramps. Furthermore, the presence of a utility vehicle stopped at the light and other features of the surrounding area, such as a sidewalk bench, suggests this is an urban or suburban setting rather than a limited-access highway where on-off ramps would be located.
