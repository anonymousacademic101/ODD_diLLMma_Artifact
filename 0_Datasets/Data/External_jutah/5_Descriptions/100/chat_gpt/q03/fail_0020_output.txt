NO.

The image shows a deteriorating urban road with an abandoned or decaying building on the side. An on-off ramp typically refers to roads designed for accessing or leaving highways, characterized by smoother curves and sometimes controlled by traffic lights or yield signs to manage the traffic merging with the highway. The road in the photo neither shows the characteristics of an on-off ramp, such as direct access to a highway, nor does it have the infrastructure that usually accompanies ramps, like signage or merging lanes. It appears to be a regular street, not suited for high-speed traffic or highway access.
