NO.

This roadway appears to be an urban street with multiple lanes, traffic lights, and crossing for pedestrians. On-off ramps typically connect highways to local roads and usually don't have features like crosswalks and traffic lights directly on them. The presence of a bus and typical urban infrastructure also suggests this is not an on-off ramp.
