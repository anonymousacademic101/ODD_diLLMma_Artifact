NO

The road depicted in the image does not appear to be an on-off ramp. It looks like a city street with multiple lanes and traffic signals, which is typical for urban roads rather than highway on-off ramps. The presence of crosswalks, street signage, and nearby buildings suggests it is an urban street setting. On-off ramps generally do not have traffic signals or crosswalks as seen here.
