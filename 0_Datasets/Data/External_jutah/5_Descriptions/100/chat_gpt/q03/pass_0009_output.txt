The road we are looking at does not appear to be an on-off ramp. This road has multiple lanes with a median and traffic traveling in the same direction, which is characteristic of a highway or a multi-lane road rather than an on-off ramp. On-off ramps typically have fewer lanes and are designed for vehicles to enter or exit highways, and they usually merge into or out of the main traffic flow, which is not evident in the image provided.
