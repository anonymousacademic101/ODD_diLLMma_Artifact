NO.

The road in the image appears to be a regular city street or industrial area road. The presence of parking on the side of the road, buildings close to the roadside, and no visible entry or exit ramps indicate that this is not an on-off ramp associated with a highway or freeway system. On-off ramps typically have a more clear designation for the purpose of entering or exiting a highway, and they generally do not have parking or direct access to commercial or industrial buildings.
