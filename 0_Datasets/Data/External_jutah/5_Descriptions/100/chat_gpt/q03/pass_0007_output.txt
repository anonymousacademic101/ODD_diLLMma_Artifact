NO.

The road in the image appears to be a standard two-way street rather than an on-off ramp. On-off ramps typically connect highways to local roads or other highways and are characterized by their curved shapes and the absence of properties like houses or businesses directly adjacent to them. The road in the photo shows buildings close to the roadside and a regular two-way traffic setup, which suggests it's a local road within a town or a city, not an on-off ramp.
