The image shows traffic signals and signs that indicate a regular intersection in an urban setting, not an on-off ramp. On-off ramps typically lead to and from highways and do not have traffic signals like the ones shown in the image. The "Do Not Enter" and "One Way" signs suggest that the road is a part of a standard street grid, not an on-off ramp.
