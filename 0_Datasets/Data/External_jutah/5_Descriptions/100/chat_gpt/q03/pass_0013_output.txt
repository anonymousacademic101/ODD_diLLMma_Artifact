NO.

The road in the image does not appear to be an on-off ramp. It seems to be a standard rural or suburban two-lane road because there are no indications of freeway or highway entry or exit functions, such as acceleration or deceleration lanes, signage pertaining to freeways, or other markers typical for on-off ramps. The road also displays features like a mailbox and a power line, which are generally not found along on-off ramps.
