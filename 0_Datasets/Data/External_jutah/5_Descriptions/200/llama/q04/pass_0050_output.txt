Yes, the road we are driving on is an intersection. The image shows a street with several buildings on either side, including a hotel, a restaurant, and a convenience store. The street is lined with palm trees and has a few cars parked on the side of the road. The sky is clear and the sun is setting in the background, casting a warm orange glow over the scene.</s>
