NO, the image does not have poor visibility. It appears to be a clear nighttime shot of a city street with tall buildings in the background. There are cars parked on the side of the road and pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. There is no evidence of heavy rain, snow, fog, or adverse weather conditions in the image.</s>
