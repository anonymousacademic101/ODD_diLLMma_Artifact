NO, the road is not a sharp curve. The image shows a busy street with many cars, buses, and pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The buildings on either side of the street are tall and modern, with neon lights and billboards advertising various products and services. The overall atmosphere is bustling and vibrant, with a lot of activity happening on the street at night.</s>
