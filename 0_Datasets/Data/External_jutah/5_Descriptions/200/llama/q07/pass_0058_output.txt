Yes, there are bright lights from oncoming headlights in the image. The lights are coming from the left side of the image, and they are very bright. There is also direct sunlight coming from the right side of the image, but it is not as bright as the headlights.

The reason why there are bright lights from oncoming headlights in the image is because the camera is facing a busy street with tall buildings on either side. The headlights of cars driving down the street are reflecting off the windows of the buildings, creating a bright glare. Additionally, there is direct sunlight coming from the right side of the image, but it is not as bright as the headlights.</s>
