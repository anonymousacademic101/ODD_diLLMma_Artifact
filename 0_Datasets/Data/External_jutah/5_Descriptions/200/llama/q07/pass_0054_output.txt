Yes, there are bright lights from oncoming headlights in the image. The lights are coming from the cars in the left lane, which are driving in the same direction as the camera. The lights are also coming from the building on the right side of the image, which appears to be a hotel or casino. The lights are not direct sunlight into the camera, as the sun is not visible in the image.</s>
