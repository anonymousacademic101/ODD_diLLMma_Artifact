This image shows an abandoned building on a dirt road in a rural area. The building is made of red brick and has several windows on the upper floors. The roof is missing tiles and there are holes in the walls. The road is empty and there are no cars or pedestrians in sight. The sky is cloudy and there is a small puddle of water on the road. The time of day is difficult to determine, but it appears to be early in the morning or late in the afternoon.</s>
