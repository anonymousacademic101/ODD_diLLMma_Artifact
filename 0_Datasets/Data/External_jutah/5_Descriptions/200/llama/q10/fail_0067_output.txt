This image shows a street with a row of brick buildings on either side. The buildings are three stories tall and have large windows on the second and third floors. There are no cars parked on the street, and there are no pedestrians in sight. The sky is clear and blue, with a large American flag waving in the background. The time of day appears to be late morning or early afternoon, as the sun is shining brightly and there are no shadows on the buildings. There are no road signs or traffic lights visible in the image.</s>
