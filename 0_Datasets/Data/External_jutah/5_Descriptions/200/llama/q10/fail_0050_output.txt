This image shows a construction site on a city street. The road is blocked off with orange cones and there are construction workers in hard hats and safety vests directing traffic. There are also pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The buildings on either side of the street are under construction, with scaffolding and construction materials visible. The time of day is likely early morning or late afternoon, as there are few cars on the road and the sun is either rising or setting.</s>
