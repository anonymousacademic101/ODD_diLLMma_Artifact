This image shows a large, brick building with several windows on the upper floors. The building is located on a city street with a sidewalk on one side and a crosswalk on the other. There are no cars parked on the street, but there are several parked on the side of the road. The sky is cloudy and there is rain falling from the sky. The time of day is difficult to determine, but it appears to be early morning or late afternoon based on the shadows cast by the buildings and the position of the sun. There are no pedestrians visible in the image.</s>
