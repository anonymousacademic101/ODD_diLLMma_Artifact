This image shows a street scene in a city. The road is empty and there are no cars or pedestrians in sight. The sky is cloudy and there is a light breeze blowing. The buildings on either side of the road are tall and made of brick. One of them has a clock tower on top. There are no trees or other vegetation in sight. The time of day is difficult to determine, but it appears to be early in the morning or late in the afternoon.</s>
