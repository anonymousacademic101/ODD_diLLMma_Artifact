The image shows a city street with several cars parked on the side of the road. The road is lined with trees and bushes, and there are several pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The sky is cloudy, and there are a few birds flying in the air. The time of day appears to be early morning or late afternoon, as there are not many cars on the road and the sun is not directly overhead. The road signs indicate that the street is one way, and there are traffic lights at the intersections. The buildings on either side of the road are tall and made of glass and steel, and they appear to be office buildings.</s>
