The image shows a street scene with a large building on the left side of the road. The building appears to be an old warehouse or factory, with large windows and a red awning over the entrance. There are several cars parked in front of the building, and a few pedestrians can be seen walking on the sidewalk. The sky is cloudy and there is a light breeze blowing. The time of day appears to be late afternoon or early evening, based on the shadows cast by the buildings and the position of the sun. There are no other vehicles or pedestrians visible in the image.</s>
