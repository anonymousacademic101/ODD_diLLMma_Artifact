This image shows a street with a train track running underneath it. The road is empty and there are no cars or pedestrians in sight. The sky is clear and the sun is setting in the background, casting a warm orange glow over the scene. The buildings on either side of the road are tall and modern, with large windows and balconies. There are no trees or other vegetation in sight. The time of day appears to be late afternoon or early evening, based on the shadows cast by the buildings and the position of the sun in the sky.</s>
