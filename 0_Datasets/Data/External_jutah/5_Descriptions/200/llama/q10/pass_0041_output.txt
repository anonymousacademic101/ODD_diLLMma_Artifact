This is an image of a city street with a few cars parked on the side of the road. There are buildings on either side of the street, and a bridge can be seen in the distance. The sky is cloudy and there is a light drizzle of rain. There are no pedestrians or other vehicles in the image. The time of day is difficult to determine, but it appears to be early in the morning or late in the evening.</s>
