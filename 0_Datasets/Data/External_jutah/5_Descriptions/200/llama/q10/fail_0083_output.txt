The image shows a city street at night with tall buildings on either side. The road is empty, with no cars or pedestrians in sight. There are streetlights on both sides of the road, casting a warm glow on the asphalt. The buildings are made of brick and stone, with large windows and balconies on the upper floors. Some of the windows are lit up, casting a warm glow on the street below. The time of day is difficult to determine, but it appears to be late in the evening based on the shadows cast by the buildings and the streetlights. Overall, the image conveys a sense of quiet and peacefulness in the city at night.</s>
