This is an image of a city street at night. There are tall buildings on either side of the street, with large windows and balconies. The street is empty, with no cars or pedestrians in sight. There are streetlights on either side of the street, casting a warm glow over the area. The sky is dark and cloudy, with a few stars visible in the distance. The time of day is unknown, but it appears to be late at night based on the darkness of the sky.</s>
