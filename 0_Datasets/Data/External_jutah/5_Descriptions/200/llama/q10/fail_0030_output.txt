This image shows a street with a traffic light at the intersection of two roads. The buildings on either side of the street are tall and made of brick, with large windows and balconies on the upper floors. There are a few pedestrians walking on the sidewalk, and a car is stopped at the traffic light. The time of day appears to be late afternoon or early evening, as the sun is setting behind the buildings. There are no other cars or pedestrians visible in the image.</s>
