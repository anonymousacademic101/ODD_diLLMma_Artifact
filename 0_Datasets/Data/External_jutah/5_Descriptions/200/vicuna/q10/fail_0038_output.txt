This is a view of a road in a residential area. The road is wet from rain and there are trees on either side of the road. There are no cars on the road, but there are some pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The time of day appears to be early morning, as there is still some darkness in the sky. There are no road signs visible in this image.
