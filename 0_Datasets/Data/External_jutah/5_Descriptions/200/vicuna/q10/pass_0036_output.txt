The image shows a city street with several buildings on either side of the road. The buildings appear to be made of red brick and have large windows. There are several cars parked on the side of the road, and a few pedestrians can be seen walking on the sidewalk. The road has two lanes, one for traffic heading in each direction. There are traffic lights at the intersection, and a sign indicating the speed limit. It appears to be daytime, as there are no lights on in the buildings and the sky is clear.
