The image shows a view of a city street on a rainy day. The street is lined with tall buildings on both sides and there are several cars parked on the side of the road. The road is wet and there are puddles of water on it. There are also yellow traffic cones on the road, indicating some kind of construction or maintenance work happening. The time of day appears to be morning, as there are still some lights on in the buildings and the sky is still dark. There are no pedestrians visible in the image.
