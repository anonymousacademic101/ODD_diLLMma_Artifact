This image shows a busy city street at night. The street is lined with tall buildings on both sides, some of which have illuminated signs. The road is divided into multiple lanes, with cars traveling in both directions. There are also pedestrians on the sidewalk, some of whom are crossing the street. The time of day appears to be evening or night, as the sky is dark and there are lights on in the buildings.
