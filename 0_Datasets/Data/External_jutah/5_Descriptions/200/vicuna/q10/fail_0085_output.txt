This image shows a busy city street at dusk. The street is lined with tall buildings on both sides, some of which have lit up at night. There are several lanes of traffic, including cars, buses, and trucks, traveling in both directions. There are also several crosswalks and intersections where pedestrians can be seen crossing the street. The time of day is dusk, as the sky is dark, but there is still some light coming from the buildings and streetlights. The weather seems to be clear and cool, as there are no clouds or fog in the sky. Overall, this is a busy and bustling city street at dusk.
