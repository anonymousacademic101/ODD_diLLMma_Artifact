The image shows a long, winding road that runs along the side of a steep cliff overlooking the ocean. The road is made of asphalt and has two lanes, one for each direction of traffic. There are no pedestrians or other vehicles visible in the image. The sky is clear and blue, and the sun is shining down on the road. There are no road signs or other markers visible in the image. The time of day appears to be morning, as the sun is just starting to rise over the horizon. The image is taken from a high angle, looking down onto the road from the top of the cliff.
