The image shows a city street with tall buildings on both sides of the road. The street is empty of cars, but there are several pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The road has two lanes, one for each direction of traffic, and there are traffic lights at the intersection. The buildings are made of concrete and steel, with large windows and balconies on some of them. The sky is clear and blue, and there are no clouds visible. It appears to be a sunny day.
