This is an image of a city street with palm trees lining both sides of the road. The road has two lanes, one for traffic going in each direction. There is a traffic light at the intersection, with a green light for traffic going straight, a red light for traffic turning left, and a yellow light for traffic turning right. There are no pedestrians visible in the image. The time of day appears to be daytime, as there is bright sunlight shining down on the road and the cars have their headlights on. The image was taken from a driver's perspective, looking out the front windshield of a car.
