This is a view of a city street at dusk. The street is lined with tall buildings on both sides, some of which have reflective glass facades that catch the light of the setting sun. The road is straight and wide, with two lanes in each direction. There are no cars or pedestrians visible in the image, but there are streetlights on both sides of the road. The time of day is dusk, and the sky is a mix of pink, orange, and blue hues.
