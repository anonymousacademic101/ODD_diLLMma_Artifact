This is a photograph of a city street with tall buildings on either side. The road is divided into multiple lanes, with cars driving in both directions. There are traffic lights and road signs indicating the flow of traffic. Pedestrians can be seen crossing the street at various points. The time of day appears to be daytime, as there are no lights on in the buildings and the sun is shining.
