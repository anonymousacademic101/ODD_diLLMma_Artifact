This image shows a busy city street at night. The street is lined with tall buildings on both sides, with many cars, trucks, and buses driving on the road. There are also several pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The street is well-lit with streetlights, and there are traffic lights regulating the flow of traffic. The time of day appears to be night, as the sky is dark, and the lights from the buildings and streetlights are bright. The image is taken from a high angle, looking down onto the street.
