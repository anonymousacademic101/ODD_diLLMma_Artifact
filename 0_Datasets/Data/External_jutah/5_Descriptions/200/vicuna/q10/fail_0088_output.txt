This image shows a busy city street with a church in the background. The church appears to be made of stone and has a tall steeple. The street is lined with tall buildings on both sides and there are several cars parked on the side of the road. There are also several pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The time of day appears to be daytime, as there are no lights on in the buildings or on the street. The weather appears to be cloudy, as there are clouds visible in the sky.
