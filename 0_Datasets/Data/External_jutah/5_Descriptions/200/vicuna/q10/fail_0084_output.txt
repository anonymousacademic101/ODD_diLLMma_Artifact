This image shows a busy city street at night. The street is lined with tall buildings on both sides, some of which have lit up windows. There are several lanes of traffic, including cars, trucks, and buses, traveling in both directions. There are also several pedestrians crossing the street, some of whom are carrying shopping bags. The traffic lights are green, indicating that it is safe to proceed through the intersection. The time of day is likely evening or night, as the sky is dark and there are lights on in the buildings.
