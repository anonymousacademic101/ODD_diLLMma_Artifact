The image shows a city street scene with tall buildings on either side of the road. There are several cars parked on the side of the road and a few pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The road has two lanes, one for traffic going in each direction. There is a traffic light at the intersection, with a green light for traffic going straight, a red light for traffic turning left, and a yellow light for traffic turning right. There is a crosswalk for pedestrians to cross the street. The time of day appears to be daytime, as there are no lights on in the buildings and the sun is shining.
