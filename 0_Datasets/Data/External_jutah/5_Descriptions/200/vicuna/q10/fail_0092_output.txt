This image depicts a city street scene at night. The buildings on either side of the street are tall and modern, with large windows and a glass facade. There are several palm trees lining the sidewalk, and the road is made of asphalt. There are no cars visible in the image, but there are several pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The streetlights are on and casting a warm orange glow on the scene. The time of day appears to be evening, as the sky is dark, but there is still some light left in the sky. Overall, the scene is peaceful and quiet, with no major distractions for drivers.
