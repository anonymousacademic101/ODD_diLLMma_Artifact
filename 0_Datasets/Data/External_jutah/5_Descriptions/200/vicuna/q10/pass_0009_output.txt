This is a view of a city street in Miami, Florida. The street is lined with tall white buildings on both sides, with palm trees growing in the median. There are several cars parked on the side of the road, and a few pedestrians can be seen walking along the sidewalk. The sky is clear and blue, and there are no clouds in the sky. The time of day appears to be around midday, as the sun is shining brightly and casting shadows on the ground. The temperature is likely warm, as there are no coats or jackets visible on the people walking on the sidewalk.
