This image shows a view of a city street on a rainy day. The street is lined with tall buildings on both sides, some of which have balconies and windows. There are several cars parked on the side of the road, and a few pedestrians can be seen walking on the sidewalk. The road is wet and shiny from the rain, and there is a large overpass in the background, with traffic passing over it. The time of day appears to be late afternoon or early evening, as the sun is setting behind the buildings.
