The image shows a city street with parked cars on either side of the road. The cars are parked parallel to the curb, leaving enough space for pedestrians to walk by. The road has a yellow line down the middle, indicating that it is a one-way street. There is a large tree on the right side of the road, partially blocking the view of the building behind it. The building appears to be made of concrete and has several windows on the upper floors. There is a fire escape ladder on the left side of the building. The time of day appears to be morning, as there are no people visible on the street.
