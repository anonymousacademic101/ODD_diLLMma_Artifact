This image shows a busy city street at night. The street is lined with tall buildings on both sides, some of which have illuminated billboards. There are several lanes of traffic, including cars, taxis, and buses, traveling in both directions. There are also several pedestrians on the sidewalk, some of whom are crossing the street. The time of day is night, as the sky is dark and there are lights from the buildings and streetlights illuminating the area. The weather appears to be clear, as there are no clouds visible in the sky.
