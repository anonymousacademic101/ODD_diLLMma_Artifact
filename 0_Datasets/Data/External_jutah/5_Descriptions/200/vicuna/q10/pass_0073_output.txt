There are several lanes of traffic, including cars, taxis, and buses, traveling in both directions. The road surface appears to be smooth and well-maintained.

There are several traffic signs visible, including stop signs, yield signs, and one-way signs. Some of the signs are illuminated, making them easier to see at night. There are also pedestrian crossings, marked by white lines and signs, where pedestrians can safely cross the street.

Drivers on the street need to pay attention to the traffic signs and signals, as well as the other vehicles and pedestrians around them. They should also be mindful of their speed and the potential for congestion, as the street appears to be quite busy.

Overall, the image shows a typical city street at night, with a mix of commercial and residential buildings, busy traffic, and pedestrian activity.
