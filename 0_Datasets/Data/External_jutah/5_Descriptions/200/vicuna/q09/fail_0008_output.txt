Yes, the road we are driving on is hilly.

The image shows a black SUV driving on a hilly road with palm trees on either side of the road. The road appears to be winding and uneven, with the SUV moving up and down as it follows the contours of the road. The trees on either side of the road provide some shade, but the sun is still shining brightly, casting shadows on the ground and the SUV. The sky is clear and blue, with only a few scattered clouds visible.
