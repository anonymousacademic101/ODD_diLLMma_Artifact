Yes, the road we are driving on is hilly.

The image shows a busy street with cars parked on both sides of the road, and palm trees lining the sidewalk. The buildings on either side of the street appear to be tall and white, with large windows and balconies. It is likely that the road is hilly, as there are no visible inclines or declines in the image.
