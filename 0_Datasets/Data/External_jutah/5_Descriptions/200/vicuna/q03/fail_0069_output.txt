Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a group of cars parked on the side of a road in front of a tall building with many windows. The cars are parked next to each other and there are no other vehicles on the road. The building has a modern design with white walls and large windows that go all the way up to the top. There are several trees on the side of the road, some of which have yellow cones around their bases. The road appears to be a city street with a sidewalk on one side and a row of parked cars on the other.
