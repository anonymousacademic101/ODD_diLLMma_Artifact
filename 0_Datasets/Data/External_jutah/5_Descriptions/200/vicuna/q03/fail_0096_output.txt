Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a city street at night, with streetlights illuminating the road and buildings on either side. Cars are driving on the road, and there are no pedestrians visible. The road appears to be an on-off ramp, as there is a barrier in the middle of the road, and cars are entering and exiting the ramp. The buildings on either side of the road are tall and seem to be made of concrete or brick. There is a bridge in the background, and the sky appears to be cloudy.
