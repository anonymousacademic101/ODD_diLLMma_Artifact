NO, the road in the image is not an on-off ramp.

An on-off ramp is a type of road that allows vehicles to enter or exit a controlled-access highway, such as a freeway or motorway. On-off ramps typically have traffic signals or signs to control the flow of traffic and ensure the safety of drivers and pedestrians. The road in the image appears to be a city street with buildings on either side, and there is no indication that it is an on-off ramp.
