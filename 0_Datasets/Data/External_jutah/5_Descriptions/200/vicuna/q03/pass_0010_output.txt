Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The on-off ramp is a type of road that allows vehicles to enter or exit a controlled-access highway, such as a freeway or expressway. On-off ramps are typically located at interchanges, where two or more highways meet. They are designed to allow traffic to flow smoothly and safely between the different highways.

On-off ramps typically have two lanes: one for traffic entering the highway, and one for traffic exiting the highway. They may also have a third lane for turning vehicles or for merging traffic from other roads.

On-off ramps are important for maintaining the flow of traffic on controlled-access highways, as they allow vehicles to enter and exit the highway safely and efficiently. They also help to reduce congestion and delays on the highways.
