Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a black SUV driving on a road that appears to be an on-off ramp. There are trees and buildings visible in the background, and there are no other vehicles on the road. The road appears to be straight and level, with no turns or intersections visible.

Based on the image, it is likely that the road is an on-off ramp, as it appears to be a continuation of a larger road that is not visible in the image. The absence of other vehicles and the straight and level nature of the road also suggest that it is an on-off ramp.
