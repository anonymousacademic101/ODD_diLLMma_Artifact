NO.

The road seen in the image does not appear to be on a sharp curve. The lanes look fairly straight with a gentle curve in the distance, which can be discerned by the angle and direction of the vehicles ahead as well as the orientation of the highway signs and barriers. Sharp curves typically require significant steering adjustments and often have warning signs to alert drivers, none of which are evident in this image.
