The image shows a city intersection with straight sections of road visible. While there are multiple directions in which a vehicle could proceed, there's no indication in the immediate view that there is a sharp curve on the road ahead. The visual evidence suggests the road configuration around the intersection is typical for an urban grid and not of a sharp curve.
