NO

The road within the image does not appear to be on a sharp curve. Instead, it shows a gentle bend or curve in a tunnel, which does not qualify as a "sharp" curve. Sharp curves would indicate a more sudden and acute change in direction, which doesn't seem to be the case here based on the visible lines and flow of traffic. The cars are spaced out in a way that suggests they are not maneuvering a tight turn.
