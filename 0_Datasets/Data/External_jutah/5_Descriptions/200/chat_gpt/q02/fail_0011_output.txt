The road ahead curves to the right and, based on the perspective in the photo, it appears that the angle of the curve could be quite significant, making it a sharp curve. The exact sharpness would be determined by how much the road bends and the radius of the curve, which aren't fully discernible from the photo, but the visible section suggests a substantial change in direction.
