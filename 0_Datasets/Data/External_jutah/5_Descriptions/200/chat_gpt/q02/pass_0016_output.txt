The road ahead appears to curve to the right, as indicated by the direction of the lanes and the roadside infrastructure bending in that direction. This suggests the presence of a curve, although the term "sharp" can be subjective, the visible road signs, and the angle at which the road appears to bend indicate that it is indeed a sharp curve.
