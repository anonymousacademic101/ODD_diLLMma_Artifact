The road ahead appears to be relatively straight with a gentle curve, rather than a sharp curve. The traffic lanes and the movement of the vehicles on the road indicate a straight route that slightly bends in the distance, which is characteristic of a normal urban road alignment and does not suggest a sharp curve.
