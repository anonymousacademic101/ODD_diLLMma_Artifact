NO.

The road shown in the image is at an intersection and not displaying attributes of a sharp curve. Instead, it appears to be part of a typical urban grid layout with a perpendicular cross-street. Sharp curves usually involve a significant bend in the road that changes the direction of travel in a more pronounced, continuous way, which is not visible here.
