NO.

The road depicted in the image appears to be relatively straight ahead with only a slight bend to the left in the distance, but it does not show a sharp curve. The vehicles are oriented in a nearly straight line and the lane markings guide in a slight bend rather than a sharp turn. Sharp curves typically feature a significant change in direction over a short distance, which is not evident in this image.
