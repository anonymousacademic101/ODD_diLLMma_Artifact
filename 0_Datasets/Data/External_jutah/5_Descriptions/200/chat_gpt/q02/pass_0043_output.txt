The road we are viewing in the image appears relatively straight with a gentle curve in the urban environment, rather than a sharp curve. It shows a city street scene with traffic, which suggests that any curves would be moderate to accommodate the urban traffic flow and layout, not a sharp curve that is typically found on rural or mountainous roads.
