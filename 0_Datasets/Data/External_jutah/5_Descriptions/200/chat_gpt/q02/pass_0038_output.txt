NO.

The road ahead does not appear to make a sharp curve. It seems to continue straight towards the city skyline in the distance. The intersection is controlled by traffic lights, and the lanes on the opposite side of the intersection continue in the same direction, suggesting a straight path rather than a sharp curve.
