The road seen in the image is not on a sharp curve. It appears to be a relatively straight section of an urban street with lanes going directly forward as indicated by the road markings and the positioning of the vehicles. The tall buildings flanking both sides further suggest that this is a straight roadway common in city grid layouts.
