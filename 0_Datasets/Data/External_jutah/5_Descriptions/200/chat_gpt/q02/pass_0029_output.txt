No.

The road shown in the image appears to be a relatively straight urban street with a slight bend in the distance, but it is not a sharp curve. The road seems to have multiple lanes and traffic signals, typical of urban roads, and the vehicles are positioned as if they are on a straight part of the roadway. Sharp curves are generally characterized by a more immediate and noticeable change in direction, which is not evident in this image.
