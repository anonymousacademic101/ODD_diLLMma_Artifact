NO

The road ahead does not appear to present a sharp curve. Instead, it seems to extend straight forward with a slight bend to the left in the distance, which is not enough to be characterized as a sharp curve. Sharp curves are typically indicated by immediate and significant changes in direction, requiring drivers to reduce speed substantially to navigate safely.
