NO.

The road shown in the image appears to be intersecting with another, with traffic lights present and multiple lanes for straight and turning traffic. The road ahead does not show a sharp curve; it looks like a standard city street junction. There are signs indicating directions for turns, but no visible sharp bend in the road.
