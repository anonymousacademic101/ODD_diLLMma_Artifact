The image shows a straight section of road at a signaled intersection, with clearly marked lanes indicating that the road continues straight ahead. Furthermore, the traffic signals are indicating a green light for going straight in the lanes we can see. There is a "LEFT LANE MUST TURN LEFT" sign, suggesting there is a turn lane to the left, but the lane we are "in" does not appear to be curving sharply.
