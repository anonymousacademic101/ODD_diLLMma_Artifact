There isn't enough visible road in the image to ascertain whether it is curving sharply or not. However, the portion of the road that is visible appears to be straight, showing parked cars aligned in a straightforward manner alongside the curb. The scene looks like a typical city street without immediate indicators of a sharp curve ahead within the visible frame.
