NO.

The road in the image appears to be relatively straight in the section we are looking at, with no indications that there is a sharp curve ahead from what we can see. The yellow lines are straight, and the visual lines created by buildings and parked cars also give the impression of a straight roadway ahead. There might be curves beyond the visible area, but based on the available information, we cannot confirm a sharp curve in the immediate vicinity.
