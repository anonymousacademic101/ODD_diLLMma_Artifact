The road shown in the image is straight for the visible distance, with no sharp curves apparent in the section that can be seen. It runs alongside derelict and damaged industrial buildings and is visibly cracked and overgrown with vegetation, suggesting it is not well-maintained, but it does not curve sharply within the field of view provided by the image.
