The road visible in the image appears to be relatively straight, with a slight curve to the left in the distance, but not a sharp curve. The street is well-lit with multiple lanes and bordered by commercial buildings, and there is other traffic on the road, indicating it is an urban area with a regular thoroughfare rather than a sharp, winding road.
