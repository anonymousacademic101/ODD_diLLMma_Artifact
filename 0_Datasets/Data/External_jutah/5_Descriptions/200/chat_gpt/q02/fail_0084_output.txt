Based on the image provided, we do not seem to be on a sharp curve. The road ahead appears to be relatively straight as it extends into the distance, with vehicles positioned in a straight line suggesting the path does not have a sharp bend. The lane markings also indicate a straightforward path rather than a sharp turn.
