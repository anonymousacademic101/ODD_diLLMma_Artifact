The road in the image appears to be relatively straight in the visible stretch. There is no evidence of a sharp curve within the field of view presented in the photograph. The traffic lanes, as indicated by the positioning of the vehicles and the streetcar tracks, suggest that the road continues straight ahead rather than curving sharply.
