The road does bend, but the term "sharp curve" typically implies a more abrupt change in direction. This road appears to curve more gently, and the vehicles are not positioned or oriented as if navigating a sharp curve. Instead, it seems to be a broad, sweeping curve typical of urban roadways designed to accommodate vehicle and pedestrian traffic.
