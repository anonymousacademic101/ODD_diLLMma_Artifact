A sharp curve would be indicated by a considerably more acute bend in the road, often with warning signs or signals indicating the need for a significant reduction in speed. This road looks like a gentle curve that can typically be navigated at moderate speeds without any sudden or severe steering adjustments.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
