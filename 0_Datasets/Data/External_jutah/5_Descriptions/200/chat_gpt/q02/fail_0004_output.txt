NO.

The road ahead appears to be fairly straight with a slight bend to the right, not a sharp curve. We can tell because if you follow the road markings and the orientation of the vehicles on the road, you can see that the path remains mostly straightforward, with only a mild divergence rather than a tight or sharp curve.
