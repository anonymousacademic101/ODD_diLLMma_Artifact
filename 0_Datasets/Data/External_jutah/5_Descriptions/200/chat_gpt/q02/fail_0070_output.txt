The road in the image seems to lead into an ordinary intersection rather than presenting a sharp curve. There is a left turn shown by a traffic light with a green left turn arrow, but the road itself does not exhibit any sharp curvature immediately visible in the image. It appears to be a typical urban street layout with perpendicular intersections.
