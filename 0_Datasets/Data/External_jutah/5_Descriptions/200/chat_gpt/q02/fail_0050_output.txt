NO.

The road in the image does not appear to be on a sharp curve, but rather it seems to be a straight section of an urban street that is undergoing construction. The orange and white barriers, cones, and construction signage suggest road work is in progress, and the vehicles are aligned in a straight manner, in line with the direction of the street. Additionally, the buildings along the side of the street have a linear orientation, which typically aligns with the street layout, reinforcing the perception that this is not a sharp curve.
