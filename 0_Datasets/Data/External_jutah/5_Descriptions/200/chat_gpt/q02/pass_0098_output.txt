NO.

The road visible in the image does not show a sharp curve; it seems to be a rather straight section of a highway with only a slight bend in the distance. The vehicles are not positioned or angled in a way that would indicate making a sharp turn, and the road lines also lead straight ahead without any sharp deviation.
