NO.

The image depicts a road with a visible curve ahead, but it does not appear to be a "sharp" curve. The curve is gentle and seems to be part of a normal thoroughfare through an urban area with traffic signals and multiple lanes. Sharp curves usually require significant steering adjustments, often accompanied by warning signs, neither of which are apparent in the image provided.
