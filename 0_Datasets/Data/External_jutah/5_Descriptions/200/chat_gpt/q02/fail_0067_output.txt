NO.

The road shown in the image appears to be relatively straight in the portion that is visible. There is no indication of a sharp curve directly ahead, as the road seems to continue straight between the buildings. A sharp curve would typically show a significant and abrupt change in direction within a short distance, which is not present in this image.
