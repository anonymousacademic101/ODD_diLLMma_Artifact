The orange and white barriers, cones, and construction signage suggest road work is in progress, and the vehicles are aligned in a straight manner, in line with the direction of the street. Additionally, the buildings along the side of the street have a linear orientation, which typically aligns with the street layout, reinforcing the perception that this is not a sharp curve.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
