NO

The road we are looking at in the image is not a sharp curve. It appears to be a straight section of a city street at an intersection, with traffic lights indicating a crosswalk. Roads at intersections like this may lead to a curved path beyond the visible area, but the visible portion itself is not a sharp curve.
