NO.

Based on the image provided, we cannot definitively determine if the road is on a sharp curve. The vehicles appear to be aligned in a straight manner, and there are no visible signs indicating a sharp bend. We can only see the section of the road that is within the tunnel, and it does not show a curve. However, without seeing beyond this tunnel section, we cannot determine the curvature of the road outside of what is visible in the photo.
