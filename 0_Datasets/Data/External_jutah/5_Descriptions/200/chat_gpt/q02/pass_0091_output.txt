NO

The road shown in the image appears to be relatively straight where the vehicles are positioned. There are no visible signs of a sharp curve in the immediate section of the road captured in the photo. The lanes and angles of the cars suggest that traffic is moving along a straight path, and the arrangement of the surrounding environment reinforces the same.
