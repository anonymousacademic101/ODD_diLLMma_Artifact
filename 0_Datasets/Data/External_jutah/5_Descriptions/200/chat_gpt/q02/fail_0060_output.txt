The road visible in the image does not appear to be a sharp curve. It looks like a straight section of urban street with intersections, as can be inferred from the layout of the crosswalks, traffic lights, and the straight path of the visible road markings. The image shows a typical city street grid which is generally characterized by straight stretches of road at right angles or intersections, rather than curves.
