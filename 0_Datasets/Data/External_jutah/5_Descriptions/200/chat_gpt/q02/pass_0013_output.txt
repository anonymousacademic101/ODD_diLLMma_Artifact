NO.

The road in the image appears to be gently curving rather than being on a sharp curve. The bend in the road does not suggest an immediate sharp turn but rather a slight curve to the left. The road markings and the layout of the surrounding environment indicate that vehicles would not need to significantly adjust speed or direction as might be required on a sharp curve.
