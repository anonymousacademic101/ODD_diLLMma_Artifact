NO.

The image shows a road that appears to run straight into an intersection, not presenting a sharp curve. Traffic signals are visible ahead, and vehicles are positioned on the road in a way that suggests they are either stopped at a traffic light or moving straight through the intersection. The lines on the road also indicate a straightforward path rather than a sharp turn.
