NO.

The road visible in the image does not exhibit a sharp curve; it appears to continue straight ahead beyond the area framed in the photo. There are no visible signs or road markings that indicate an immediate sharp turn, and the visual perspective of the street as well as the positioning of traffic signs and signals suggest the road remains relatively straight in the area shown.
