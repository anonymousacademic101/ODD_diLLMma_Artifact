The bend is wide and the curvature gradual, providing drivers with good visibility ahead and a smooth driving path. Sharp curves are typically characterized by a more abrupt change in direction, which can reduce visibility and require slower speeds to navigate safely. This road allows for a steady driving line without the need for significant steering adjustments.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
