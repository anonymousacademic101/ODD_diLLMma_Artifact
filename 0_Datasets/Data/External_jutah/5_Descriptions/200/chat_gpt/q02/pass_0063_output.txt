NO.

The road ahead does not appear to have a sharp curve. It seems to be a gentle curve or bend in the road. Sharp curves tend to have more dramatic changes in direction, often accompanied by warning signs or signals, which are not visible in this image. The flow of traffic indicates a more gradual turn rather than a sharp one.
