The road in view does not appear to be a sharp curve. It seems to be a relatively straight section of a street in an urban area with a slight bend or a gentle curve at most. The road is lined with checkered bollards and in the background there are buildings, a monument, and pedestrian areas, indicating it is a city environment with regular street geometry rather than a sharp curved road such as those found in mountainous or rural areas.
