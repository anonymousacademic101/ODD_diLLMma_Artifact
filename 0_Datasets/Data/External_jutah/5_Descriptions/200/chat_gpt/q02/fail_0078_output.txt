NO.

The road ahead appears to maneuver gently to the left rather than forming a sharp curve. The warning sign indicates a slight bend, not a sharp turn, and the visible lane markings and the position of the vehicles suggest a smooth, gradual change in direction. Additionally, the vehicles are not angled sharply, which would be expected if negotiating a tighter curve.
