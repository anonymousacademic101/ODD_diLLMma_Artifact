NO

The road visible in the image is not on a sharp curve. It appears to be relatively straight with a slight bend to the right in the distance, which is typical of urban street intersections but does not constitute a sharp curve. It also appears to have multiple lanes and is controlled by traffic signals, emphasizing the urban, grid-like road structure rather than windy, curvy roads.
