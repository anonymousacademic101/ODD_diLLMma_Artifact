The image provided does not depict the road that we are driving on directly, instead, it shows a view of an intersection with buildings, a traffic light with a green arrow indicating a permitted right turn, and pedestrian activity. Therefore, it cannot be determined from this image if the road we are driving on is a sharp curve. The traffic signal indicates a direction of travel, but the curvature of the road is not visible.
