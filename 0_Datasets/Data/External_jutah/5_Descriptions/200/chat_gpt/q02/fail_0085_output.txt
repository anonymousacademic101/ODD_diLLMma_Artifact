The indication that the road we are driving on is a sharp curve comes from the traffic sign visible in the image. The sign specifically displays a sharp curve arrow, which is a warning sign meant to alert drivers of an approaching curve where the road bends sharply. The sign is designed to caution drivers to reduce speed and prepare for the change in direction.
