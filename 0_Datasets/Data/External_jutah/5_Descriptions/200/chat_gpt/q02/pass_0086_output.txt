NO.

The road ahead does not display a sharp curve based on the visible road layout. The signs hanging above the road, which suggest a sharp curve, are actually indicating a pedestrian crossing with a curved arrow pointing downwards, implying that cars must stop for pedestrians at the crossing rather than suggesting that the road itself curves sharply. The actual road appears to continue straight ahead from the perspective given in the image.
