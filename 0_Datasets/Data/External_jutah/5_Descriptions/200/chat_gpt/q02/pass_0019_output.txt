The road in the image appears to be relatively straight with only a slight curve in the distance, not a sharp curve. The lane markings and the arrangement of the vehicles on the road suggest that the road is not experiencing a sharp turn at this point. Sharp curves are typically indicated by more pronounced changes in direction and usually require signage to warn drivers.
