The image shows a view of a road approaching a red traffic light at an intersection. There are no visible signs of a sharp curve in the road within the frame of the image; instead, the road appears to continue straight ahead beyond the intersection. The visible lane markings on the road support the interpretation that the road is not curving sharply at this point.
