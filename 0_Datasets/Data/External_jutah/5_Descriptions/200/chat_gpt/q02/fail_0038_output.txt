NO.

The road visible in the image, while not entirely straight, does not exhibit the characteristics of a sharp curve. Rather, it gently curves to the left, with a wide radius that allows for a smooth transition rather than a sharp turn. The sightline appears to be clear, and the curve is gradual, which is not typically considered "sharp" in roadway designations.
