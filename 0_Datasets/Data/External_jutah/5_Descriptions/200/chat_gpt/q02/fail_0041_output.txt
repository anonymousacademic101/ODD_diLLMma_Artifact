NO.

The road in the image appears to be relatively straight with a slight bend to the left in the distance. A sharp curve would imply a much more significant and immediate change in the road's direction than what is depicted here. The visible lane markings and the position of the traffic lights suggest a standard intersection rather than a sharp curve.
