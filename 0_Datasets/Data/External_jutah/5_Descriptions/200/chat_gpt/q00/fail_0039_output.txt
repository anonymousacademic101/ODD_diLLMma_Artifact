The visibility in the image is not impeded by heavy rain, snow, fog, or other adverse weather conditions. The image shows a clear view of an abandoned building with overgrown foliage, and there is no visible precipitation or fog that would decrease visibility. There are some puddles on the ground, which may indicate recent rain, but the current conditions in the photo allow for good visibility.
