YES

This image shows conditions with rain, as evidenced by the wet road surfaces, raindrops visible on the camera lens or window through which the photo was taken, and the presence of umbrellas being used by pedestrians. These factors indicate that there's active rainfall, which can lead to reduced visibility and require more cautious behavior while driving or walking outdoors. The visibility is not extremely poor, but it is indeed affected by the weather conditions presented in the photograph.
