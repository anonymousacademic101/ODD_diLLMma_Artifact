The visibility in the image does not seem to be heavily impaired by conditions like heavy rain, snow, or thick fog. The overall clarity suggests that while the sky is overcast, and there may be some atmospheric moisture, the ability to see objects at a distance is not significantly affected by severe weather conditions. There are clouds in the sky and some emissions from the industrial structures, but these do not significantly reduce visibility on the road or surroundings.
