YES

The image shows wet surfaces, standing water on the roads, and a general overcast atmosphere, which implies recent or ongoing rain. While it's not heavy rain, given the visible droplets on the camera lens and the gray sky, there is likely reduced visibility due to the weather conditions. Nonetheless, objects and buildings are still reasonably clear, and the adverse weather does not seem to be severe at the moment the photo was taken.
