NO.

The image presented is of a well-lit tunnel, with no signs of poor visibility due to heavy rain, snow, fog, or adverse weather conditions. Visibility issues typically do not arise within tunnels as the enclosed environment protects from external weather. The lighting within this tunnel is bright, and although there is motion blur suggesting movement, this does not equate to reduced visibility from weather conditions.
