The image shows wet road surfaces, reflections on the pavement, and a general dampness that suggests recent or ongoing rain. The visibility appears moderately reduced due to the weather conditions, as evidenced by the gloss on the streets and the dreary sky, which are signs of rainfall. However, objects are still identifiable at a distance, indicating that while visibility may be somewhat compromised, it's not heavily obstructed.
