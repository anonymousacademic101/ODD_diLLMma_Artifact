The image depicts an urban environment at nighttime, and while it's not completely clear due to the nighttime setting, there are no obvious signs of heavy rain, snow, fog, or other adverse weather conditions that would significantly reduce visibility. The street lights and vehicle lights are clear and not diffused as they would be in fog or heavy precipitation. The traffic signals and road markings are also clearly visible.
