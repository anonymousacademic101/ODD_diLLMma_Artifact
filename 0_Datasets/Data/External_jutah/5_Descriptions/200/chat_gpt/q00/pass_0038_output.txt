The image shows wet road surfaces and reflections of vehicle lights, indicating recent or ongoing rain. The overcast sky suggests that the lighting conditions are not ideal, although it's not severe enough to significantly impair visibility. There's no heavy rain, snow, or fog actively blocking the view in the scene, but the damp and overcast conditions can still affect visibility to some degree.
