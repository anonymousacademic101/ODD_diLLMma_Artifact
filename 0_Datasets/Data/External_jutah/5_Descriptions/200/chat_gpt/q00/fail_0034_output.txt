YES

Although the visibility is not extremely poor, there is evidence of rain in the image, which can impair visibility to some extent. The wet surfaces, reflections on the pavement, and the overall gray sky suggest it is either raining or has just rained. While the image is clear enough to see the details of the scene, in real-world conditions, rain can make visibility poorer, especially if it becomes heavier.
