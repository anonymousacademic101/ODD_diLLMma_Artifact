NO.

The image does not show any evidence of poor visibility due to heavy rain, snow, fog, or adverse weather conditions. It appears to be taken at nighttime with artificial lighting from street lamps and vehicles, which illuminates the scene adequately. There are clear reflections on the road indicating it might have rained previously, but there is no active precipitation or fog obscuring the view. Visibility appears to be fair for a nighttime urban setting.
