NO.

The road in the image appears to be an urban street rather than an on-off ramp. There are parked cars along the curb, which is typical for city streets but not for highway ramps. Additionally, the presence of buildings directly adjacent to the road, the absence of signage that is characteristic for highway on-off ramps, and the overall city environment suggest this is a regular street.
