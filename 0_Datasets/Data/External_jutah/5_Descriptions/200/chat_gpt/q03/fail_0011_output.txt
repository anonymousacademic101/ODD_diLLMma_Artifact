NO.

We are not driving on an on-off ramp. The road depicted in the image is a highway with multiple lanes and a divider, typical of a coastal or scenic route rather than a transitional ramp connecting highways or facilitating access to local roads. The environment lacks the signage, merging lanes, and sharp curves characteristic of on-off ramps.
