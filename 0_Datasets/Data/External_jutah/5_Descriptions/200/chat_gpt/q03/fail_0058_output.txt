The image shows a city street intersection with traffic lights, crosswalks, parked cars, and buildings closely surrounding the area. On-off ramps typically connect highways to local roads and wouldn't have these features, especially not traffic signals directly at the end of the ramp or parking spaces along the side. This setting is indicative of a regular city street, not an on-off ramp.
