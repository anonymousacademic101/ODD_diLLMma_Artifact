It seems to be a regular urban/suburban roadway with multiple lanes and a traffic signal at an intersection. On-off ramps are typically associated with highways or freeways and are used to enter or exit these roads. The presence of a traffic signal, businesses, and regular cross-street intersections indicates that this is not an on-off ramp but rather a standard surface street with controlled intersections.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
