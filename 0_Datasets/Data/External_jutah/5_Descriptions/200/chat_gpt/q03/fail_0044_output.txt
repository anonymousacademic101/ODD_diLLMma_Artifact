The traffic lights, buildings, pedestrian crossings, and signage in the image indicate that this is an urban street rather than an on-off ramp, which typically connects highways to local roads and would not have the features present in this environment. On-off ramps usually lack traffic signals, have more limited access, and often have signs indicating the speed limit for entering or exiting a freeway, none of which are visible in this image.
