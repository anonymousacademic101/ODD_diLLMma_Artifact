Rather, it seems to be a freeway or a multi-lane divided road with traffic moving in both directions, as there is a concrete barrier dividing the lanes and multiple lanes for traffic. On-off ramps typically have a single lane or at most two lanes and are designed for vehicles to either enter or exit a freeway, whereas this road accommodates through traffic and does not show any merging or diverging patterns that are characteristic of on-off ramps.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
