The image shows a regular city street with traffic lights, crosswalks, and multiple lanes for cars, indicating that it's an urban road rather than a ramp connecting highways or a freeway. Additionally, there are buildings directly adjacent to the road, which is typical for city streets rather than on-off ramps, which generally do not have direct building access. On-off ramps typically have signs indicating the entrance or exit to a highway, and there are no such signs visible in this image."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
