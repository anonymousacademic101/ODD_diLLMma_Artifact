NO.

This does not appear to be an on-off ramp. It looks more like a regular road with a roundabout or traffic circle, as indicated by the curved arrows on the "ONE WAY" sign and the presence of residential housing, pedestrians, and cyclists. On-off ramps typically connect highways to local roads and do not have roundabouts or such mixed traffic.
