The road in the image does not resemble a typical on-off ramp. On-off ramps are usually associated with highway systems and they facilitate the transition between high-speed roadways and local roads. This road appears to pass through an urban area with multiple lanes and access to local buildings, which indicates it is a regular city street rather than a ramp designed for entering or exiting a freeway or highway. It is also marked with pedestrian crosswalk lines, which are not commonly found on highway ramps, further supporting the conclusion that it is not an on-off ramp.
