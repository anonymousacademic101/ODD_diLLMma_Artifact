The scene in the image shows a pedestrian crosswalk, which typically indicates an urban street rather than an on-off ramp to a highway. The presence of storefronts like Louis Vuitton, a church, pedestrian traffic signals, and crosswalk markings all suggest this is an intersection in a city setting instead of an on-off ramp, which wouldn't have these urban features and pedestrian elements.
