NO

The road depicted in the image is not an on-off ramp. It appears to be a regular city street under an elevated train track structure, also known as an "El" or "L" in some cities. There are common urban features present like storefronts, street-level traffic lights, pedestrian crosswalks, and signage that suggest it is a standard street rather than a highway interchange or on-off ramp. On-off ramps typically don't have direct access to shops and have different traffic control devices.
