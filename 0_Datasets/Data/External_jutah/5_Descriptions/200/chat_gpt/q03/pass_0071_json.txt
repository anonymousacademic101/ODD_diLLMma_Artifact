Firstly, the road has a dedicated lane for decelerating vehicles that is separated by a solid white line, which implies it could be an exit ramp from a highway. Secondly, the signage such as the yellow merge sign suggests the merging of traffic, typical for on-off ramps. Lastly, the absence of intersections and the curvature of the road also align with the characteristics of on-off ramps used for entering or exiting highways or major roads.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
