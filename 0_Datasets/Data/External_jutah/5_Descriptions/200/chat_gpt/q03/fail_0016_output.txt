NO.

The road visible in the image does not appear to be an on-off ramp. It seems to be an urban street intersection, as indicated by the presence of buildings directly beside the road, street-level traffic signals, a crosswalk, parking spaces, and a variety of businesses with storefronts. On-off ramps typically connect freeways or highways to local roads and do not have such features.
