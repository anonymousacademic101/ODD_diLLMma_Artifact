NO.

The road in the image does not appear to be an on-off ramp. On-off ramps are typically single lanes diverging from or merging onto a main freeway, designed for vehicles to enter or exit the freeway. In contrast, the road we're looking at has multiple lanes and is moving straight with no evident signs of diverging or merging. Furthermore, the overhead green sign is for a highway or route marker, which commonly indicates a main thoroughfare rather than an on-off ramp.
