On-off ramps are typically associated with access to highways or freeways and are often characterized by merging lanes and clear signage directing traffic to enter or exit a major road. The image shows a road with multiple lanes and what appears to be a traffic light ahead, suggesting a more typical arterial or secondary road suitable for various kinds of destinations. The presence of traffic signals, regular spacing of trees, and other signs along the road (seen on the right) indicate that this is likely not a highway on-off ramp.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
