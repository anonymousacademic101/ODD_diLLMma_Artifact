The characteristics of the road, such as visible driveways, buildings directly adjacent to the street, and the lack of signage typically associated with highway ramps, suggest it is not designed for freeway access but rather for local traffic. On-off ramps usually have specific design features to handle the higher speeds and traffic flow patterns of entering or exiting a freeway, such as dedicated acceleration and deceleration lanes, which are not evident here.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
