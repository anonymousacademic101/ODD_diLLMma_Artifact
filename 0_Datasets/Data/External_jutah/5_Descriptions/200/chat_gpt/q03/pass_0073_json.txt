There are buildings lining the road, along with typical urban infrastructure like street lights and signage. This environment does not resemble that of an on-off ramp, which typically connects highways to local roads and would not have pedestrian foot traffic or buildings directly adjacent to the roadway in the manner depicted. An on-off ramp would also have distinct signage and lane markings that are not present in the image provided.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
