NO.

The road shown in the image is not an on-off ramp. The visual cues indicating that it is not an on-off ramp include parked cars along the side of the road, a city bus in the right-hand lane, and buildings directly adjacent to the street. On-off ramps typically do not have parked vehicles or allow for public transportation stops, as they are designed to facilitate vehicles entering or exiting highways and do not have direct building access or pedestrian areas.
