On-off ramps usually have clear indications of merging or diverging traffic, yield or merge signs, acceleration or deceleration lanes, and they typically connect highways to other roads. The street in the image appears to be a standard city street surrounded by buildings, and it lacks the features that would classify it as an on-off ramp.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
