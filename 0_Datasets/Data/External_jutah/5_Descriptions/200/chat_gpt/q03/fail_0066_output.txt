NO.

The road we are on appears to be an urban street rather than an on-off ramp. There are multiple lanes with traffic lights, pedestrian crossings, and buildings close to the roadside, which are characteristic of city streets. Additionally, there is a sign for 38th St and Market St, implying it's an intersection in an urban area, not a highway interchange.
