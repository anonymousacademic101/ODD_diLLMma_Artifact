The road appears to be near an entrance to a ferry terminal or transportation hub, given the signs for Battery Park, Ellis Island, and the Statue of Liberty Ferries, and the dense pedestrian traffic. On-off ramps generally serve to facilitate the transition between different levels of roadway, such as from surface streets to a freeway or highway, and do not usually accommodate pedestrian crossings directly."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
