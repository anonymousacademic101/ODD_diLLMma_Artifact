The image shows what appears to be a regular intersection controlled by traffic signals, not an on-off ramp. On-off ramps are typically associated with highways or freeways and do not usually have traffic signals or cross-traffic as seen in this image. Additionally, the signage in the image is indicative of a regular city street or urban road environment rather than a highway interchange.
