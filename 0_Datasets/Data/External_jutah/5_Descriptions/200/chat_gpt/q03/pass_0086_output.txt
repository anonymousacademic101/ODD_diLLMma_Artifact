NO.

The road in the image does not appear to be an on-off ramp. On-off ramps are typically connected to highways or freeways and are designed to allow vehicles to enter or exit the main roadway. In this image, we see traffic signals and signs indicating pedestrian crossings, which are characteristic of urban or suburban roads rather than highway ramps. Furthermore, the presence of buildings and palm trees close to the road, a crosswalk, and multiple lanes with vehicles traveling at what seems to be slower speeds suggest that this is a regular street and not a ramp designed for highway access or egress.
