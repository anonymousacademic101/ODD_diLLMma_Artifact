It appears to be a regular urban street with multiple lanes, parallel parked cars, traffic signals, and buildings close to the street, which suggests that it is within a city or densely populated area rather than being a ramp that connects to a higher-speed freeway or highway. On-off ramps typically do not have features such as traffic lights and direct building frontage.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
