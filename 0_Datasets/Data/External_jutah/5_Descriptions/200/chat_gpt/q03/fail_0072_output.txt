The road ahead is marked with "DO NOT ENTER" and "ONE WAY" signs indicating that it is a one-way street exiting in the opposite direction. In other words, it is an off-ramp from a parking or roadway facility, but it is not meant for entering, which means you are facing the exit of the ramp, not the entrance.
