The road in the image does not appear to be an on-off ramp. It seems to be a main roadway or highway with multiple lanes of traffic. On-off ramps typically are single-lane roads branching off from a highway for vehicles to enter or exit the highway, and they often have distinct curvatures or inclines to facilitate the transition to or from the highway speed. In the image provided, the road is multilane without the characteristic curvature of an on-off ramp, and there are no evident signs or markings indicating it as an on-off ramp.
