The road in the image does not appear to be an on-off ramp. It looks like an urban street with multiple lanes, traffic lights, and parked cars along the sides. On-off ramps typically have different characteristics, such as leading to or from highways without intersecting cross-streets or traffic signals, and they don't usually have parked cars along them.
