NO.

This does not appear to be an on-off ramp. The setting in the image looks like an urban intersection with traffic lights and multiple lanes, which are typical of city streets rather than highway ramps. On-off ramps usually connect highways to local roads and do not feature traffic lights as integrated parts of the ramp itself. Additionally, the presence of street signs for what appears to be "Jefferson" suggests this is a regular city street rather than a highway ramp.
