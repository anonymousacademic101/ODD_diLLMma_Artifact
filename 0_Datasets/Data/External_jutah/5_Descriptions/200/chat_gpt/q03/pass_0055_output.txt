NO.

The road in the image appears to be a multi-lane urban road, as indicated by multiple traffic lanes, traffic lights, and commercial signs on both sides of the road. There is also no evident curve or ramp structure that would imply an on-ramp or off-ramp scenario typically associated with highways or freeways. The vehicles are stopped at a traffic signal, which further indicates that this is a regular intersection rather than an on-off ramp, where traffic signals are less common.
