The road appears to be a one-way city street, not an on-off ramp. This is indicated by the presence of traffic lights, a one-way sign on the road, buildings directly adjacent to the street, and other elements typical of an urban street rather than a highway interchange. Additionally, there is construction and traffic control equipment present that is typical for city roadwork rather than highway ramps.
