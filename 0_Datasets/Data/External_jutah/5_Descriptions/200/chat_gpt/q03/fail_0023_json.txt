There are regular traffic signals visible, buildings directly adjacent to the road, and no signs that typically mark the beginning or end of an on-off ramp, such as arrows indicating merging traffic or yield signs. On-off ramps are generally connected to highways or interstates to facilitate the transition of vehicles on and off the main roadway, and they usually have different design characteristics than urban streets, including the absence of crosswalks, traffic lights, and direct access to commercial buildings, which are all present in this image.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
