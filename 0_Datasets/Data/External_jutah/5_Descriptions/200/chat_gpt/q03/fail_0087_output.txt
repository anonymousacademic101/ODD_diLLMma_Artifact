NO.

The image shows a traffic signal and crosswalk typical of urban road settings, not an on-off ramp. Pedestrians are walking on the sidewalk, and there are buildings directly adjacent to the road, indicating that this is a city street rather than a freeway access ramp. On-off ramps typically have a different design, often with signs indicating the direction of the freeway and no signals or crosswalks as they are not meant for pedestrian crossing or standard urban traffic control.
