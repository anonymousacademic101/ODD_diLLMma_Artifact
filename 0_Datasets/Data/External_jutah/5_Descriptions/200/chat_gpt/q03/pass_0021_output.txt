NO.

The image shows a multi-lane urban street intersection with various traffic signs, signals, and marked lanes. There's also a "NO TURNS EXCEPT BUSES" sign, indicating that typical turning maneuvers are restricted at this intersection. On-off ramps are typically associated with highways or freeways to allow vehicles to enter or exit at specific points. The environment in the image suggests a regular urban street rather than an on-off ramp which usually has a different design, generally without intersections and traffic lights as seen here.
