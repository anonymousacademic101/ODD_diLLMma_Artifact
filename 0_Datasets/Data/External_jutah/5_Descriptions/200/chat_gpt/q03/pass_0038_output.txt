NO.

The road depicted in the image is not an on-off ramp. It has multiple lanes with traffic signals, pedestrian crosswalks, and is in an urban setting with buildings around, which indicates that this is a regular city street intersection, not a highway ramp that is typically designed for vehicles to enter or exit a freeway and does not have traffic signals controlling flow onto the freeway. Additionally, the presence of traffic lights and crosswalks at this location is not characteristic of on-off ramps, which usually connect directly to highways without intersections controlled by traffic signals.
