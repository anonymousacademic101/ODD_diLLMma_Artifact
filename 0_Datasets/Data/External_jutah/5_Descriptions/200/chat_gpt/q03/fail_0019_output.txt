NO.

The road does not appear to be an on-off ramp. Instead, it looks like a regular intersection with a railway crossing. The presence of railway crossing arms, warning lights, and a crossbuck sign indicate that this is a place where a road crosses a railway track at grade, not an on-off ramp for a highway or freeway. Additionally, there are street signs for "Green Bay Rd" and "UTAH", which are more indicative of a standard intersection within a city or town rather than a ramp connecting to a highway.
