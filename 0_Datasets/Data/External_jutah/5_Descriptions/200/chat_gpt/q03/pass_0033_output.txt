NO.

The road in the image is not an on-off ramp. It seems to be a regular multi-lane urban road with traffic signals, businesses, and other typical roadside infrastructure. On-off ramps usually connect highways or freeways to local roads and typically do not have crosswalks, traffic signals, or direct access to businesses, as seen in the image.
