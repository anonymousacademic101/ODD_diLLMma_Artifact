The presence of traffic cones and construction signage may indicate road work or a temporary traffic pattern, but nothing specific to an on-off ramp scenario is evident here. The buildings in the background and the lack of highway infrastructure further support this observation.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
