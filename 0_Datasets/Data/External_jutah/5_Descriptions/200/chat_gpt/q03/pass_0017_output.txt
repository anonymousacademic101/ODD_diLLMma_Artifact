NO.

This road does not appear to be an on-off ramp. On-off ramps typically connect highways or freeways to local roads, and they often have a curved design to manage the transition between high-speed and low-speed traffic. The road in the image appears to be a straight urban street with multiple lanes, parking spots, pedestrian crossings, and surrounded by buildings, which is consistent with a city street rather than a highway on-off ramp.
