NO.

The road in the image does not have the typical characteristics of an on-off ramp. On-off ramps are usually connected to highways or freeways to allow vehicles to enter or exit. They often feature acceleration and deceleration lanes, signage indicating the directions to the connected roads, and are designed for higher-speed vehicular traffic.

The road shown is adjacent to a dilapidated industrial or warehouse building and appears to be a regular urban or rural street lacking the infrastructure or design indicative of an on-off ramp. Additionally, there are no visible signs of it leading to or from a highway, and it looks neglected, with weeds growing through the cracks and no apparent traffic flow.
