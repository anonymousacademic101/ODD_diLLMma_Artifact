On-off ramps typically have fewer lanes and are designed for vehicles to exit or enter highways, featuring sharper curves or bends leading to or from the primary roadway, none of which are visible in this image. The road displayed here is straight with multiple travel lanes, consistent with a highway rather than an on-off ramp.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
