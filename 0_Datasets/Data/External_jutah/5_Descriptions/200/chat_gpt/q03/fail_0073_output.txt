The road we are driving on does not appear to be an on-off ramp. The features visible in the image, such as traffic lights, pedestrian crossings, and intersections, indicate that this is an urban street rather than an on-off ramp which typically connects highways or freeways to local roads and usually does not include traffic signals or complex intersections like the one shown.
