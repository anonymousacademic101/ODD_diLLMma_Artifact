The image shows a city street intersection, not an on-off ramp. On-off ramps are typically associated with highways or freeways and facilitate the transition between high-speed throughways and the arterial road network. The environment in the image is an urban setting with buildings, pedestrian crossings, and traffic signals, which are indicative of regular city roadways rather than highway ramps.
