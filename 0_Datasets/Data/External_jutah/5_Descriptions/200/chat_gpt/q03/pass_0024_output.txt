NO.

The road depicted in the image does not appear to be an on-off ramp. On-off ramps are typically associated with highways or freeways and are designed to allow vehicles to enter and exit at points where the highway intersects with other roads. This road seems to be a regular city street or a downtown avenue due to the presence of buildings with storefronts, pedestrian crosswalks, street parking, and a landscaped median. These features are not characteristic of highway on-off ramps, which generally lack direct pedestrian access and amenities like street parking.
