On-off ramps are designed to provide access from local roads to highways or freeways and typically do not include crosswalks and traffic signals within the ramp area. The presence of buildings directly adjacent to the roadway, businesses at street level, and the full traffic signal setup indicates that this is a regular street within a city, not an on-off ramp.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
