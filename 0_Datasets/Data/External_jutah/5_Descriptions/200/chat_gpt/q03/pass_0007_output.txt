NO.

The road in the image appears to be a regular city street rather than an on-off ramp. On-off ramps generally connect highways to local roads and usually don't have crosswalks, traffic lights, or intersections like the ones visible in the image. This road has multiple lanes, traffic signals for both vehicles and pedestrians, and buildings along the side, which are typical features of urban streets.
