NO.

The image shows a road intersection with traffic lights, signage for directions to Interstate 90 (west and east), and a railroad bridge overhead. The road the viewer is on does not appear to be an on-off ramp but rather a surface street approaching a junction where drivers can access the on-off ramps to the interstate highway. An on-off ramp typically does not have intersections with traffic lights as this setup is intended for transferring vehicles between highway speeds and local road speeds.
