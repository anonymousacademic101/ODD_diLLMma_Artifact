NO.

The area depicted in the image appears to be an urban street intersection, not an on-off ramp. On-off ramps typically connect highways to local roads and have specific designs, such as curved lanes for merging and exiting traffic at higher speeds. This location shows a straight road with traffic signals, pedestrian crossings, and buildings right up to the sidewalks, which are common characteristics of city streets, not highway ramps.
