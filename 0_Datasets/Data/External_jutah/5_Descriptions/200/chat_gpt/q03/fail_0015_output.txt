NO.

In the image provided, it appears to be an ordinary city street intersection rather than an on-off ramp. There are buildings directly on the roadside, standard traffic signals, pedestrian walkways, and no visible signage or lane design that would indicate an on-ramp or off-ramp associated with a highway or freeway. Additionally, there's a "ROAD CLOSED" sign indicating construction activity, which is typical for city streets rather than highway ramps.
