On-off ramps are usually designed to connect highways or major roads with other roads and often feature curved paths or inclines to accommodate acceleration or deceleration of vehicles as they enter or exit the main roadways. In contrast, this road appears to be an urban street at a regular intersection with traffic lights, without the design elements specific to an on-off ramp, such as merging lanes or limited access.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
