There are multiple lanes of traffic, a variety of vehicles, including typical passenger cars, and buildings closely flanking the road. On-off ramps typically connect highways/expressways to local roads, often with fewer lanes and less surrounding infrastructure such as storefronts and street lighting as seen here. Moreover, on-off ramps usually do not have pedestrian facilities like the one visible on the right, and there's generally signage specific to highway entrance and exit which is not evident here."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
