The road does not appear to be an on-off ramp. It looks like an urban street with multiple lanes, parallel parking on the side, and buildings directly adjacent to the roadway. On-off ramps typically do not have these features and are designed to connect highways with local roads, often without direct access to buildings or parking from the ramp itself.
