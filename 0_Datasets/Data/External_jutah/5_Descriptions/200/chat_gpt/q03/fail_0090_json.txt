Instead, it seems to be a regular city street with multiple lanes and green marking for what seems to be a bike lane on the right side. There are palm trees and a park-like setting on both sides of the street, which is typical for scenic drives or boulevards in urban areas. Additionally, the road has a relatively straight layout without the curvature typical of on-ramps or off-ramps.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
