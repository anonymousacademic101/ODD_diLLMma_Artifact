The scene in the image shows a regular city street at night, which has multiple lanes and a crosswalk, indicated by pedestrian signage and traffic signals. The presence of traffic signals and strict lane demarcations, as well as the urban setting with buildings close to the road, suggests that this is not an on-off ramp, which typically facilitates the transition between high-speed highways and local roads and would not have pedestrian crossings or such close proximity to pedestrian-accessible areas.
