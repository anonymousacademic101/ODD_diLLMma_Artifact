On-off ramps typically connect major highways or freeways to local roads and don't have storefronts directly on the side like in an urban setting as shown here. Additionally, the presence of construction barriers and regular traffic signal signs further indicates this is not an on-off ramp, but rather a standard city street undergoing some form of construction or roadwork."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
