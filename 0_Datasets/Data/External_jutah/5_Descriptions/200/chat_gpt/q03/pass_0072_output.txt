The road in the image appears to be an urban street passing through a downtown area, not an on-off ramp. On-off ramps are typically associated with highways or freeways and are designed for vehicles to enter or exit those roadways. In contrast, the road in the photograph is lined with buildings, traffic signals, and other features characteristic of city driving environments.
