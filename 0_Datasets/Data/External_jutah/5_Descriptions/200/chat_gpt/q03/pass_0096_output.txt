NO.

The road shown in the image appears to be a regular city street rather than an on-off ramp. There are multiple lanes of traffic, a variety of vehicles, including typical passenger cars, and buildings closely flanking the road. On-off ramps typically connect highways/expressways to local roads, often with fewer lanes and less surrounding infrastructure such as storefronts and street lighting as seen here. Moreover, on-off ramps usually do not have pedestrian facilities like the one visible on the right, and there's generally signage specific to highway entrance and exit which is not evident here.
