The scene does not depict an on-off ramp commonly associated with highways or freeways. Instead, it appears to be a city street or entrance to a building complex, given the presence of a traffic signal, buildings directly adjacent to the road, and a crosswalk. On-off ramps typically do not have such features and are specifically designed to facilitate vehicles entering and exiting highways.
