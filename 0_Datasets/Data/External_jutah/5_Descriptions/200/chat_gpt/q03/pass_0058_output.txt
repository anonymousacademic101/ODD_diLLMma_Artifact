NO.

The road in the image appears to be a regular city street, not an on-off ramp. There are multiple lanes with traffic signals, and the environment is urban with buildings lining the streets, which is typical for city roads rather than highway access ramps. On-off ramps usually connect highways to local roads and typically do not have crosswalks, traffic signals for crossing traffic, or bus stops as seen in this image.
