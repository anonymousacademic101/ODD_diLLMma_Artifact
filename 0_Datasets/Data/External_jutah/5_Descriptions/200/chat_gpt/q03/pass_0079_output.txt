The road in the image does not appear to be an on-off ramp; it appears to be an urban street with multiple lanes, various street signs, and a speed limit sign indicating a speed limit of 40, which is typical for city streets rather than highway ramps. There are also businesses and buildings directly alongside the road, and on-off ramps typically do not have this level of immediate adjacent development.
