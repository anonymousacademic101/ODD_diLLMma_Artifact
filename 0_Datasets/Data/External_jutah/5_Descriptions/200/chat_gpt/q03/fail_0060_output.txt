NO.

The road in the image is not an on-off ramp; it appears to be a typical city street at an intersection with traffic signals, pedestrian crosswalks, and multiple lanes for vehicular traffic, which are not characteristic of on-off ramps. On-off ramps usually connect freeways to local roads and do not have intersections with traffic lights and crosswalks as seen in this image.
