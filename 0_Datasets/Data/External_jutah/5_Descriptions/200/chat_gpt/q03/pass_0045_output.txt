YES.

The road we are driving on appears to be an exit ramp off of a highway. This is indicated by several clues in the image: the curving road, the deceleration lane markings, the exit sign indicating the way to the 401 West, and the presence of adjacent main lanes of the highway to the left. These features are typical of an off-ramp from a highway designed to allow vehicles to leave the main travel lanes and transition to a connecting road or another highway.
