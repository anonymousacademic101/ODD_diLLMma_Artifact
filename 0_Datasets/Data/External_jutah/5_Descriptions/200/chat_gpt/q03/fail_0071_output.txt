NO.

The environment shown in the image does not have the typical characteristics of an on-off ramp. An on-off ramp generally refers to a road used to enter or exit a freeway or highway and is characterized by a dedicated lane that merges with or diverges from the main roadway. The image here shows a street scene with buildings, garage doors, a sidewalk, and barriers indicating construction or access limitations, which are not indicative of an on-off ramp. Instead, this looks like an urban street or alleyway possibly used for deliveries or services to the adjacent buildings.
