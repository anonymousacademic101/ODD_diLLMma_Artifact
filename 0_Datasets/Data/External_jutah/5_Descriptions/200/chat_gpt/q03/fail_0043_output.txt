This scene does not depict an on-off ramp. It looks to be an urban street with sidewalks, pedestrian areas, a traffic signal ahead, and urban infrastructure that includes buildings and signage often found in a downtown or city center environment. On-off ramps are typically associated with highways or freeways, featuring dedicated lanes for accelerating onto or decelerating off of the main travel lanes, with few if any pedestrian facilities or traffic signals.
