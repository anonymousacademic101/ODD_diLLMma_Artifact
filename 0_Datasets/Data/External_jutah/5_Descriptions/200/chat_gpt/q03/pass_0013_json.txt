There are multiple features that indicate this:\n\n1. There are residential or commercial buildings alongside the road, which is typical of a local road rather than a highway on-off ramp.\n2. The road has a solid yellow centerline, indicating a two-way street rather than the usual road markings found on highway ramps.\n3. There are also vehicles parked on the side of the road, suggesting that it is likely a local street.\n4. On-off ramps typically connect highways to local roads and do not have direct property access or parked vehicles along them.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
