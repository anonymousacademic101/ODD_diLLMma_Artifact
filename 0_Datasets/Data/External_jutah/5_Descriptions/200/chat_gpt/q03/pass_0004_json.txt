The road layout does not resemble a typical on-off ramp, which would facilitate the transition between a highway and local roads. Instead, this appears to be an ordinary street with accessibility to a bridge, indicated by the presence of traffic lights, crosswalks, and buildings closely surrounding the area. On-off ramps typically have different designs, lacking traffic lights and direct pedestrian crossings, as they are meant to handle vehicles entering or exiting at higher speeds.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
