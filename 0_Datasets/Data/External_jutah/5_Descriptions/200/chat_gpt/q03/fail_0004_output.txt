NO.

The road in the image does not appear to be an on-off ramp. It seems to be a regular city street intersection with traffic lights, crosswalks, and buildings closely surrounding the area. On-off ramps typically connect highways to local roads and usually do not have pedestrian crosswalks or traffic signals right at the end of the ramp.
