The presence of traffic signals and a cross street suggests it is a regular intersection rather than an on-off ramp, which typically wouldn't have such traffic lights and cross traffic at the same point. Furthermore, on-off ramps are generally linked to highways or freeways and are designed to facilitate vehicles entering or exiting at higher speeds, which does not appear to be the case in this setting."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
