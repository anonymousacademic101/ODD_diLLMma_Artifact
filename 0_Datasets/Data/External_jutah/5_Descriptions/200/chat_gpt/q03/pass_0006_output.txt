The image shows a road with multiple lanes and a posted speed limit sign of 35 mph, typically indicating that the road is a standard arterial road rather than an on-off ramp. On-off ramps typically connect freeway traffic to local roads and often have different design features, such as sharper curves and sometimes different speed limit postings to manage the transition between different road types. The road in the image does not display the characteristics commonly associated with on-off ramps.
