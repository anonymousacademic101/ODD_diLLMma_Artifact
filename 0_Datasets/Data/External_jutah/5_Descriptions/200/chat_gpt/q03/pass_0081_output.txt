NO.

This image shows a city street with multiple lanes of traffic, traffic lights, and buildings close to the roadside, which are typical features of an urban road rather than an on-off ramp. On-off ramps are typically connected to highways or freeways and don't have traffic lights or immediate adjacent buildings. They are designed for vehicles to enter or exit highways, not for urban traffic with pedestrian crossings and intersections.
