On-off ramps are typically associated with highways or freeways and are designed specifically for vehicles to enter or exit these roads. The presence of traffic lights, streetcar tracks, storefronts, pedestrian pathways, and a dense urban setting suggests that this is a city street rather than an on-off ramp, which would not have these features and would be more direct in facilitating the flow of vehicles to and from a faster-moving highway.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
