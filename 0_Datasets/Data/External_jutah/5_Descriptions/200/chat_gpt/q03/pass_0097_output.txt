NO

The road in the image does not appear to be an on-off ramp. It seems to be an urban multi-lane road with multiple lanes of traffic moving in the same direction. On-off ramps are typically associated with highways or freeways and are designed for vehicles to enter or exit these high-speed roads. In the image, buildings are directly adjacent to the roadway, and there are traffic signals and signage typical of city street settings, not characteristics of on-off ramps.
