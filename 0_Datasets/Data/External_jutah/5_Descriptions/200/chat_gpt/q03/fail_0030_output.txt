NO.

This image does not show an on-off ramp of a highway. Instead, it depicts an urban street intersection. There are traffic signals, crosswalks, and buildings close to the roadway, which are typical features of city streets rather than on-off ramps. On-off ramps usually have signage specifically for highway entrances or exits and lack traffic signals, as they are designed to facilitate the flow of vehicles onto or off of high-speed highways rather than manage intersection traffic in urban settings.
