NO.

The road in the image does not appear to be an on-off ramp. The setting looks like a typical residential street junction. There are houses, on-street parking, and a pedestrian crossing the street, which would not be characteristic of an on-off ramp connected to a highway or freeway. Furthermore, the "DO NOT ENTER" and "ONE WAY" signs suggest that this is an exit for a one-way street, not an on-off ramp.
