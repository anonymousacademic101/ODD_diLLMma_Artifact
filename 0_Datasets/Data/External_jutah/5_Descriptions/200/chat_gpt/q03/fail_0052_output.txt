NO.

The road in the image does not appear to be an on-off ramp. It looks like a street in an urban area with brick pavement, nearby buildings, pedestrians, and a large monument which is unusual for an on-off ramp of a highway. On-off ramps typically connect highways to local roads and lack the urban features shown in this image.
