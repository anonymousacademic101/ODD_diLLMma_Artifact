The road in the image has tram tracks embedded within it, indicated by the metal rails and the overhead power lines for the tram service, which are not typical features of an on-off ramp. It appears to be an urban street designed for mixed traffic, including both trams and road vehicles. On-off ramps are generally part of highway systems and do not include tram tracks. Additionally, the surrounding environment with buildings, signage, and other urban infrastructure is more consistent with a city street than a highway on-off ramp.
