NO.

The road in the image does not appear to be an on-off ramp; it looks like a regular urban street with multiple lanes, traffic lights, vehicles, and typical city infrastructure such as buildings and street signs. On-off ramps are typically associated with highways or expressways to facilitate the transition between the road and the highway. They usually have signage indicating the entrance or exit from a highway and do not have crosswalks or traffic lights as seen in this image.
