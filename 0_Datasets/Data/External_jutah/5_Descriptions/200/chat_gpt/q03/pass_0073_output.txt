NO.

The image shows a city street with multiple lanes of vehicles, bordered by sidewalks on which pedestrians are walking. There are buildings lining the road, along with typical urban infrastructure like street lights and signage. This environment does not resemble that of an on-off ramp, which typically connects highways to local roads and would not have pedestrian foot traffic or buildings directly adjacent to the roadway in the manner depicted. An on-off ramp would also have distinct signage and lane markings that are not present in the image provided.
