The road in the image is an intersection in an urban setting with traffic lights and crosswalks. On-off ramps typically connect highways to local roads and do not have traffic signals or crosswalks. They are designed to allow vehicles to enter and exit highways, which usually requires merging rather than the direct crossing of traffic streams at a right angle, as seen here.
