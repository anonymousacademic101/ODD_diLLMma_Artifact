This does not appear to be an on-off ramp. The photo depicts a city street with multiple lanes, storefronts, and typical urban street lighting. There's no indication of it being an access point to a highway or freeway, which is what on-off ramps typically connect to. Moreover, the presence of pedestrians and parked cars along the side of the street suggest it is a regular urban thoroughfare, not a ramp designed for entering or exiting higher-speed roadways.
