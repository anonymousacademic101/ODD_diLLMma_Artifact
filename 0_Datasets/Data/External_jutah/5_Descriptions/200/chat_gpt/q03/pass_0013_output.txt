NO.

The road depicted in the image appears to be a typical two-lane road, not an on-off ramp. There are multiple features that indicate this:

1. There are residential or commercial buildings alongside the road, which is typical of a local road rather than a highway on-off ramp.
2. The road has a solid yellow centerline, indicating a two-way street rather than the usual road markings found on highway ramps.
3. There are also vehicles parked on the side of the road, suggesting that it is likely a local street.
4. On-off ramps typically connect highways to local roads and do not have direct property access or parked vehicles along them.
