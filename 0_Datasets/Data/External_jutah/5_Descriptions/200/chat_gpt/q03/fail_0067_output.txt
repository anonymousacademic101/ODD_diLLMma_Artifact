NO.

The road visible in the image is not an on-off ramp; it appears to be an urban street next to historical buildings, characterized by brick architecture and pedestrian walkways. On-off ramps are typically associated with highways or expressways, where vehicles enter or exit these higher-speed roads. They would not be found in historical or downtown areas like the one depicted in the image.
