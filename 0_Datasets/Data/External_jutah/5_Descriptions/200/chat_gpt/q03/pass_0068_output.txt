NO.

The road in the image appears to be an urban street rather than an on-off ramp. On-off ramps are typically associated with highways and are designed to allow vehicles to enter and exit at high speeds. This street has multiple lanes, traffic signals, pedestrian crossings, and is surrounded by buildings and other urban infrastructure which suggests it is a regular city street.
