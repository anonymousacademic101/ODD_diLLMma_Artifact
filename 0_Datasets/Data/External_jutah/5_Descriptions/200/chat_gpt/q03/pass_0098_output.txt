NO.

The road in the image seems to be a main travel lane of a highway or expressway rather than an on-off ramp. This is indicated by the multiple lanes of traffic moving in parallel, the lack of signage indicating it's an exit or entrance ramp, and the heavy traffic flow consistent with a main travel lane. Ramps typically have signage indicating an exit number or destination, and the traffic patterns often show vehicles decelerating to exit or accelerating to enter the main road, which doesn't appear to be the case in this image.
