NO.

The photo shows a road with traffic cones indicating a section of the lane is cordoned off, likely due to construction or road work. There is no clear indication that this is an on-off ramp, as typically associated with highways or interstates. The surrounding environment appears to be more in line with an arterial road or street with commercial buildings, and the lack of highway signage or ramp-like infrastructure suggests this is not an on-off ramp.
