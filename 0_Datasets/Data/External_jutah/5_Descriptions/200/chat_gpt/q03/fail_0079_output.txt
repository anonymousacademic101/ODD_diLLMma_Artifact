NO.

The road in the image does not appear to be an on-off ramp. It looks more like a street in an urban area, with pedestrian crosswalks, storefronts, and a street-side caf√© visible. On-off ramps typically do not have these features and are designed to allow vehicles to enter or exit highways, not to provide access to local businesses or pedestrian areas. The road marking also indicates a bus stop or lane, which would not be found on an on-off ramp.
