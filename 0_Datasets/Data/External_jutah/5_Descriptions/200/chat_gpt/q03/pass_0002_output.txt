YES.

The road appears to be an on-off ramp based on several cues in the image. Firstly, the curvature of the road suggests it's designed to connect two different road levels, and the presence of a "Keep Right" sign indicates a directional change common to ramps. Additionally, the road infrastructure seen includes barriers and signage typical of on-off ramps, which are features that facilitate the smooth transition of vehicles to and from major roads.
