NO.

This road does not appear to be an on-off ramp. The scene depicted is of a multi-lane urban roadway with a solid median barrier to the left and a sidewalk with pedestrian fencing to the right. There are traffic signals controlling an intersection, which is not typical of highway on-off ramps that usually have merge or yield signs for entering or exiting freeway traffic without traffic signals. The presence of noticeable cross traffic and an intersection are indicators that this is a regular surface street rather than an on-off ramp.
