NO.

The road in the image appears to be a coastal highway rather than an on-off ramp. On-off ramps are typically connected to highways and interchanges and are designed to allow vehicles to enter or exit the main highway. The road in the picture seems to be a continuous route with no visible indications of an interchange or connection to a larger highway, and it runs parallel to the coastline, indicating it is more likely a scenic route or a coastal road rather than an on-off ramp.
