NO.

The scene depicted in the image shows a typical city street environment at what appears to be dusk or nighttime. The presence of traffic lights, pedestrian crosswalks, speed limit signs, buildings directly adjacent to the roadway, and the interaction of pedestrians and vehicles are all indicative of an urban street rather than an on-off ramp, which is typically associated with highways or freeways and generally lacks such features. The arrow sign suggests a sharp turn or a potential roundabout ahead, rather than an entrance or exit to a highway.
