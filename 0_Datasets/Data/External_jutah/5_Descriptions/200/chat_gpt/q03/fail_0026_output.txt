The road in the image does not appear to be an on-off ramp, but rather a regular city street with multiple lanes, traffic signals, pedestrian crosswalks, and surrounding buildings typical of an urban environment. On-off ramps are typically associated with highways or freeways and generally do not include features like pedestrian crosswalks and traffic lights at frequent intervals.
