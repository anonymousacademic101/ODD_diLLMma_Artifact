NO.

This does not appear to be an on-off ramp. The setting shows a traffic light-controlled intersection with multiple lanes and crosswalks, which is generally indicative of an urban street or avenue rather than an on-off ramp that connects highways or freeways with local roads. Additionally, the presence of public transit buses and pedestrian infrastructure suggests a more typical city street environment. On-off ramps typically do not have traffic lights, as their purpose is to facilitate the smooth transition of vehicles from local roads to highways or vice versa.
