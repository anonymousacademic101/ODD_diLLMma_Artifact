NO.

The image shows a road with multiple lanes and vehicles stopped, suggesting it is a regular street or avenue rather than an on-off ramp. On-off ramps typically have a singular lane and are designed to allow vehicles to enter or exit highways; the scene depicted does not appear to have the characteristics of an on-off ramp. Additionally, there are streetcar tracks visible in the lane, which are typically not found on highway on-off ramps.
