The road in the image is not an on-off ramp; it appears to be a regular street intersecting with an overhead structure, likely part of elevated transit tracks or a highway. The traffic lights, crosswalks, and street signs indicate normal street-level traffic controls rather than the typical yield or merge signs associated with highway on-off ramps.
