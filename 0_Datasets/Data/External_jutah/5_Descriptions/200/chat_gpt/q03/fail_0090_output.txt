NO.

The road in the image does not appear to be an on-off ramp typically associated with highways or freeways. Instead, it seems to be a regular city street with multiple lanes and green marking for what seems to be a bike lane on the right side. There are palm trees and a park-like setting on both sides of the street, which is typical for scenic drives or boulevards in urban areas. Additionally, the road has a relatively straight layout without the curvature typical of on-ramps or off-ramps.
