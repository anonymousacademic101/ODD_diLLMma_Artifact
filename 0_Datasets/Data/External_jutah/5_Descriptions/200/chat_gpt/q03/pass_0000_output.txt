NO.

The image shows a vehicle that appears to be stopped at a crosswalk, suggesting that this is more likely to be a regular surface road than an on-off ramp. The presence of traffic cones and construction signage may indicate road work or a temporary traffic pattern, but nothing specific to an on-off ramp scenario is evident here. The buildings in the background and the lack of highway infrastructure further support this observation.
