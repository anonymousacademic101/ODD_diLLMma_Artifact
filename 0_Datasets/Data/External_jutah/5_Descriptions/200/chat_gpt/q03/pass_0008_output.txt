The image shows a multi-lane road at a traffic signal intersection in an urban area, with buildings on either side. On-off ramps typically connect highways or freeways to local roads and do not have traffic signals or cross traffic at their access points. This setting suggests it is a regular city street rather than a highway on-off ramp.
