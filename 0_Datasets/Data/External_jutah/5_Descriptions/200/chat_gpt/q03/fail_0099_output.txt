NO.

The road in the image appears to be a regular urban street, not an on-off ramp. On-off ramps are typically connected to highways and are designed to allow vehicles to enter and exit at higher speeds. This road has multiple lanes, traffic signals, pedestrian crossings, and buildings close to the street, all of which are characteristic of urban roads rather than highway on-off ramps. Additionally, the speed limit sign showing "50" suggests a more typical urban speed limit rather than the higher speeds usually associated with highway ramps.
