NO.

The road in the image is a bridge, not an on-off ramp. It is depicted by its structural design, showing a truss bridge, which is typically built to span long distances such as river crossings. It does not have the characteristics of an on-off ramp, such as being a short stretch of road for entering or exiting a freeway.
