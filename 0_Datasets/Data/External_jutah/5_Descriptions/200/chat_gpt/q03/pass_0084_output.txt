NO.

This road is not an on-off ramp. The image shows a street in a residential or urban area with a crosswalk, indicated by a "STOP HERE FOR" sign with a pedestrian symbol. On-off ramps are typically associated with highways or freeways and facilitate the transition of vehicles onto or off of these high-speed roads. The features shown in the image such as a crosswalk, stop sign for pedestrians, regular vehicle lanes, and the presence of buildings and palm trees alongside do not correspond with typical characteristics of an on-off ramp.
