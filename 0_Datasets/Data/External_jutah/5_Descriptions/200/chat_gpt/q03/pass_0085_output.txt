This does not appear to be an on-off ramp based on the visual cues in the image. Instead, we are looking at an urban street intersection. The presence of traffic signals, marked pedestrian crossings, buildings directly adjoining the roadway, and the intersection with "43 Street" all indicate a regular city street rather than an on-off ramp, which typically connects highways to local roads and usually does not include traffic lights or direct access to businesses and residences.
