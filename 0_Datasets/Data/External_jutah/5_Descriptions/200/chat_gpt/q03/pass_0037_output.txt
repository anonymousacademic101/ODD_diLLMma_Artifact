NO.

The road in the image is not an on-off ramp but appears to be a regular urban street with multiple lanes, traffic signals, and crosswalks typically found within a city rather than a highway interchange. On-off ramps usually connect highways to other roads and rarely have pedestrian crosswalks or traffic signals as seen in this image.
