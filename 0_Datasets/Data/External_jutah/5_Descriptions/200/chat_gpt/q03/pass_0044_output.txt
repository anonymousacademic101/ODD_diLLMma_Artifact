NO

The road we are driving on does not appear to be an on-off ramp. It looks like a regular city street that is passing underneath an overpass, which may be part of a highway system above. The presence of parked cars along the curb, traffic signals ahead, and other city street features like a pedestrian walkway and fencing indicate that this is more likely a regular street rather than a highway ramp.
