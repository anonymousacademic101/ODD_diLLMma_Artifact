The road in the image does not appear to be an on-off ramp. The characteristics of the road suggest it is a regular urban street. There are businesses visible on the side, a traffic light ahead, and multiple lanes of traffic that indicate it is a part of a standard road network within a city or town rather than a ramp designed exclusively for the purpose of entering or exiting a highway or freeway.
