NO.

The road in the image is not an on-off ramp but appears to be a regular multi-lane urban road. On-off ramps typically connect highways/freeways with local roads and have a distinct curved design to manage the speed of entering or exiting traffic. This road is straight and has buildings alongside it, which is more characteristic of a city street than an on-off ramp. There are also no visible signs that indicate it is an on-off ramp, such as merge or exit signs, and the road does not seem to be leading to or from a highway.
