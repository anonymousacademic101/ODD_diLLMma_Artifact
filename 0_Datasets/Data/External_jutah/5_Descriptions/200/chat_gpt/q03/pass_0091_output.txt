Based on the image provided, this does not appear to be an on-off ramp. It looks like we are on a city street waiting in traffic, evidenced by the surrounding buildings, the dense traffic, and typical urban infrastructure. On-off ramps generally have less traffic, are connected directly to highways, and don't have the same urban setting with buildings so close to the road.
