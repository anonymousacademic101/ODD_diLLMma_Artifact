NO.

Based on the image provided, the road does not appear to be an on-off ramp. It looks more like an urban street intersection with traffic lights and a regular crosswalk, indicating it's likely part of a city grid rather than a highway interchange or ramp system. The presence of street names, traffic lights at multiple levels for different directions, and the urban setting with buildings alongside the road, all suggest this is not an on-off ramp, which typically wouldn't have such features and would be designed solely to facilitate the transition between highway and local roads.
