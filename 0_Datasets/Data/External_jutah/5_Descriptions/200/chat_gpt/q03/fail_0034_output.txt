This does not appear to be an on-off ramp because the road has a traffic light, crosswalks, and intersects with another city street, which are typical features of surface streets rather than on-off ramps of highways or freeways. On-off ramps typically facilitate direct access to and from highways and do not usually have traffic signals or crosswalks as seen in this image.
