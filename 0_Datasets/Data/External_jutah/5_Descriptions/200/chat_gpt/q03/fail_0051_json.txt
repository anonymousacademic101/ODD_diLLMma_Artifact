There are traffic signals present, which are typical for intersections but not common for on-off ramps, and there is a crosswalk with a pedestrian, suggesting urban street-level activity rather than a highway-related ramp. Moreover, the presence of directional arrows on the traffic lights indicates that it's an intersection where turns are regulated, whereas on-off ramps typically lead traffic on or off the highway without requiring such traffic signals for turning."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
