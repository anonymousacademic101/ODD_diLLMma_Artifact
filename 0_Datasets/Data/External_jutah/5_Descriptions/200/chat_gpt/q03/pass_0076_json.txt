On-off ramps typically have a singular lane and are designed to allow vehicles to enter or exit highways; the scene depicted does not appear to have the characteristics of an on-off ramp. Additionally, there are streetcar tracks visible in the lane, which are typically not found on highway on-off ramps.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
