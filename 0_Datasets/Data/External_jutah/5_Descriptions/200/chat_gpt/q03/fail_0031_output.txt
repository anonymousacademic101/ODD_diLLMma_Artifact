NO.

The scene does not depict a typical on-off ramp. The road is in an urban setting with multiple lanes, a traffic light ahead, and what appears to be a one-way sign to the left, suggesting it's part of a city street network rather than an on-off ramp, which usually connects highways to local roads without traffic lights and one-way restrictions at the point of entry/exit.
