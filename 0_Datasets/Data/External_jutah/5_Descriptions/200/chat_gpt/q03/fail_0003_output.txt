NO.

The image shows a road with traffic crossing an intersection, not a road with characteristics typical of an on-off ramp which generally includes merging lanes or exit lanes from a highway. This road appears to have multiple lanes with traffic lights and is likely a standard city street or arterial road. The overpass visible in the background and the exit sign for a highway (I-75) indicate the presence of a highway nearby, but the road we are looking at is not itself an on-off ramp.
