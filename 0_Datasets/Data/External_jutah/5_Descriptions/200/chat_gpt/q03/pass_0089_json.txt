Firstly, the presence of traffic lights implies that this is an intersection rather than a ramp, which typically would not have stoplights. Secondly, the road seems to be in an urban area with multiple lanes, buildings directly adjacent to the street, and signage for destinations such as the "Lincoln Tunnel," which are characteristic of city streets rather than highway ramps that usually facilitate traffic to and from highways without connecting directly to specific city streets or having such signage.
