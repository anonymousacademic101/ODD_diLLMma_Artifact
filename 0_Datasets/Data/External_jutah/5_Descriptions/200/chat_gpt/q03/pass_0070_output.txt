The road in the image does not appear to be an on-off ramp typically associated with highways or freeways. It looks more like a standard city street, evident by the presence of buildings close to the road, a stop sign ahead, pedestrian crosswalk lines, and the overall environment which suggests an urban area rather than a highway interchange. On-off ramps are usually designed to facilitate the acceleration and deceleration of vehicles entering or exiting highways and do not feature stop signs at their ends but rather merge into traffic flows.
