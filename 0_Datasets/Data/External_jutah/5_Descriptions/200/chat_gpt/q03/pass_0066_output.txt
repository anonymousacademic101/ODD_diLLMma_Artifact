The image shows a city street with multiple lanes and traffic signals, which suggests that it's an urban roadway rather than an on-off ramp, which typically connects highways to local roads and wouldn't have this kind of traffic infrastructure. The signs and buildings indicate it's an urban setting, and the painted "ONLY" on the road implies lanes designated for specific maneuvers like turning, common in city streets, not on-off ramps.
