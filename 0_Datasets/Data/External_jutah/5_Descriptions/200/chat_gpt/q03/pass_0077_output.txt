NO.

The road in the image appears to be a main road or urban street rather than an on-off ramp. On-off ramps typically connect highways to local roads and have a distinct design, usually curving or sloping to manage the transition between the different speeds of the highway and local traffic. In this image, the road is straight, with multiple lanes and buildings directly alongside it, which is common for urban streets but not for highway ramps. Additionally, there are storefronts and other signs of a commercial area that would not typically be found immediately adjacent to an on-off ramp.
