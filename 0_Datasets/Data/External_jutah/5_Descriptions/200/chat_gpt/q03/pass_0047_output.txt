The scene depicted in the image shows multiple lanes with traffic signals and signage typical of an urban roadway, not the merging or diverging patterns characteristic of an on-off ramp associated with highways or freeways. It appears to be a street under an overpass with direct access to city streets rather than a designated ramp for entering or exiting higher-speed traffic flows.
