The image appears to show an urban street with multiple lanes and typical city traffic including yellow cabs and a bus, which suggests it is not an on-off ramp that you would typically associate with highway or freeway access, but rather a regular street within a city. On-off ramps usually do not have facilities for buses or parking and are specifically designed for vehicles to enter or exit highways at higher speeds.
