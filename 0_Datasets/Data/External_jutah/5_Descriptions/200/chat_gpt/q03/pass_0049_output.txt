NO.

This does not appear to be an on-off ramp; it looks like an urban street intersection with traffic signals, pedestrian crossings, and buildings lining the sides, which are typical characteristics of city streets rather than highway ramps. Additionally, road ramps generally do not have traffic lights or crosswalks, as their main purpose is to facilitate vehicles entering or leaving highways. The sign "TO I-65 I-70" indicates that this location is directing drivers to the highways rather than being a part of them.
