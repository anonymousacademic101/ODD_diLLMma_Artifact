NO

The road shown in the image appears to be a city street at an intersection, not an on-off ramp. The presence of traffic signals, a crosswalk, and regular street signage all indicate that this is an urban road rather than an on-off ramp, which typically wouldn't have such features and would be designed to allow vehicles to enter or exit a freeway or highway. Additionally, the sign shows "NE 8 ST", which is more indicative of a regular street name rather than a highway ramp.
