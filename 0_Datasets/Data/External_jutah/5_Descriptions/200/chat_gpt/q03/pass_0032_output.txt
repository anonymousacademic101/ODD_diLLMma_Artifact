The road depicted in the image is not an on-off ramp; it is an urban street, likely in a downtown area, as evidenced by the high-rise buildings, street layout with crosswalks, traffic lights, and signs that are typical of a city street grid rather than the characteristics of highway ramps which are designed for vehicles to enter or exit freeways and typically do not include such urban infrastructure and environment.
