NO.

The road appears to be a regular city street or arterial road rather than an on-off ramp. This assessment can be made by observing multiple lanes for traffic in the same direction, traffic lights governing the flow of traffic, storefronts along the road, and no apparent indications of being an entrance or exit to a highway. On-off ramps typically have characteristics that distinguish them from regular city roads, such as merging lanes, lack of direct storefront access, and they often provide a transition between different types of roadways (e.g., from a highway to a local road or vice versa). The environment in the image suggests an urban setting with regular cross traffic controlled by traffic signals.
