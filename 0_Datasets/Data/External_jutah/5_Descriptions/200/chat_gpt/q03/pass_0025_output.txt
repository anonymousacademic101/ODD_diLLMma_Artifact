NO.

The road in the image does not have the characteristics of an on-off ramp. It appears to be a surface street with multiple lanes, traffic signals, and surrounding sidewalks with pedestrian walkways, which are typical features of city streets or avenues rather than a highway on-off ramp which typically has limited traffic controls and is designed to facilitate the acceleration or deceleration of vehicles joining or leaving a freeway or expressway.
