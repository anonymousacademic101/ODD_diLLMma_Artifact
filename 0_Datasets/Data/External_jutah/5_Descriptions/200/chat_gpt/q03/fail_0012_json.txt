On-off ramps are designed for vehicles to enter or exit highways and are characterized by their direct connections to high-speed roads. This image shows a road in a more residential or rural setting, indicated by the presence of trees, utility poles, and a speed limit sign for a sharp turn (as indicated by the yellow warning sign), which suggests a more local road with lower speed limits and different driving conditions than those found on highway ramps.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
