The road in the image is not an on-off ramp; it appears to be a regular city street at a traffic signal intersection. There are multiple lanes, traffic lights, and vehicles parked along the side of the road, which indicates that it is a typical urban road layout, not an on-off ramp, which typically connects highways and does not have crosswalks or traffic lights at this point.
