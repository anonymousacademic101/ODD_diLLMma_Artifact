NO.

The road in the image does not appear to be an on-off ramp; rather, it looks like a regular street or avenue that is approaching a junction where an on-off ramp to West 826 and North A1A is accessible, as indicated by the overhead road signs directing traffic to these routes. The lanes are clearly marked for going straight or turning to join these routes, which suggests that this is a preparatory section leading to an on-off ramp but is not the ramp itself.
