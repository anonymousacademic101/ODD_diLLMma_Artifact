The road in the image appears to be an urban street rather than an on-off ramp. Indications are the presence of a crosswalk, dense traffic lights, and commercial signage typical of city areas. On-off ramps usually have signage related to highways or interstates, fewer traffic lights if any, and they typically do not have commercial establishments directly adjacent to them.
