NO.

This image shows a multilane highway with vehicles traveling at highway speeds, which is indicative of a main travel roadway rather than an on-off ramp, which would typically be a single lane and would facilitate vehicles either accelerating to enter the highway or decelerating to exit it. The presence of multiple travel lanes and no evident deceleration or acceleration lane suggests that this is not an on-off ramp.
