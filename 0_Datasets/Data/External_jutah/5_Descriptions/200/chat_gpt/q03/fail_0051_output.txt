NO.

The road in the image appears to be a regular street intersection under a highway overpass rather than an on-off ramp. There are traffic signals present, which are typical for intersections but not common for on-off ramps, and there is a crosswalk with a pedestrian, suggesting urban street-level activity rather than a highway-related ramp. Moreover, the presence of directional arrows on the traffic lights indicates that it's an intersection where turns are regulated, whereas on-off ramps typically lead traffic on or off the highway without requiring such traffic signals for turning.
