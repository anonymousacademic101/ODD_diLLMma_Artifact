The road depicted in the image appears to be a standard multi-lane road rather than an on-off ramp. On-off ramps, which are used for entering and exiting highways or freeways, typically have a different design and are often characterized by a more pronounced curvature or a narrowing of lanes. The road in the picture has multiple lanes with regular traffic and is relatively straight, indicating it is likely a main road or arterial road rather than an on-off ramp.
