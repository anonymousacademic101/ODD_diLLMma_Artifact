NO

The road in the image does not appear to be an on-off ramp. It looks like a typical multi-lane road or highway with multiple lanes going in the same direction, consistent traffic flow, and no evident signage or road markings that would indicate an entry or exit from a highway. On-off ramps typically have distinct curvature or tapering, signage, and an obvious exit or merge from the main flow of traffic, which isn't present in this image.
