NO.

The road does not appear to be an on-off ramp. It looks like an urban street with multiple lanes, storefronts, street lights, overhead lines (possibly for trams or buses), and pedestrian traffic, which are not characteristic features of on-off ramps. On-off ramps typically connect highways to local roads and do not have the kind of infrastructure seen in this image, such as tram or streetcar tracks and closely situated buildings.
