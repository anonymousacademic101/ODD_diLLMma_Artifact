NO.

The image shows a road with traffic signals and lane markings that indicate normal street traffic rather than the typical characteristics of an on-off ramp. On-off ramps usually connect major highways to local roads and do not typically have crosswalks, traffic signals regulating intersection traffic, or parked cars like those seen in the distance of this image. Additionally, on-off ramps generally do not have perpendicular intersections as depicted here.
