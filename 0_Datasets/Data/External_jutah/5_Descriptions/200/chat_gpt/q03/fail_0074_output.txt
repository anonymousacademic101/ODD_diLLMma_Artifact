The road depicted in the image is not an on-off ramp; it is a city street. This can be determined by the surrounding environment that includes multi-story buildings on both sides of the street, various storefronts, traffic signals, and pedestrian walkways, which are typical characteristics of an urban street setting rather than an on-off ramp associated with highways or freeways.
