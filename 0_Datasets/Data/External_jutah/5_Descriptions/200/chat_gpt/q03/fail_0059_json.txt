There are also signs for a hospital (indicated by the "H" sign) and surface street directions (indicating "Venice"), which suggest this is an urban street intersection. On-off ramps for freeways typically do not have pedestrian crosswalks, traffic signals controlling straight through traffic like this, or direct access to local streets as seen in the image. The signs also indicate directions for the 10 Freeway with left and right arrows, suggesting that the on-off ramps are nearby but not the road we are on.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
