The presence of traffic signals, a crosswalk, and regular street signage all indicate that this is an urban road rather than an on-off ramp, which typically wouldn\'t have such features and would be designed to allow vehicles to enter or exit a freeway or highway. Additionally, the sign shows "NE 8 ST", which is more indicative of a regular street name rather than a highway ramp.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
