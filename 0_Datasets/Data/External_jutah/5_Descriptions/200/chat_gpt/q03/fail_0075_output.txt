NO

The road shown in the image does not appear to be an on-off ramp. Typically, on-off ramps are connected to highways or freeways and facilitate the transition of vehicles to and from these high-speed roads. The image shows a street in an urban environment with pedestrian crosswalks, traffic signals, and buildings in close proximity, which are all characteristics more consistent with regular urban roadways rather than on-off ramps.
