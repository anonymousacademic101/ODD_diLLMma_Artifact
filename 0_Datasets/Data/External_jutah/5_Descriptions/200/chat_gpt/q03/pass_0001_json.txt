On-off ramps typically connect highways/freeways with local roads and have a distinct curved design to manage the speed of entering or exiting traffic. This road is straight and has buildings alongside it, which is more characteristic of a city street than an on-off ramp. There are also no visible signs that indicate it is an on-off ramp, such as merge or exit signs, and the road does not seem to be leading to or from a highway.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
