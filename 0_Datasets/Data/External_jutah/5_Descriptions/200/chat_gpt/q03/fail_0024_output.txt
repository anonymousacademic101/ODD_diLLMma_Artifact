This does not appear to be an on-off ramp. The scene depicted in the image shows a typical city street with buildings, stores, and a traffic signal, which are not characteristic of highway on-off ramps. Additionally, there is a pedestrian crossing, parked cars, and a city environment that suggests regular street traffic, not the high-speed, merging conditions found at highway ramps.
