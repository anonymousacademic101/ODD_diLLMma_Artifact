The image shows a dilapidated area with overgrown vegetation and a "NO TRESPASSING DO NOT ENTER" sign on a rundown building, indicating that it is not in use and certainly not a functional roadway such as an on-off ramp. An on-off ramp would typically be part of a highway system, without such signs and in much better repair to support traffic.
