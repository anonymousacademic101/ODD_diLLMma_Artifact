The environment does not match typical characteristics of an on-off ramp. There are buildings directly adjacent to the road, parked cars along the side, pedestrian facilities, and no signage indicating proximity to a highway or a ramp. On-off ramps usually have limited access, leading to or from highways, with no direct building access or street parking.
