There are multiple lanes of traffic with vehicles stopped at a red traffic light, streetlights, signage for crosswalks, and a bus stop on the right side, which are all common in urban settings but not typical for highway on-off ramps. On-off ramps usually facilitate the flow of vehicles between city streets and highways, and they often lack the traffic control infrastructure required for dense urban traffic management, such as stoplights at frequent intervals.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
