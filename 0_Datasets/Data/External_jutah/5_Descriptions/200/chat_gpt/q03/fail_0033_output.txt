NO.

The road in the image does not appear to be an on-off ramp. On-off ramps are typically associated with highways or expressways and are designed to allow vehicles to enter or exit such roads. The scene in the image shows an urban setting with multiple traffic signals, a crosswalk, and a clearly marked pedestrian crossing which are common features of city streets rather than highway ramps. Additionally, there is a "LEFT LANE MUST TURN LEFT" sign which implies a regular intersection rather than an on-off ramp.
