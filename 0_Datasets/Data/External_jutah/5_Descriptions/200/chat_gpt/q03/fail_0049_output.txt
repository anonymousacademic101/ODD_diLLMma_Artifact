NO.

The way the cars are positioned and the presence of traffic lights, crosswalks, and sidewalks suggests that we are on a typical city street rather than an on-off ramp, which typically wouldn't have pedestrian crossing areas or traffic lights regulated intersection as seen here. The road appears to be near an entrance to a ferry terminal or transportation hub, given the signs for Battery Park, Ellis Island, and the Statue of Liberty Ferries, and the dense pedestrian traffic. On-off ramps generally serve to facilitate the transition between different levels of roadway, such as from surface streets to a freeway or highway, and do not usually accommodate pedestrian crossings directly.
