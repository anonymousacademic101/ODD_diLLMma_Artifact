It appears to be an urban street designed for mixed traffic, including both trams and road vehicles. On-off ramps are generally part of highway systems and do not include tram tracks. Additionally, the surrounding environment with buildings, signage, and other urban infrastructure is more consistent with a city street than a highway on-off ramp.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
