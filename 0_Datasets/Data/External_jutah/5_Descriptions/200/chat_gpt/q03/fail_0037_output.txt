This does not appear to be an on-off ramp. The setting looks like an urban street intersection at Monroe and Randolph based on the street signs. Additionally, the infrastructure such as traffic signals, storefronts, and pedestrian crosswalks indicate that this is a normal city street, not a highway or freeway on-off ramp.
