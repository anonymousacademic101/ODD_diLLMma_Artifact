NO

The road depicted in the image is not an on-off ramp. It is a street in an urban setting, complete with street lights, buildings, signs for businesses, pedestrians, and regular traffic patterns that are not characteristic of an on-off ramp. This looks to be a main road in a city, likely in a commercial or entertainment district, judging from the prominent signage and the architectural style of the buildings.
