Based on the presence of multiple traffic signals currently displaying green lights, we can infer that traffic flow in the direction facing the camera is permitted. There is a sign indicating "No Turn on Red" on the traffic light pole to the right, which instructs drivers not to make a right turn when the light is red. There is a directional sign for "Jefferson" indicating either the name of the cross street or the direction to Jefferson Avenue, which is a common street name in several cities. \n\nAdditionally, there\'s a lane designation sign on the right indicating that the lane is for right turns only. There are no visible pedestrians in the crosswalks, and vehicles are visible in the scene, but they\'re not in high density, which might indicate that traffic is flowing smoothly or that it\'s not a peak traffic time.\n\nTo the left, we see a large building with reflective glass windows and no distinctive signage that would indicate its purpose. In the center of the image, there is a building with a stone facade, and what appears to be a renovation or construction is taking place, as indicated by the scaffolding along the side. There is also a sign that points to "PEO" and "Public Parking."\n\nOverall, the driver facing this scene should pay attention to the traffic lights, the "No Turn on Red" sign if intending to turn right, the lane designations, and should be aware of any potential pedestrians that might enter the crosswalks as they approach the intersection.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
