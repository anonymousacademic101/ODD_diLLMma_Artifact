The image depicts a city scene at night with various elements relevant to road users. Here is what can be observed:

1. **Road Structure and Condition**: It appears to be a multi-lane urban road with a tram or light rail track running down the middle. The road surface looks dry, and there's no visible debris or obstructions on the road itself.

2. **Traffic Lights and Road Signs**: There is a set of traffic lights visible with the red light lit indicating that traffic should be stopped in the lane from which the photo is taken. Below the red traffic light, a no left turn signal is also visible. A pedestrian crossing light is visible further ahead, showing the red hand signal which means pedestrians should not cross. Various other traffic signals can be seen in the distance, presumably controlling different lanes or directions.

3. **Traffic**: Cars are stopped in the lanes, adhering to the red traffic light. We can see the rear lights of the vehicles indicating they are in a stationary position.

4. **Pedestrians**: Pedestrians are seen on the sidewalks. At least one pedestrian is crossing the street on the far side, and they appear to be doing so at a designated crosswalk, based on what can be inferred from their position relative to the street corner.

5. **Time of Day**: It is nighttime, as indicated by the dark sky and artificial lighting illuminating the scene.

6. **Advertisements and Billboards**: There are illuminated billboards and signs visible, suggestive of commercial activity in the area. A sign for the "Bond Place Hotel" is particularly prominent.

7. **Street Furniture**: There are bins, light poles, and a bicycle locked to a post on the sidewalk, typical of urban streets.

8. **Parking Information**: There is a sign for parking, indicated by a green "P" on a blue background and the word 'PARKING,' suggesting the presence of a parking lot or garage nearby.

9. **No-Standing Zone**: A street sign indicates a 'No Standing' zone, indicating that vehicles are not allowed to stop in this area.

10. **Public Transport Infrastructure**: There appears to be a station or stop for trams or a light rail system to the right of the image, with overhead shelters for waiting passengers.

11. **Buildings and Environment**: There are high-rise buildings, which likely contain commercial and residential spaces, indicating a densely populated urban environment.

Drivers in the scene should pay close attention to the traffic lights, maintain a safe following distance from the vehicle in front, and be alert for tram movements while also watching for any pedestrians who may be crossing the road despite the pedestrian signal indicating not to cross.
