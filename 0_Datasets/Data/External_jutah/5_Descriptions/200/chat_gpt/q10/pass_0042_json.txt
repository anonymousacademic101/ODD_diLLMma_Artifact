There are various buildings lining both sides of the street, with some appearing to have business or commercial functions. Also, greenery is visible in the form of trees along the sidewalk.\n\nThe road structure consists of a multi-lane road with at least two lanes visible for the direction we are facing. Yellow centerline markings separate traffic moving in opposite directions, and white lane markings delineate individual lanes. There's also a designated bike lane on the right side, with distinctive green paint and a bicycle symbol, which is currently occupied by a stopped bus.\n\nThe traffic scene includes a variety of vehicles, such as cars, SUVs, and a hybrid bus, which is prominently visible in the bike lane. There are no visible pedestrians crossing the road in the immediate foreground, but a person on a bicycle is seen further down the road, and there appear to be people walking on the sidewalks.\n\nAttention must be given to the road signs and traffic signals. On the right, there's a red traffic light for the bus lane. Given the presence of construction signs, cones, and barriers in the middle of the intersection, it's important to be attentive to potential alterations in traffic patterns and the presence of construction workers or machinery.\n\nDue to the construction, traffic might be slower than usual, and drivers should be cautious and alert. Furthermore, vehicles such as the white Jeep closest to the camera appear to be parked, which could indicate parking is allowed on this street, at least in some sections or at certain times. The bus and the construction signs imply there might be a temporary rerouting of regular traffic, and the bus stop is likely not in use."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
