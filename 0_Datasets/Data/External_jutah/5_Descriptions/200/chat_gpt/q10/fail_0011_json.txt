The road has two lanes for traffic moving in the same direction. The lanes are demarcated by white dashed lines, indicating that passing is allowed for vehicles. On the right side of the road, there is a shoulder followed by a barrier and then a steep drop-off leading down to the coast. On the left side, the roadside steeply ascends, forming a hill or mountain.\n\nThere is a white solid line along the right edge of the right lane, which marks the edge of the lane. Power poles align with the roadside on the left, featuring a series of wires stretching into the distance. In the distance, the road appears to curve to the right, following the coastline's contour. There is at least one vehicle visible in the distance, indicating that the road is not devoid of traffic, although it is not congested.\n\nNo pedestrians, bicyclists, or animals are visible in this image, and there are no visible road signs. No traffic lights or stop signs are present in the frame. The time of day appears to be midday or early afternoon given the bright light and lack of long shadows.\n\nWhile driving on this road, one should be attentive to the potential for oncoming traffic around curves, watch for any changes in traffic patterns, and be cautious of the road's proximity to the coast, as well as the lack of a substantial shoulder or barrier on the coastal side which could pose a safety risk if a vehicle leaves the roadway. The clear visibility and weather conditions, however, seem to be favorable for driving."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
