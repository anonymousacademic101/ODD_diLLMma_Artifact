Here are the factual details about the road environment and elements that would be relevant for driving:\n\n1. Road Structure: The road has multiple lanes with markings denoting turning lanes. There is a green bike lane on the right side of the road, indicating a space dedicated to bicyclists.\n\n2. Traffic Signals and Signs: A traffic signal is visible showing a green light, allowing traffic to proceed. Above the green light, there is a sign indicating that the left lane is for left turns only. An additional traffic light for the left turn lane shows a red arrow, signaling that cars in that lane must stop.\n\n3. Traffic and Vehicles: There are multiple vehicles on the road, including cars and a bus. Most vehicles are in their appropriate lanes, with a white car proceeding straight in a through lane, and a black car either parked or waiting in the right turn lane.\n\n4. Pedestrians: Pedestrians are visible on the sidewalks, some of whom are using umbrellas, which supports the inference of rainy weather. There also appear to be pedestrian signals at the intersection.\n\n5. Elevated Roadway: There is an elevated structure running parallel to the road with a train on it, suggesting the presence of an elevated train line or light rail system in this area.\n\n6. Buildings and Surroundings: The vicinity has tall buildings, some pedestrians, and urban infrastructure, which indicates a downtown or urban environment.\n\n7. Time of Day: Given the overcast sky and the level of light, it appears to be daytime, although the specific time of day cannot be determined without additional context.\n\n8. Additional Information: There\'s an advertisement billboard for a Jeep Wrangler on the side of a building, and we can see signs for parking as well as a sign that likely indicates a street name "Utah."\n\nDrivers in this scene should be attentive to wet road conditions, traffic signals, road markings, the presence of cyclists in the bike lane, and the movement of pedestrians around the intersection. Additionally, drivers should be aware of the train above, in case there are any corresponding traffic signals or signs relating to the train\'s presence.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
