The road structure includes multiple lanes, and the perspective suggests we are looking from one end of a divided boulevard, with concrete and green median dividers separating the two directions of traffic. The medians are adorned with planters filled with lush flowers and plants.\n\nTraffic appears to be moderate, with some vehicles visible on the road. There is a white SUV closest to the camera in the lane nearest to the median, followed by a series of other vehicles further back. On the opposite side, vehicles are also present, including a black sedan.\n\nThere are crosswalks painted on the street, indicating areas for pedestrians to cross. No pedestrians are visible in the crosswalks at the moment the photo was taken, but one can be seen strolling along the sidewalk on the right side of the image.\n\nThe traffic signs visible include a yellow pedestrian crossing sign ahead, indicating that drivers should be vigilant for pedestrians. There is also a no parking sign ("No Parking Anytime" with a tow-away zone symbol) attached to a lamp post on the right side.\n\nTo the right side of the image, there is a contemporary glass building with an entrance cover, which could be a commercial building or public transportation entry.\n\nGiven the shadows on the street, it appears to be midday, as the sun is casting short shadows behind the cars heading in the opposite direction of the camera\'s viewpoint.\n\nDrivers should be attentive to the proper lane for their intended direction, be aware of pedestrians potentially crossing, observe the no parking zones to avoid citations or towing, and follow all traffic signals and road signs.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
