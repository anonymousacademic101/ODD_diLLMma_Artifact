The scene includes the following details:\n\n1. Traffic Lights: The traffic lights are showing a green arrow to the left, indicating that vehicles in the corresponding lane are allowed to turn left. There is also an amber light on, suggesting that the lights are about to change, usually warning drivers to prepare to stop if they are unable to safely clear the intersection.\n\n2. Road Signs:\n   - There\'s a "Do Not Enter" sign on the right side of the image, warning drivers not to enter a restricted area.\n   - A small white rectangular sign underneath the "Do Not Enter" sign indicates the prohibition of left turns at certain times, but the specific times are not visible in this image.\n\n3. Traffic and Pedestrians: There are several cars visible, lining up at the intersection or stopped at the red light. A pedestrian is crossing the street, pushing a cart, and appears to be close to the sidewalk.\n\n4. Roadwork: There are orange traffic cones and barrels indicating either ongoing or recent roadwork or marking out a construction area on the road, which might be reducing the available lanes for traffic.\n\n5. Environment and Weather: The weather appears to be clear, and it seems to be daytime with shadows suggesting the sun is higher in the sky, likely midday. Vegetation is visible in the background, and the environment is typical of an urban setting with a mix of green spaces.\n\n6. Structures: The overpass has visible signs of aging or wear, such as staining and minor surface degradation, but no significant structural damage is apparent in the visible areas.\n\n7. Additional Details: On the right side, behind the pedestrian, there are electrical boxes and utility infrastructure beside the sidewalk.\n\nDrivers at this intersection should be prepared to stop if the lights change, should not make a left turn if during the prohibited times indicated by the sign, and should be mindful of pedestrians and any potential changes in traffic patterns due to road work or construction.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
