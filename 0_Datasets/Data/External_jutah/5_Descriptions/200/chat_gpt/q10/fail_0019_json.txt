The traffic light visible in the image is showing a red signal for the direction the observer is facing, indicating that vehicles in this lane must stop. On the right-hand side, there is a green road sign indicating that the cross street is Green Bay Road. The street name for the observerâ€™s direction is not visible.\n\nThe intersection also includes a railroad crossing, as indicated by the railroad crossing signs, signals, and the safety barriers that are currently in the raised position. This implies there is no immediate approach of a train, but motorists should be aware of the possibility of a train crossing.\n\nOn the right side, there is a pedestrian crossing with marked crosswalk lines and a pedestrian signal, which appears to be displaying a solid hand symbol, signaling pedestrians not to cross at this time. There is also a pedestrian waiting area with benches and a trash can, suggesting the proximity of a bus stop or public waiting area.\n\nNo pedestrians are visible in the image, and the traffic appears light, with no vehicles visible approaching the intersection. There are multiple traffic signal lights oriented for various directions of the intersection to control traffic flow.\n\nFrom this perspective, the road looks well-maintained and the markings are clear. There are multiple lanes for traffic, with indications of a left turn lane as seen by the arrow on the roadway closest to the observer.\n\nThe absence of shadows near the vehicles and traffic signs suggests the sun is at a high angle, which could imply the time of the photo is around midday. However, the exact time cannot be determined without shadows or a view of the position of the sun.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
