Road Structure: The road is a multi-lane city street. There is a bridge in the background indicating that the street crosses over some type of obstacle, such as a river or railway line. There are marked lanes on the road, and a crosswalk is visible in the foreground.\n\n2. Traffic Signals: Traffic lights are present, which are currently red for traffic moving straight ahead and for the left turn as well. The traffic light for the opposite direction is not visible in the picture, so its status is unknown.\n\n3. Road Signs: There are multiple road signs visible in the scene including "ONE WAY" signs indicating that the street traffic moves in one direction. There\'s a sign for "U" turn not allowed, and another indicating the start of a bridge with a clearance limit of 13\'-5".\n\n4. Traffic and Pedestrians: The street is relatively clear with only one visible white car, which seems to be stopped due to the red traffic light. There are no visible pedestrians in the crosswalk or on the sidewalks.\n\n5. Time of Day: It appears to be daylight with shadows suggesting it could be morning or afternoon. The sky is partly cloudy.\n\n6. Surrounding Buildings: There are office buildings of various heights surrounding the street. The architecture suggests a mix of modern and older buildings.\n\n7. Other Details: There is a blank white sign hanging above the roadway next to the traffic lights. The purpose of the sign is not clear as there is no visible text on it. There is also a "NO TURN ON RED" sign visible, meaning vehicles are not allowed to turn right when the traffic light is red.\n\nOverall, the scene looks like a typical downtown area in a city, and the street structure appears to be well-organized for the flow of vehicles.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
