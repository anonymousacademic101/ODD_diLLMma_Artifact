The traffic light is red for vehicles going straight, indicated by the red circle above the straight arrow. The turn lane to the left appears to have a green light, as signified by the green arrow pointing left, allowing vehicles in that lane to proceed with their turn.\n\nThere is a road sign with a blue background and a white arrow, indicating that the lane is designated for straight-through traffic. Additionally, there is a "No Right Turn" sign visible on the right edge of the image.\n\nVehicles are stopped at the intersection, awaiting the traffic signal to change. On the left side, there is a single motorcyclist who is also abiding by the traffic signals. Meanwhile, the pedestrian crossing lights appear to be showing red figures, signaling for pedestrians to not cross the road.\n\nStreetlights and illuminated signage contribute to the visibility on the road. The road markings include white dashed lines separating the lanes, as well as thick white pedestrian zebra crossings at the intersection.\n\nNo pedestrians are visible in the image, and there seems to be moderate traffic with a few vehicles visible in the intersection. Based on the visibility of the road signs and the clarity of the road markings, drivers should be able to navigate the intersection using the standard rules of the road, observing the traffic signals and complying with local traffic regulations.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
