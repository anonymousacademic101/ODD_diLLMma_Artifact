The image depicts an urban night-time scene with several elements related to road structure and traffic that can be identified:

1. **Time of Day**: It is night, as suggested by the dark sky and artificial lighting from street lights and building lights.

2. **Traffic Lights**: There is a traffic light that is green, indicating that vehicles in this direction are allowed to proceed.

3. **Road Signs**: There is a road sign indicating that a left turn is not allowed from 7 am to 7 pm, with the exception of TTC (Toronto Transit Commission) vehicles, suggesting this is likely a location in Toronto, Canada, or an area with a similar transit organization.

4. **Traffic and Vehicles**: The road has multiple lanes with vehicles visible. Some cars are stopped at the intersection, while others appear to be moving through it. There is a stopped vehicle in the foreground, which may be yielding for the pedestrian crossing the street.

5. **Pedestrian**: There is a person with a dog using the crosswalk, crossing the street from right to left in the image.

6. **Buildings and Environment**: The buildings show a mix of architecture, with the building on the right having a historical look, in contrast to the modern buildings in the background that are lit up. This indicates a city environment with mixed-use developments.

7. **Street Condition**: The road surface appears to be dry and in good condition. There is also a cone visible, suggesting there might be some road work or a temporary condition affecting the lane near where the pedestrians are crossing.

8. **Public Transportation**: There are overhead wires visible in the image, which are typical for trolleybus or tram public transportation systems.

Drivers in this scene should pay attention to the green traffic light allowing them to proceed, be cautious around the pedestrian crossing the street, and observe the road sign restrictions for left turns during specific times. They should also be aware of possible construction or road work indicated by the cone and pay attention to any other traffic signals and signs not visible in the image.
