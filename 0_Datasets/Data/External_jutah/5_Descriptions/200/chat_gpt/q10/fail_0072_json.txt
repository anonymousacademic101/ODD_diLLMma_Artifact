The road structure consists of multiple lanes, with a visible intersection ahead. There are several traffic signs indicating important rules for this area:\n\n1. There\'s a "Do Not Enter" sign on the right side of the road, which means vehicles are prohibited from entering the road in that direction.\n2. Below the "Do Not Enter" sign, there\'s a "One Way" sign indicating that traffic flows in a single direction, away from the perspective of the camera.\n3. There is a traffic signal displaying a green light for going straight, indicating it\'s permissible for traffic facing the signal to proceed through the intersection.\n4. There\'s also a sign on the traffic light pole that reads "No Turn on Red," which means that turning right on a red signal is not allowed.\n\nNo pedestrians are visible in the immediate vicinity of the intersection, and there does not seem to be heavy traffic at this moment. There are a couple of vehicles: a red bus on the right side that is not in motion and a gray car that is making a turn in front of the bus.\n\nAdditionally, there are tall buildings in the background, suggesting a downtown area of a city. Some signage and branding, such as that of Marriott and PwC, can be seen on the buildings, but without indicating either location or other context.\n\nFor a driver in this situation, it\'s important to pay attention to the traffic signals, the "Do Not Enter" and "No Turn on Red" signs, and be aware of the direction of traffic flow to safely proceed.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
