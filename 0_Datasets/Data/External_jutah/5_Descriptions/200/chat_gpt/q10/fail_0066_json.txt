The street sign indicates that this location is at the intersection of 38th St. and Market St. Near the signpost, there is a street sign pointing towards Interstate 76, suggesting that this location is close to an entrance to the I-76 highway.\n\nThe road has multiple lanes and is marked with white dashed lines indicating traffic lanes. Additionally, there\'s a crosswalk in the immediate foreground, with corresponding pedestrian signals attached to the traffic light pole on the corner. The pedestrian signal is displaying the "Don\'t Walk" symbol, which is a static hand indicating that pedestrians should not cross at this moment. Vehicles should be alert for pedestrians who may be following or disregarding this signal.\n\nThere is a red car in the foreground that appears to be stopped before the crosswalk. This could indicate that the traffic light facing the car is red or that the car is yielding to pedestrians, although no pedestrians are visible in the crosswalk. The traffic is moderate with other cars seen driving along the street in both directions.\n\nThere are trolley lines above the street, indicating that there is a trolley or tram system present in this area. Drivers should be aware of trolley movements and any accompanying traffic rules.\n\nTo the right of the image, there is a street camera on top of the traffic light pole, which might be used for monitoring traffic conditions or for security purposes.\n\nThe buildings lining the street are multi-story and appear to be commercial or residential structures. There\'s minimal foliage, restricted to a small fenced-off plot on the right side, which is next to one of the buildings and across from the stopped red car.\n\nLastly, in the bottom right corner of the image, there is a watermark that reads "JUTAH," possibly attributed to the individual or entity that holds the copyrights or is otherwise associated with the image.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
