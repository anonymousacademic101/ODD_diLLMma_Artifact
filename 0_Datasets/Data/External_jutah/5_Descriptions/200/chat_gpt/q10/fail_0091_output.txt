2. Traffic Signals: There are traffic signals with green arrows for vehicles intending to proceed straight or make a left turn, indicating it's their right of way. A sign next to the traffic signals states "NO TURN ON RED," instructing vehicles not to turn on the red light.

3. Pedestrians: Two individuals appear to be crossing the street within the pedestrian crosswalk.

4. Surroundings: High-rise buildings and palm trees are visible, suggesting a downtown area likely in a warm climate. The closest building has a sign indicating "Southeast Financial Center," and a vehicle partially visible on the left looks like a silver sedan waiting for the light.

5. Elevated Infrastructure: There is an elevated railway or walkway structure behind the traffic light, with a train or tram visible on the tracks, suggesting the presence of public transportation infrastructure.

6. Commercial Vehicle: On the right, there is an orange crane or lift parked on the sidewalk, possibly related to construction or maintenance work, with the boom extended vertically.
