This image depicts a city street scene at night. Here are several factual observations about the image:

1. Road Structure: The image shows a multi-lane road with a dedicated lane for trams or light rail vehicles, as indicated by the rail tracks in the pavement. The road is wet, suggesting recent rain or cleaning.

2. Road Signs: There are traffic signals visible in the distance, with at least one signal showing green, indicating that traffic is flowing in the direction we're looking at. There is a road sign near the center of the image indicating a tram or train stop ahead.

3. Traffic: There are several vehicles on the road. In the foreground, a white sedan is stopped in the lane closest to the camera, and there is at least one other vehicle stopped ahead of it. Further in the distance, several red tail lights indicate the presence of more vehicles. A bus with bright blue lights on its top is also visible further down the road, likely indicating it's a special service vehicle like an emergency or police bus.

4. Pedestrians: There are a few pedestrians on the sidewalks. On the left, two individuals are walking on the sidewalk, one of whom is closer to the edge of the road. On the right, a small group of people can be observed standing by the fence, potentially waiting to cross the street or congregating for another reason.

5. Time of Day: It is nighttime, as is evidenced by the dark sky and artificial lighting on the street, from street lamps, traffic signals, and the lights of the vehicles.

6. Other Observables: The buildings lining the street have lights on, indicating that some rooms are occupied. Overhead, wiring for the tram or light rail's power system crisscrosses above the street. There may also be a construction site to the left, as suggested by the fencing and the potential presence of construction signage.

Given these observations, drivers on this road should pay careful attention to the tram tracks when changing lanes, adhere to traffic signals, and be aware of the potential stopping of trams at designated stops which could affect traffic flow. Pedestrians near the road's edge and any changes to usual road patterns due to construction work are additional considerations drivers would need to be aware of.
