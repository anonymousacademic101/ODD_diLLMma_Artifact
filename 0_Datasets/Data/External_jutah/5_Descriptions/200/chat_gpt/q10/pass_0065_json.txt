The specific features of the road include:\n- A green traffic signal, indicating that vehicles in this part of the road are permitted to proceed straight ahead.\n- A "NO TURNS" sign is installed next to the traffic light, which means no turning movements are allowed at this intersection for lanes facing this signal.\n- White pedestrian crosswalk lines are visible on the pavement.\n- There are also visible lane markings indicating a turning lane as well as through lanes.\n- The street sign reads "Pollock St," providing the name of the intersecting street.\n\nThe image shows light traffic with vehicles visible in the distance on both sides of the road. There are no visible pedestrians crossing the road or on the sidewalks in this frame. There are trees lining the street, and residential houses can be seen on the right side of the road. No emergency vehicles, construction signs, or other unusual occurrences are apparent in the image that a driver might need to pay attention to besides the standard road signs and signals.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
