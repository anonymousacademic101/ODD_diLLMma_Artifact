It appears to be a two-way street with a single lane marked for traffic in each direction. The road has white traffic line markings, including pedestrian crosswalk lines. A green bike lane is visible on the right side of the street, closest to the sidewalk.\n\nOn the right side of the street, there is a row of buildings with commercial establishments at the ground level. There is a food establishment with large lettering ("PRET") on its storefront. Several pedestrians are visible in the image: a few individuals walking on the sidewalk and a pair walking across the crosswalk. They seem to be adhering to pedestrian rules, crossing at the designated area.\n\nOn the sidewalk, there is street vending with a table set up and items displayed on top for sale, as well as a cart with items organized on it. There\'s a green waste receptacle on the sidewalk as well.\n\nThere is a delivery truck parked on the far side of the street, which has graffiti on the rear door. A man is standing near the truck on the sidewalk, possibly a worker or pedestrian. He seems to be looking towards the traffic or the street vendors.\n\nStreet banners and signs are visible on the poles, including one that reads "Button up!" which could be an advertisement or a public service announcement.\n\nAs there are no traffic lights visible in this direct view, it is unclear what the traffic signals might be dictating at this moment. There are no immediate signs of traffic congestion, and no cars are visible in the immediate area, except for the parked delivery truck.\n\nIt is important to note that while driving through this area, attention should be paid to following traffic signs that may not be visible in the picture, being vigilant for pedestrians, particularly in crosswalks, and respecting the bike lane by checking for cyclists before turning or crossing it.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
