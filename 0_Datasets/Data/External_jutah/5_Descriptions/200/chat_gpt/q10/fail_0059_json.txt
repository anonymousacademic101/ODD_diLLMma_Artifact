The traffic lights for the direction we are facing are green, indicating it is permissible for vehicles to proceed straight or make turns if safe to do so. There is a directional sign ahead denoting Venice to the left and also indicating that access to the 10 Freeway is to the right, with the left lane designated for eastbound access, and the right lane for westbound access to the freeway.\n\nOn the street corner to the right, we can see a pedestrian waiting presumably to cross, alongside a cyclist who is standing with their bicycle. On the left sidewalk, there\'s a pedestrian crossing the street, carrying what appears to be a red bag. Adjacent to the intersection, we see a building painted in a tan color with a white retaining wall; there\'s also street art visible on the side of a building facing the intersection.\n\nUtility poles and overhead power lines are visible, which is common in urban settings. There is also signage indicating the street names "Utah" for the crossing street and visible street names for the main road, although partially obscured, it appears to be "Venice."\n\nThere\'s light vehicular traffic visible, with a few cars on the road and at the intersection. In the distance, buildings against the skyline and trees can be seen, typical of dense urban landscapes. Shadow patterns on the road and buildings suggest it is either the morning or late afternoon hours, given the low angle of the sunlight.\n\nDrivers at this intersection would need to pay attention to the traffic signals, pedestrians crossing the streets, cyclists, and any lane-specific signs to ensure proper navigation toward their intended direction, as well as any other posted traffic regulations.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
