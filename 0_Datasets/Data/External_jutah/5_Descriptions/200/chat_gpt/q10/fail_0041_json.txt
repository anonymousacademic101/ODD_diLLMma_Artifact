It features a multi-lane road with pedestrian crossing areas demarcated by white paint. There are traffic signals suspended above the road, which are currently displaying red lights, instructing vehicles on this side of the intersection to stop.\n\nOn the right, there is a no-left-turn sign attached to a traffic signal pole, indicating that vehicles at the intersection are not allowed to make a left turn. Just behind the aforementioned sign, a pedestrian signal is visible, which appears to be displaying a red hand, signaling pedestrians not to cross.\n\nThe road beyond the intersection continues forward and appears to have traffic lights at regular intervals. While the traffic on the closest lanes to the camera is not visible, there are a few vehicles visible in the distance, traveling in the opposite direction, indicating that traffic is present but not congested.\n\nSidewalks border both sides of the road with curb cuts for accessibility at the intersection. Buildings flank the street with various signs and advertisements visible. One prominent sign on the building directly ahead advertises a space for sale, accompanied by a phone number.\n\nThe sky is overcast, suggesting a cloudy day, and there are no pedestrians in immediate view, making it hard to determine the current weather conditions beyond the wet road.\n\nThe condition of the buildings, some signages like "FOR SALE," and the absence of pedestrians or bustling activity could suggest an area that is not very commercially active, undergoing economic challenges, or perhaps it\'s a time of day when foot traffic is minimal.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
