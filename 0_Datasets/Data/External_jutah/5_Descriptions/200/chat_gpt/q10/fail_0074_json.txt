The road is a multi-lane, one-way street with vehicles parked on the right-hand side and a silver sports car directly ahead of the viewer\'s perspective. There appears to be a bike lane on the right, marked by red pavement, and signage indicating that vehicles must yield to bicycles.\n\nLooking at the road structure, there are multiple traffic signals visible, all showing red lights, indicating that traffic is currently stopped. The intersection ahead appears to be governed by traffic lights for different lanes, pedestrian crossing signals, as well as a "No Turn on Red" sign visible on the right. Lane markings on the road include dashed white lines separating lanes of traffic and solid white lines indicating the boundary of the parking lane.\n\nThere is construction activity on the right side of the street, with scaffolding covering the facade of a building and a temporary fence labeled "SIDEWALK CLOSED," directing pedestrians away from the construction zone. While there are no pedestrians readily visible in the image, it is important for drivers to remain vigilant for people who might walk into the roadway, especially given the sidewalk closure.\n\nOn the left, storefronts and office buildings line the street, and no pedestrians or traffic hazards are immediately seen there. The presence of traffic and parked cars suggests a typical urban environment with potential for congestion and the need for careful attention to changing traffic conditions. The vehicles shown include a mix of sedans, SUVs, and a sports car. There are also tree-lined sidewalks and various commercial signs, indicating an active commercial area. The absence of shadows directly under the cars suggests the sun is high in the sky, indicating a time around midday.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
