The image shows a street scene that appears to be taken at dusk or early evening. Here are the factual details as seen in the photo:

- Location: The road signs indicate this is the intersection of Las Vegas Blvd and Ogden. This implies that the photograph is likely taken in Las Vegas, Nevada.
- Road structure: The road appears to be a multiple-lane street with at least two lanes of traffic in each direction. There's a visible median separating the opposite flows of traffic.
- Road signs: Apart from the street name signs, there is a no U-turn sign on the traffic light pole in the median. The traffic lights are showing green for the vehicles moving in the direction the photo is taken, suggesting it's their right-of-way.
- Traffic: There is a moderate amount of vehicular traffic with vehicles stopped at or moving through the intersection. The cars' headlights and brake lights are visible, which is common for lower light conditions.
- Pedestrians: A pedestrian is visible crossing the street within a marked crosswalk, and they have a walk signal as indicated by the illuminated pedestrian crossing sign.
- Time of day: It appears to be twilight or early evening as the streetlights are on, the sky is darkening, but there's still some ambient light.
- Attention points for driving: Drivers should pay attention to the traffic signals, the pedestrian crossing the street, the road signs, and the other vehicles around them. The green traffic lights indicate that it is legal to proceed through the intersection, but caution is advised due to the pedestrian in the crosswalk and the general activities around the bustling street.

There is a distinctive neon sign for a hotel with the name "OASIS" visible on the left side of the road which is typical of the neon signage found in Las Vegas.
