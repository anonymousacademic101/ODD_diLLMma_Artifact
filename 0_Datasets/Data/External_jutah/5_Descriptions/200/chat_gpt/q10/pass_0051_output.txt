The image depicts an urban street scene during what appears to be twilight or early evening, as the sky is a dark blue color, indicating that the sun has likely set or is close to setting. The street is illuminated by streetlights and other urban lighting. 

The road is a multi-lane, two-way street with vehicles parked along the right side facing the viewer. On the left side, we can see a dedicated bike lane with green markings; this is indicated by the bicycle symbol and an arrow suggesting the direction of travel. The visible traffic lights are green, indicating that the vehicles in the lanes are permitted to proceed. The cars on the road are following traffic signals and are in motion. 

There are no visible pedestrians in the image, which suggests low pedestrian activity at the time the photo was taken. Various commercial or corporate buildings, some with reflective glass facades, line the street, interspersed with trees along the sidewalks. 

Electricity and communication wires are visible overhead. Additionally, there is a utility pole on the left side.

For someone driving in this situation, it's important to pay attention to the traffic lights, observe the parked cars (being cautious of any that might pull out into traffic), and keep an eye on the bike lane to ensure the safety of cyclists. Since it appears to be evening, the driver would also need to use headlights and be more vigilant for pedestrians and cyclists who may be less visible after dusk.
