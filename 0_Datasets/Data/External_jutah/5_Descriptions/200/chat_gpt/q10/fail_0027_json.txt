Here are the key factual elements visible in the image:\n\n- There are at least two buses in the image, one of which is a blue electric bus as indicated by the text on its side.\n- Traffic lights are visible; the lights for ongoing traffic are green, suggesting that the traffic in this direction has the right of way.\n- There are road construction warning cones placed along the road, indicating either ongoing or recent road work. The cones are arranged in a manner that appears to guide vehicles away from the sidewalk or a specific part of the road.\n- There is a pedestrian crossing visible, but no pedestrians are currently crossing.\n- Some tents and temporary structures can be seen in the background on the left side of the street, suggesting there may be an event or construction in the park area.\n- Additional traffic signals and signage are installed but not clearly legible in the image.\n- No other vehicles or pedestrians are immediately apparent in the scene.\n- The weather seems to be clear with no sign of precipitation.\n\nDrivers in this scene should pay attention to the traffic lights, road cones indicating construction or road work, and watch for any pedestrians that might enter the crosswalk. Additionally, they should monitor for any road signs that provide further instructions or information about the road conditions.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
