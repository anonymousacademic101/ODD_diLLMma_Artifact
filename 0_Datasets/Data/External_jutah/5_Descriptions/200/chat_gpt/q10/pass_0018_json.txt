The road is organized with one lane for vehicles, and the traffic light is green, indicating that vehicles in this lane may proceed. The street is divided with a landscaped median, which contains smaller palm trees and vibrant flowers, separating opposing traffic directions.\n\nSeveral road signs are visible. One yellow sign informs of an "Annual Block Party," slated for "June 18-18 (?)," indicating there may be an upcoming event when this photo was taken. There\'s also a white sign with a \'left turn\' symbol, above which yellow warning signs indicate that there is "No left turn" during the specified times of "3 PM-7 PM Mon-Fri." This restriction aids in regulating traffic flow during peak hours.\n\nOn the lower right, there\'s a corner of a small white sign, which is not fully visible, but such signs typically indicate parking regulations or specific street-related information.\n\nThere is light vehicular traffic, including a white van in the foreground bearing a license plate that reveals it\'s registered in California. This plate starts with "6LOJ" and is followed by three unreadable symbols due to the angle and distance. There is also a white sedan parked on the right-hand side of the street with a visible personalized license plate that reads "TESLA," suggesting that the car is a Tesla.\n\nPedestrian activity is present; people are visible on the sidewalk to the right. One person seems to be entering or leaving a storefront, and a small group is gathered by the entrance of the building, which features signage for "BVLGARI," indicating a luxury storefront.\n\nWhile driving in this scene, one would need to pay attention to the traffic light, the road signs indicating turning restrictions, parked cars, and any pedestrians that might cross the street or be in close proximity to traffic. The time of day seems to be daytime, and the shadows suggest it might be midday or early afternoon.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
