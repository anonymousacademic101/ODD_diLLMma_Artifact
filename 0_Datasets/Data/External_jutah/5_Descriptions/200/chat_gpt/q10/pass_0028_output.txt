- Pedestrians: A couple of pedestrians are visible on the sidewalk to the right. They appear to be following pedestrian traffic norms, walking on the sidewalk instead of the street.

- Time of Day: The lighting in the image suggests that it might be taken either in the early morning or early evening, as the sky is light but not bright, indicating the sun is not at its peak.
