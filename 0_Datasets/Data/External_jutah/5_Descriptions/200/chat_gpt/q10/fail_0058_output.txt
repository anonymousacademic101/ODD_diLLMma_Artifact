While driving, one would need to prepare to stop as the traffic light is about to turn red, watch for pedestrians potentially crossing the street, and pay attention to any signals or signs indicating the rules of this particular intersection. It is also crucial to observe the parked cars for any movement, as a door may open or a car may pull out into traffic.
