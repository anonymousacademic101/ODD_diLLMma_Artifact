This image depicts an urban street scene on a wet day, indicating that there has been recent rainfall. The road surface is wet, and the sky appears overcast. There are several details to note:

1. Traffic Signals: The traffic light in the immediate view is red, indicating that traffic in this direction should be stopped. 

2. Road Markings and Signs: The road markings are not fully visible, but there are signs for parking restrictions ("2 Hour Parking 7 AM - 5 PM Except Sunday" and "No Parking Tow Away Zone") visible to the left-hand side.

3. Pedestrians: There are at least two pedestrians. One is located on the sidewalk to the left, under a bus shelter, and another pedestrian is crossing the street toward the right of the image, implying that there might be a pedestrian crossing signal allowing them to cross.

4. Road Structure: The intersection seems to be a typical four-way setup, with traffic lanes not fully visible from this perspective, but there's an implication of at least two lanes because there's a vehicle in the center of the image apparently waiting at the red light, and another turning right, suggesting that there may be a dedicated turning lane.

5. Vehicles: There are a few vehicles in sight. One white car is stopped at the traffic light, and another car is in the midst of a right turn. Other vehicles are parked in the background, and there appears to be no current traffic congestion.

6. Time of Day: It is difficult to determine the exact time of day due to the overcast conditions, but the street lamps being on imply either early morning or evening, or simply that the ambient light is low enough to require artificial lighting.

7. Safety Cones: There are safety cones placed in the foreground, likely indicating either ongoing or recent roadwork, a temporary hazard, or some area of caution that drivers and pedestrians need to be aware of.

8. Buildings and Environment: The buildings surrounding the intersection are multi-story, and the architecture suggests a mixture of commercial or possibly mixed-use structures. The presence of a fenced parking lot and the bus stop suggest an urban setting with amenities for transit.

9. Other: The street sign on the right-hand side is labeled "UTAH," possibly indicating the name of the street or place, which could be useful for navigation.

Drivers and pedestrians in this scene should exercise caution due to the wet road conditions which can reduce tire traction and increase braking distances, and be aware of any potential changes in traffic patterns due to the safety cones and any possible roadwork.
