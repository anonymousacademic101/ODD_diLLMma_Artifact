The image presents a view of an urban street scene with various elements that are pertinent to driving conditions and road safety. Here is a detailed factual description:

- **Road Structure**: The road is a multi-lane urban street with what appears to be lanes designated for different directions and possibly turning lanes, as indicated by the road markings. There is a pedestrian crosswalk in the foreground with prominent zebra stripes.
  
- **Traffic Signals and Road Signs**: Overhead, there are traffic lights, and the one facing the viewpoint is red, signaling vehicles in this direction to stop. Additionally, there are circular road signs indicating speed limits of 60 km/h and 50 km/h, suggesting that there may be variable speed limits or an upcoming change in the speed limit.
  
- **Vehicles and Traffic**: There are several vehicles on the road, including cars and motorbikes. The traffic seems moderate and vehicles are in their respective lanes, waiting for the lights to change, as evidenced by the red traffic signal.
  
- **Pedestrians**: There is at least one pedestrian visible, standing on the corner of the sidewalk, waiting, probably for the pedestrian signal to cross the street. No one is seen crossing the road in the crosswalk.

- **Time of Day**: It appears to be daytime, with clear skies indicating good visibility. Shadows are short, which could suggest that the photo was taken close to midday.

- **Surrounding Area**: There are tall buildings on either side of the street, indicating a commercial or possibly a downtown area. Shop signs and other commercial establishments are visible.

- **Miscellaneous**: There is a green scooter or motorbike partway onto the pedestrian crossing zone, which might be an obstruction to pedestrians or indicate irregular parking. Also, the air looks somewhat hazy, which could be a result of pollution, mist, or simply the light conditions. 

For a driver in this setting, it's important to pay attention to the traffic lights, adhere to the posted speed limits, be aware of pedestrians, especially near crosswalks, ensure proper lane usage, and be mindful of any potentially irregularly parked vehicles like the green scooter.
