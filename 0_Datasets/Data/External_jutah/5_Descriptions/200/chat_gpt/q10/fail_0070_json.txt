The road structure consists of a multi-lane setup with visibly marked lanes on the pavement; there is no immediate sign of traffic. Approximately three parked cars can be seen reflected in the building\'s windows on the right side.\n\nLooking at the road signs, a blue directional sign indicates that Interstate 376 (I-376) East is accessible via a turn, although the turn direction is not visible in the image. Another sign below the I-376 sign emphasizes that turning right is not allowed at a red light. The street name sign states that the location is the intersection of Cherry Way and Boulevard of the Allies.\n\nThe traffic light is green with an additional left-turn arrow lit, indicating that vehicles in the appropriate lane are allowed to turn left at this moment. The paint on the road does show a left turning arrow, suggesting the possibility of a designated left turn lane.\n\nThere are no visible pedestrians in the frame. The buildings have a historical and professional aesthetic, with visible signage indicating a law firm named Colarusso & Cohen, P.C., as well as a sign reading "PROFESSIONAL OFFICE BUILDING" on the left building.\n\nLastly, there is some minor visible wear and tear on the road surface, suggesting regular usage, and patches of water that might be the result of cleaning, precipitation, or linked to maintenance activities.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
