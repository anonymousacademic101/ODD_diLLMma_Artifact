The sky is overcast, suggesting either early morning or late afternoon, or possibly overcast weather conditions.\n\nWe can see several vehicles stopped at the traffic light. Ahead, the traffic lights for both straight-going and left-turning lanes are red, indicating that traffic must come to a halt in those lanes. There is a pedestrian crossing light visible as well, with a red hand signal indicating that pedestrians should not cross.\n\nOn the road, the lane markings indicate multiple lanes for vehicles with one turning lane, as indicated by the arrow on the road. The vehicles consist of sedans and SUVs, and they appear properly positioned within their lanes.\n\nTo the left of the image, there is a large building with a sign that reads "Jill and Frank Fertitta Hall," indicating the building could be part of an educational institution or related to a university campus, given the architecture and nature of the signage.\n\nOn the right side of the image, we see a building labeled "USC Hotel," suggesting the location is nearby or part of the University of Southern California campus.\n\nNo pedestrians are visible in the image, and no immediate road hazards are present. Based on license plates, the location is likely in the United States, with plates from both California and Utah visible.\n\nDrivers at this intersection should be paying attention to the red traffic light, road signs, and any changes in the signal. It\'s important to remain stationary until the light turns green or until directed by any additional road signs or traffic signals. Safety is paramount; therefore, maintaining attention to the traffic signals and road conditions is crucial for avoiding accidents.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
