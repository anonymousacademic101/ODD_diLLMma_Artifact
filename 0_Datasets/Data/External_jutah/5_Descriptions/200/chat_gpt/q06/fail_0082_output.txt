In the image provided, we can observe construction barriers set up around a site on the sidewalk to the right of the road. There's visible scaffolding and construction hoarding, indicating ongoing construction work in the vicinity of the road. However, the roadway itself does not appear to be directly obstructed by construction activities, but the adjacent work may impact road conditions or traffic flow.
