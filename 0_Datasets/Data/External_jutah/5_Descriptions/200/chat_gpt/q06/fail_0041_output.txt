YES

The image shows several indicators suggesting that there may be construction on the road we are driving on:

1. Patchy pavement: The road surface appears uneven and patchy, which could hint at recent or ongoing road work.
2. Barricades: There are orange and white traffic barricades on the median, which are commonly used to guide traffic away from construction zones.
3. Lane markings: The lane markings look worn and are not clearly visible in places, which might be due to construction activity that has disrupted the normal lane lines.

These signs are typical of road construction or road work areas, which leads to the conclusion that there is construction on this road.
