There is visible construction in the image, as indicated by the presence of scaffolding on the right side and signs that say "SIDEWALK CLOSED." The construction appears to be on the building adjacent to the road, rather than on the road itself, but the impact on the sidewalk can affect road conditions and traffic, such as pedestrian flow or potential lane closures.
