NO.

The image shows a vehicle on a road with no apparent signs of construction on the road itself. The road markings are visible and there don't seem to be any construction barriers, equipment, or workers on the road. There is some construction equipment visible behind the bus stop on the side of the road, but it's not on the road we are driving on.
