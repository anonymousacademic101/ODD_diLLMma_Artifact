The sign visible on the right side of the image indicates "Lakeshore Lane Reductions Spadina to Simcoe Oct. 31-Nov. 19," which suggests that during the period mentioned, there is construction work that has led to the reduction of available lanes on the road. This implies that there is construction on the road we are "driving on."
