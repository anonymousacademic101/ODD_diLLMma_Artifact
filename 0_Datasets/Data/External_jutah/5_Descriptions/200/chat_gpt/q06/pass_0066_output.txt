The presence of orange traffic cones and barriers near the sidewalk suggests that there is some form of construction or roadwork happening adjacent to the driving lanes. Although the driving lanes appear clear, these indicators typically denote areas where construction is occurring or will occur, which may impact road use. Additionally, a sign on the sidewalk, though not readable, resembles the type commonly used to indicate construction zones.
