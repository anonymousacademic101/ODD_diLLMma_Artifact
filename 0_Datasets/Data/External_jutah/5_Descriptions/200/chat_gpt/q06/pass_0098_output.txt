NO

In the image provided, there are no visible signs of construction such as cones, barriers, construction vehicles, or workers on the road itself. However, there are multiple cranes and what looks like construction of buildings in the background, which is not on the road but rather at a distance from it. The road appears to be free of any construction activity.
