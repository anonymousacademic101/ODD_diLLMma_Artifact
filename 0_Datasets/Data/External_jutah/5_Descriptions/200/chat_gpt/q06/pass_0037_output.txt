YES

There are visible signs of road construction on the road we are driving on. This is evident by the presence of orange traffic cones sectioning off a part of the lane to the right, which is a common indicator used to signal construction zones or areas where work is being performed on the road. Also, to the left of the image, there appears to be a construction barrier with flashing lights, usually put in place to warn drivers of road work ahead.
