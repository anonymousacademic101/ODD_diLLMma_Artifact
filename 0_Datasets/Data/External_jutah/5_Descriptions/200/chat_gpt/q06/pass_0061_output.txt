While the road surface itself does not appear to be under construction, there are visible signs of construction along the side of the road. There is scaffolding covering the sidewalk on the left, and there is a crane in the distance, indicating construction activity nearby. Construction vehicles and barriers can also be associated with road construction or impacts on traffic flow.
