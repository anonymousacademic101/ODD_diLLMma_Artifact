Although there is no active construction seen, such as machinery or workers, the presence of barriers and cones along the side of the road, as well as changes to the lane markings, suggest that there may be ongoing construction, or at least preparations for it. The dirt area to the right looks recently disturbed, which could be related to construction activities.
