NO

The image provided shows a parking area rather than a road, and there is no visible construction on the parking lot itself. There are some portable toilets and what appears to be a fenced-off area in the distance, which may indicate construction nearby, but not on the area where vehicles are seen, which seems to be used for parking rather than active driving.
