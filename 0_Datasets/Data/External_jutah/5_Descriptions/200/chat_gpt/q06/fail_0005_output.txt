NO.

In the image provided, there is no visible construction equipment, signage, or barriers that would indicate active road construction on the road that is being driven on. The roadway appears clear of construction activity, and traffic seems to flow normally. However, there does seem to be some construction activity on a building on the left side of the road, but this does not affect the roadway itself.
