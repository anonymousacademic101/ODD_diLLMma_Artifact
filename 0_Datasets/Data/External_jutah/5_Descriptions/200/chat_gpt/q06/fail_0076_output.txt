NO

The visible section of the road in the image does not show any signs of construction taking place directly on it. There are no construction barriers, equipment, or obvious construction activity on the road itself. However, there are construction materials and a work truck parked on the side near the building, indicating construction activity may be occurring nearby or even on that building, but this does not affect the road directly.
