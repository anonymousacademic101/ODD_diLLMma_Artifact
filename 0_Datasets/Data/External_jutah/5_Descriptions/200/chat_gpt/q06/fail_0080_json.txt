The vehicles appear to be moving normally, suggesting that the flow of traffic is not currently being affected by construction activities. However, I must note that due to the limited field of view and the night setting, it's possible that construction could be taking place outside of the visible area or might be subtle and not immediately obvious."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
