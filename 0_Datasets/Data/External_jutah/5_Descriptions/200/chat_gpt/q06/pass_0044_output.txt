The presence of construction can be inferred due to several indicators: there are barriers on the right side, indicating a sectioned-off area, and there is construction-related signage visible. Additionally, there is a construction vehicle with a flashing arrow sign directing traffic away from the area, which typically signals construction activity or road work ahead.
