The presence of orange traffic cones, visible signage stating "ROAD CLOSED" and "CONSTRUCTION AHEAD," combined with the barrier in the street all indicate that there is indeed construction on the road depicted in the image. The road closure signs and the redirection of traffic also suggest that the construction is significant enough to impact the normal flow of traffic.
