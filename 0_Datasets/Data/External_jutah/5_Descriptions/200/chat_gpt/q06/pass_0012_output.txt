YES

There is evidence of construction on the road. This is indicated by the presence of an orange construction sign leaned against the fence on the right side of the road, which typically denotes road work or construction activity nearby. Additionally, there seem to be orange cones set up further down the road past the traffic light that can also suggest construction or roadwork in that area.
