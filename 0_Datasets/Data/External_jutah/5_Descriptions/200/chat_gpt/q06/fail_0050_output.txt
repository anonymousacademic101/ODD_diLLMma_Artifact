The photo shows several indicators of road construction: there are orange and white barriers (commonly used to demarcate construction zones), construction cones, and the presence of a fenced-in area to the side of the road where work appears to be taking place. Additionally, there is visible construction equipment and signage that typically accompany roadwork.
