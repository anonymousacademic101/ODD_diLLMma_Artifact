YES.

The road depicted in the image seems to have some construction or maintenance activity going on. This is indicated by the presence of visible orange traffic cones forming a line that cuts off a portion of the road on the right side, which typically signifies that a lane is closed off for construction or a similar disruption. Additionally, there's a work trailer parked on the side of the road within the area cordoned off by the cones, further suggesting some kind of construction or maintenance work.
