NO

Based on the visible areas of the image, there are no clear indications of any construction activity such as road work signs, cones, barriers, construction vehicles, or workers on the road we are driving on. The traffic flow appears to be obstructed only by standard vehicle congestion at a red traffic light, rather than construction disruption.
