NO

The image shows a city street where vehicles are moving normally, and there is no visible sign of construction taking place on the road itself. However, there appears to be scaffolding along the building to the left, suggesting construction or maintenance work on the building facade. The road, as far as we can see in the image, is clear of construction equipment or work zones.
