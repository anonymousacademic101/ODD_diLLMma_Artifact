The image shows an orange sign with an arrow indicating a detour or a change in the lane configuration, which is commonly used to signal changes due to construction. Additionally, there are visible barricades with reflective stripes on the sidewalk, indicating that there may be ongoing construction ahead or nearby. While the construction itself is not directly visible on the road we are on, these signs typically imply that some form of construction is affecting the road.
