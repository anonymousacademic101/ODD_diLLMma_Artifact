YES

The reason is that there's a sign visible which indicates that there's no left turn allowed from 7 AM to 7 PM daily, and that electric vehicles are excepted from this restriction. While the sign doesn't indicate a "lane" that is restricted, it does imply a restriction that pertains to the use of a part of the road (in this case, making a left turn) during certain hours, and that exception exists for electric vehicles. This can often be indicative of an aim to improve traffic flow or prioritize certain types of vehicles, which is in line with the concept of restricted lanes, albeit not a permanent lane restriction.
