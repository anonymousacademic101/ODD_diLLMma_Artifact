We can tell that it is likely a bus lane due to the color of the pavement (which is commonly used to denote bus lanes in various regions) and there is a bus currently using this lane. There may be additional indicators or signs out of the frame that provide more explicit instructions, but the visual cues present in the photo suggest that there is a restricted lane dedicated for buses. There is no clear signage or demarcation visible in the image that indicates a bicycle lane on the road we are viewing.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
