YES

The image shows that there is a lane dedicated for buses on the right-hand side of the road. This can be determined by the signage visible above the road that displays a white symbol of a bus on a blue background, which is conventionally used to indicate a bus lane. The specific regulatory details such as the hours of operation for the bus lane cannot be ascertained from this image, but the presence of the sign alone confirms the existence of a restricted bus lane. No specific markings for a bicycle lane are visible in this image, but that does not exclude the possibility of such a lane outside of the field of view. However, based solely on the information provided in this image, we can confirm the presence of a bus lane.
