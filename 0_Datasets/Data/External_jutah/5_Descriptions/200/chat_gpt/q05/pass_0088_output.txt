YES

The road signs in the image indicate a restriction for a particular type of lane. The overhead sign shows a symbol that is commonly used to designate lanes for buses. The specific lane is likely on the road overhead rather than the one we are driving on. There are no visible indications of dedicated bicycle lanes on the road we are driving on in the image provided. However, the sign showing a lane reserved for buses suggests there are restricted lanes, albeit part of the transit infrastructure not directly visible in the current frame of the road being driven on.
