There appears to be a sign above the right side of the road that indicates some kind of restriction. The sign is not completely clear in the image provided, but it seems to indicate that the lane is reserved for a specific purpose during certain hours, which is consistent with typical signage for bus lanes or other restricted lanes in urban areas. Further direct observation or local knowledge would be necessary to confirm the exact nature of the restriction.
