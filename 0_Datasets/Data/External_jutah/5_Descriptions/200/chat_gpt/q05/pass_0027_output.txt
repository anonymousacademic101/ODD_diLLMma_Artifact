The image shows a bus from "transitchicago.com" operating in the lane adjacent to the curb, which suggests that at least during certain times of the day this lane could be designated as a bus lane. However, without more contextual information such as road markings, signs, or local traffic regulations being visible in this image, it is not possible to definitively say whether the lane is exclusively restricted to buses. Typically, cities with significant bus traffic will have lanes that are either fully dedicated to bus traffic or are restricted during peak hours to ensure the efficient flow of public transit.
