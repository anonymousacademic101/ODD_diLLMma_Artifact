NO

In the provided image, there is no clear indication of any lanes that are explicitly restricted for buses, bicycles, or other specific types of vehicles. The visible road markings and signs do not show any lane restrictions. There are no signs or road surface markings that are typically used to designate bus lanes (such as "BUS ONLY" markings or specific colored lanes) or bike lanes (such as bicycle symbols or separate lanes with a different surface treatment). Therefore, based on this image, it cannot be confirmed that there are restricted lanes on this road.
