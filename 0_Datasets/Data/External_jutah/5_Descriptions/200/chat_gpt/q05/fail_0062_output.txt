YES.

There appears to be a red-colored lane on the road which is typically used to denote lanes reserved for certain types of vehicles. In many urban areas, red lanes are often designated for buses to improve the efficiency and reliability of public transit. Additionally, this red lane might also be shared with bicycles, as indicated by the cyclist present in the lane. However, without explicit signage visible in the image, we can't be completely certain of the specific restrictions or allowances for this lane, but it does seem to be a lane with some sort of restriction.
