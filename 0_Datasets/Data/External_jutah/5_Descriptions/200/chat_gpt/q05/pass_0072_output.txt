The image appears to show a road with a red-colored bus lane on the right side. You can tell it's likely a bus lane due to its distinctive red coloring, which is a common practice in various cities to denote lanes designated for bus traffic to improve public transportation efficiency and reliability. There does not appear to be a designated bicycle lane in the visible part of the image, but the bus lane might also accommodate bicycles depending on local traffic regulations.
