YES.

The reason is that the image shows a street with visible road markings indicating a bike lane on the right side of the road. The green painted pavement and white bicycle symbols designate this lane as reserved for bicyclists. Additionally, the presence of a bus in the image suggests that there may be a bus stop or bus lane nearby; however, the image does not show a dedicated bus lane with clear markings on the asphalt. The bike lane is the clearly restricted lane for bicycles.
