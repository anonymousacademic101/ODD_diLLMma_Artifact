NO.

In the image provided, we see a tunnel with lanes marked for vehicles. There are no visible signs or markings indicating the presence of restricted lanes designated for buses or bicycles. The lanes shown are being used by standard motor vehicles, and the lane markings suggest these are regular traffic lanes, with speed limits indicated for vehicular traffic. The lack of bus or bicycle lane markings, as well as the tunnel context (where bus or bicycle lanes are less common), supports the conclusion that there are no restricted lanes in this particular section of the road.
