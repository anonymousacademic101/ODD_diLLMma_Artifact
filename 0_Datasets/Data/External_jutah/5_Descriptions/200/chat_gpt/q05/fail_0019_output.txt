The image shows a railway crossing, which is a type of restricted lane. The crossing gates and railway traffic signals are designed to control vehicle and pedestrian traffic to ensure safety when a train is approaching. While this is not specifically a bus or bicycle lane, it is nonetheless a part of the road where access is controlled and restricted based on railway traffic, thus fitting the broader definition of a restricted lane.
