This suggests that there is a lane designated for buses, and hence, there is at least one type of restricted lane on this road. Given the level of traffic congestion and the specifics of the sign being only partially visible, I cannot provide further details on the specifics of the restriction, like hours of operation or whether there could be additional restrictions.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
