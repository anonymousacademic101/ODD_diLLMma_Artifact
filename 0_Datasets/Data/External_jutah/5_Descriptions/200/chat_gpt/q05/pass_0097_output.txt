Although it's not visible in this specific image, there are signs that indicate the presence of a bus lane. To the right side of the road, there is a blue sign with a white "30" symbol, supporting a red circle with what appears to be a bus symbol inside it. This typically signifies a bus lane restriction, indicating that the far right lane may be reserved for buses. Additionally, there is another blue sign with a bicycle symbol, which suggests there might be a bicycle lane or a shared lane for bicycles nearby. These signs are commonly used to indicate dedicated lanes for specific types of vehicles like buses and bicycles, but without seeing the actual road markings or signs in full detail, it's not possible to precisely determine the restrictions or their extent.
