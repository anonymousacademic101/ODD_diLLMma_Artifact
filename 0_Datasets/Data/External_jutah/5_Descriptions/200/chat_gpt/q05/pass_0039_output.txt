NO.

Based on the visible lanes in the image, there are no indications that suggest the existence of any lanes restricted solely for buses, bicycles, or other specific vehicle types. All lanes appear to be open for general vehicle traffic, with no signage or road markings indicating a restriction. However, the road is undergoing construction, as evidenced by the presence of cones and barriers, which might alter or limit normal lane usage temporarily.
