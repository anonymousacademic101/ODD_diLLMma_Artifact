The road in the image has a dedicated tram or streetcar lane, evidenced by the tracks running down the middle of the roadway. This lane is typically restricted for the use of trams or streetcars only, and other vehicles are usually not allowed to drive in this lane except when necessary to make permitted turns or to access driveways. There is no specific indication of a bus lane, but the streetcar lane itself is a type of restricted lane. Additionally, we can observe a bicycle lane to the right side of the road, where cyclists are riding. This lane is marked with bicycle symbols on the pavement and is reserved for bicycle traffic.
