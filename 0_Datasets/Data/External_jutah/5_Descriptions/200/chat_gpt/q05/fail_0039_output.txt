NO

The image shows a deteriorated and possibly abandoned area with no visible traffic signs or lane markings that would indicate any restrictions for specific types of vehicles such as buses or bicycles. The road surface is in poor condition, and there are clear signs indicating "NO TRESPASSING" and "DO NOT ENTER," suggesting that this is not an active road for any kind of traffic. Therefore, it does not have designated restricted lanes for certain types of vehicles.
