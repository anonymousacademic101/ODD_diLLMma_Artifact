YES.

In the image provided, there appears to be a lane with markings and signs indicating that it is reserved for specific types of traffic, such as streetcars or buses. There is a sign with a streetcar icon, suggesting that at least one lane is dedicated for the use of streetcars or trams. Additionally, there is pavement marking that typically denotes a special lane, supporting the existence of a restricted lane. The clear separation of this lane from the rest of the traffic lanes, as well as the signals and signage, indicate it is not a general-purpose lane for all vehicles.
