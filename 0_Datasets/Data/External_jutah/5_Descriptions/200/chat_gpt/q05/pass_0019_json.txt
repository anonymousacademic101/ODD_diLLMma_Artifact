The lanes are marked with standard white lines, and there are no visible indicators such as bus symbols, bicycle symbols, or colored lanes that would typically denote a restricted lane. However, it's important to note that without a full 360-degree view or additional signage outside the frame, this assessment is based only on the visible section of the road."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
