The specific markings for bus or bicycle lanes are not clearly visible in the image provided, but the existence of a wide crossing area with dashed lines suggests that this is an area with a potential for designated lanes for different types of road users. In many urban environments, such design features often accompany lanes that are restricted for bicycles, buses, or other vehicles to enhance safety and efficiency.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
