YES

Based on the visible docking station of bicycles on the sidewalk, it is reasonable to assume there might be a bicycle lane nearby, even though it is not directly visible in the image provided. Cities often incorporate bike share stations along with designated bike lanes to encourage cycling as a mode of transportation. However, without a clear view of the road markings or signs specifically indicating a bicycle lane on the road, this is an assumption based on contextual information. There is no explicit evidence of a bus lane in the portion of the street that is visible.
