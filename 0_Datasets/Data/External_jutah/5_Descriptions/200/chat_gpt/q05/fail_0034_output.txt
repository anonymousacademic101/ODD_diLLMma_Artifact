The visible lanes in the image do not show any specific signage or road markings that indicate restrictions for specific types of vehicles, such as dedicated bus lanes or bicycle lanes. The lanes appear to be general traffic lanes, although there are standard traffic signals and pedestrian crossing signals visible, which emphasize general traffic control rather than restrictions for specific vehicle types.
