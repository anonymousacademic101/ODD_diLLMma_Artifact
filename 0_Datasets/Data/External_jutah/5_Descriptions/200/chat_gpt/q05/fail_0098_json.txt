The lane is marked with a sign that clearly indicates bus priority (a symbol of a bus inside a blue rectangle), which is visible on the signpost to the right. This implies that the lane is specifically reserved for buses, and possibly other authorized vehicles, but not for general traffic. There is no visible indication of a bicycle lane in the image, so any statement about a bicycle lane would be speculative.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
