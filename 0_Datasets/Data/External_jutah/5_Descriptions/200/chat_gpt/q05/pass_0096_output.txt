The image shows a road with vehicles driving at night. On the left side of the image, there is a separate lane that is marked off by yellow poles. This type of separation and marking is typically indicative of a lane that is restricted for specific use, such as a bus lane, a bike lane, or some other form of priority or restricted access lane. The absence of cars in that marked lane, in contrast with the mixed traffic in the adjacent lanes, supports the indication that it is a restricted lane.
