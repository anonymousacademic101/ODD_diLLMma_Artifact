NO

Based on the image provided, there are no visible signs or road markings that indicate the presence of a restricted lane such as a bus lane or bicycle lane on the visible portion of the road. We can see multiple vehicles, including a van and some cars, traveling in lanes without any indications that any of these lanes are reserved for specific types of traffic. Additionally, there are no bicycle lane markings visible in the image. It is important to note, however, that the entire stretch of road and all potential markings are not fully visible, so this assessment is based on the visible part of the image.
