This suggests that there is at least one type of restricted lane on the road. Additionally, there is a distinct lack of cars on the tracks, which supports the notion that it is not a general traffic lane. The presence of what appears to be a platform to the right of the tracks indicates that this road facilitates a public transit system likely with restricted access to the tracks, reserved for streetcars or trams.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
