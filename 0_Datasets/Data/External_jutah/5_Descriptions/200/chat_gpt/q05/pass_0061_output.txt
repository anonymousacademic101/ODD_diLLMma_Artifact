In the image, there appears to be a red painted area on the curb to the left which is often indicative of a bus lane or a lane with some form of restriction. Additionally, there are diamond symbols painted on the roadway within this lane, which typically denote a lane designated for specific types of vehicles, such as buses or other high-occupancy vehicles. However, without clear signage visible in the image, it's not possible to confirm the specific restrictions or to whom they apply.
