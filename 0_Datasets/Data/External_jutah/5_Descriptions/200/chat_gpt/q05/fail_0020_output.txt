YES

The road in the image has a sign indicating a lane restriction. On the right-most side of the road, there is a sign posted near the sidewalk that shows a symbol of a bicycle, signifying that there is a bicycle lane. Thus, this lane is restricted for the use of bicycles. The rest of the road appears to be a typical roadway without any visible signs of other special lane restrictions such as for buses. However, the presence of the school bus on the road does not necessarily indicate a bus-only lane; it may simply be using the same lanes as other vehicles.
