Based on the image provided, it appears that there is a restricted lane marked with signage indicating it is for buses only. The sign is visible to the right side of the road, just beyond the intersection, where it's marked with the words "BUS ONLY." This lane restriction is typically in place to improve the efficiency of public transportation by providing designated lanes for buses to travel without interference from regular traffic.
