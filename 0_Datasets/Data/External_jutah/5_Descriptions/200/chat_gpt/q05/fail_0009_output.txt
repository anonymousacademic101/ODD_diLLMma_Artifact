YES

The image shows a sign that indicates a restriction for turning on red except from the right lane, which suggests that the right lane might have a specific function or restriction. While this does not explicitly mark the lane as a bus or bicycle lane, the restriction indicates that the rightmost lane could be reserved for certain types of vehicles or maneuvers, possibly indicating a form of restricted lane usage. To determine the exact nature of the restriction, more information or additional signage in the vicinity would need to be observed.
