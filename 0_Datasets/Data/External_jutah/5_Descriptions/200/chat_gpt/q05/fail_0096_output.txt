NO

The image provided does not clearly show any signs for restricted lanes, such as those designated for buses or bicycles. The road appears to have a few lanes for vehicular traffic without any specific restrictions visible in the image. However, without further signs or road markings that are visible in this image, I cannot confirm the presence of any restricted lanes.
