YES

While I cannot make out specific markings or signs that denote a bus or bicycle lane from this angle, the presence of a scooter dock on the right-hand side of the road and the "WAIT FOR GREEN" sign could indicate that there are potential restrictions or traffic signals relevant to cyclists or other forms of transportation. Without a clearer view or additional context, we cannot definitively conclude the nature of these restrictions, but such infrastructure often coincides with lanes or areas designated for specific types of vehicles, such as buses or bicycles.
