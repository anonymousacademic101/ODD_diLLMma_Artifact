The road in the image has a restricted lane designated for bicycles. There appears to be a bike lane on the right side of the road, marked by white lines and bicycle symbols within the lane. Additionally, there are flexible bollards separating the bike lane from the rest of the roadway to provide cyclists with a measure of protection from the vehicular traffic lanes.
