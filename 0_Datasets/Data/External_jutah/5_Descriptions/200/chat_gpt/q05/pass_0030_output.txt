YES

In the image provided, to the right side of the road, there is a sign posted high on a pole, indicating "BUS STOP" and showing a bus icon. This implies the presence of a bus lane or at least a bus stop, which is a type of restricted lane intended for the exclusive or primary use of buses. Moreover, there appears to be a separate lane marked with white lines that seems to be dedicated for such a purpose, although the full extent or regulations of the lane cannot be determined solely from this image. The presence of the sign itself, however, supports the indication of a restricted area for buses. There is no clear indication of a bicycle lane in this particular frame of the image.
