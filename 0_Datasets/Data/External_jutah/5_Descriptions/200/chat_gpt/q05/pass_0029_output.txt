YES

From what can be seen in the image, the road has a dedicated bus lane on the right, indicated by the words "BUS ONLY" painted on the roadway. There are no visible markings or signs indicating a bicycle lane in the immediate view. The restricted bus lane is designed to improve public transport efficiency by reducing bus travel times and minimizing their delays caused by general traffic congestion.
