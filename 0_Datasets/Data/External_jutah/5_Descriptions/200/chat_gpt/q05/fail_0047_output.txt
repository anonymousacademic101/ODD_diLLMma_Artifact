The image provided does not depict a roadway where we are driving, and therefore it is not possible to determine if there are restricted lanes such as bus or bicycle lanes. Instead, the image shows a stationary scene in a parking lot adjacent to a water body, without any clear view of a road with traffic lanes or signs indicating such restrictions.
