NO.

Based on the image provided, I cannot see any specific indications such as road markings or signage that designate particular lanes as restricted solely for buses, bicycles, or other specific types of vehicles. The visible area shows a general traffic lane with vehicles parked on the side of the road and no clear signs of lane restrictions.
