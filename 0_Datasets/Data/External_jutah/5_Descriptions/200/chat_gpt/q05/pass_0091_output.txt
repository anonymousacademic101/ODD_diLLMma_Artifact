YES

While the image displays a typical urban traffic scene during what appears to be rush hour, with several lanes of vehicles and no immediately obvious lane markings distinguishing restricted lanes, there is a sign on the right side - partially obscured by a tree - that has a symbol often associated with bus lanes. This suggests that there is a lane designated for buses, and hence, there is at least one type of restricted lane on this road. Given the level of traffic congestion and the specifics of the sign being only partially visible, I cannot provide further details on the specifics of the restriction, like hours of operation or whether there could be additional restrictions.
