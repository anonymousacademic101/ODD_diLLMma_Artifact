The sign looks like it might be designating a bus lane, as is often found in urban areas to prioritize public transportation. However, the image does not provide a clear view of the entire road, so the exact nature of any restrictions cannot be confirmed. Additionally, the quality of the image is such that specific lane markings or additional signage cannot be seen with certainty.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
