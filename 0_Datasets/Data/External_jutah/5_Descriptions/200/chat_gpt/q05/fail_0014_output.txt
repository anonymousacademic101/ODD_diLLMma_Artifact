YES

Based on the visible road markings and signage, there appears to be a red-painted curb area indicating that there are restrictions for stopping, standing, or parking in the immediate vicinity of the intersection. This often indicates a fire lane or a bus stop. However, there are no clearly visible markings or signs indicating a dedicated bus lane or bicycle lane on the section of the road that is visible in this image. Therefore, while there are restricted areas, they do not appear to be designated lanes for buses or bicycles.
