NO.

Based on the visible markings and signs in this image, there do not appear to be any lanes specifically designated as restricted for specific types of vehicles such as buses or bicycles. The lanes are marked with standard white lines, and there are no visible indicators such as bus symbols, bicycle symbols, or colored lanes that would typically denote a restricted lane. However, it's important to note that without a full 360-degree view or additional signage outside the frame, this assessment is based only on the visible section of the road.
