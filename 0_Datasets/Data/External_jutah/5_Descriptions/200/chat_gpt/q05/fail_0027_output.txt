YES

The presence of the blue "Electric Bus" indicates that this road is likely to be used by buses as part of a public transportation network. While I cannot see explicit signage or road markings in the image that designate a particular lane as "bus-only," it's common in urban areas to find lanes that are reserved for buses, often during peak hours to facilitate public transport movement. However, without clear signs or road markings visible in the image, we cannot definitively confirm the presence of a bus-only lane. As far as bicycle lanes go, there is no visible indication of a bike lane in this particular scene.
