The image shows road signage that indicates turning lanes, and on the far right, there's a sign with a bicycle symbol and an arrow, suggesting that there is a designated bike lane or bike route. Additionally, road markings for lanes often include special designations for bus or bike lanes, and based on the presence of the bike route sign, one can infer that there is a restriction for a lane dedicated to bicycles.
