The image shows a road with tram or streetcar tracks running along the lanes. These tracks typically indicate that there is a designated lane for public transit vehicles, such as trams or streetcars. This can be considered a type of restricted lane as it is intended primarily for the use of a specific type of vehicle. Additionally, there is a sign indicating "Lane Reductions", which may temporarily change normal traffic patterns, but does not directly indicate permanent restrictions for buses or bicycles.
