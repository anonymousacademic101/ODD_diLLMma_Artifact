YES

Based on the visible road markings and signage, it appears that the lane on the right is restricted for certain types of vehicles or maneuvers. The sign clearly states "RIGHT LANE MUST TURN RIGHT," which indicates that the rightmost lane is designated for right-turning vehicles only. There are no visible indicators of a bus or bicycle lane in this image, but the mentioned restriction for right turns applies to one of the lanes.
