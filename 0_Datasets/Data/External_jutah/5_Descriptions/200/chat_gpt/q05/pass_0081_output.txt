The image shows tram or streetcar tracks in the center of the road, which generally indicates a dedicated lane for these types of vehicles. This suggests that there is at least one type of restricted lane on the road. Additionally, there is a distinct lack of cars on the tracks, which supports the notion that it is not a general traffic lane. The presence of what appears to be a platform to the right of the tracks indicates that this road facilitates a public transit system likely with restricted access to the tracks, reserved for streetcars or trams.
