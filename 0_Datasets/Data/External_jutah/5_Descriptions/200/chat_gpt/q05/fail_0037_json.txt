Although the specific restricted lanes such as for buses or bicycles are not visible in this photograph, the presence of orange traffic cones and construction signage ("ROAD WORK AHEAD") suggests that there are lanes restricted due to road work. These types of restrictions typically signify that one or more lanes are designated for construction vehicles or are closed to regular traffic, making them restricted lanes by definition.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
