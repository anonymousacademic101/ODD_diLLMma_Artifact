NO

From the visible information in the image provided, there do not appear to be any dedicated lanes marked explicitly for buses, bicycles, or other specific types of traffic on the road ahead. There are no indications of a bus lane or bike lane in the section of the road we can see; no signage or road markings specific to restricted lanes are visible. However, there is a sign indicating "NO TURNS EXCEPT BUSES," which implies a restriction for turning movements, rather than a dedicated lane.
