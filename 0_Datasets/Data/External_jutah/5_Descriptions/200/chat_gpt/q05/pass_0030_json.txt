This implies the presence of a bus lane or at least a bus stop, which is a type of restricted lane intended for the exclusive or primary use of buses. Moreover, there appears to be a separate lane marked with white lines that seems to be dedicated for such a purpose, although the full extent or regulations of the lane cannot be determined solely from this image. The presence of the sign itself, however, supports the indication of a restricted area for buses. There is no clear indication of a bicycle lane in this particular frame of the image.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
