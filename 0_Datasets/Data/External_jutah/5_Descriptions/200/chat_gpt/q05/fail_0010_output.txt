NO.

The image presented shows a roadway with multiple lanes, and from what is visible, there are no indications of any lanes being designated as restricted for specific types of vehicles such as buses or bicycles. There are no signs or road markings visible that denote a restricted lane. However, the view is limited, and without a fuller view of the surroundings, including traffic signs and road markings beyond what is visible, it is not possible to conclusively determine if restricted lanes are present outside of the photographed area.
