YES

The image presents a road with different lanes, and one of the lanes is marked with a sign hanging overhead that appears to indicate it is for buses only. There are also buses visible in the image utilizing that lane, which supports the conclusion that it is a bus-only lane, effectively making it a restricted lane. I cannot certify the presence of a bicycle lane as it is not clearly visible in the image provided.
