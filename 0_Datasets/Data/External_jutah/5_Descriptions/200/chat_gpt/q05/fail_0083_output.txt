YES.

The road in the image has tram or streetcar tracks running down the middle, which indicates that there is a dedicated lane for this type of public transportation. These lanes are typically restricted for the exclusive use of the tram or streetcar services, and other vehicles are often prohibited from driving on them except when making permitted turns or when necessary, subject to local traffic regulations.
