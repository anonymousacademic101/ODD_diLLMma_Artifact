NO.

The image does not show extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight into the camera. The sky is partially overcast with some sunlight filtering through the clouds, but there is no indication of direct sunlight impairing the image's visibility, nor are there visible effects like lens flare or overexposure that would suggest a strong light source pointed directly at the camera. Additionally, the headlights of oncoming vehicles do not appear to be on, or if they are, they are not bright enough to be considered "extremely bright."
