The lights visible in the image are primarily from streetlights, traffic signals, and vehicle tail lights, which are not producing glare or intense brightness that would significantly impair vision. No direct sunlight is evident, and no oncoming headlights are producing extreme brightness that could be characterized as blinding or exceptionally intense. The ambient lighting appears to be relatively well-balanced without any harsh light sources directed into the camera lens.
