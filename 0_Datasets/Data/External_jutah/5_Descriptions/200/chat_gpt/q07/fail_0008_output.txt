NO

The image provided appears to be taken during daylight with overcast skies, which generally results in diffuse, even lighting. There are no apparent bright lights from oncoming traffic, as there are no other vehicles facing the camera that have their headlights on. Additionally, there is no evidence of direct sunlight shining into the camera, which would typically cause lens flare or significant portions of the image to be overexposed. Instead, the lighting in the image is subdued and there are no harsh reflections or bright light sources that would imply the presence of extremely bright lights.
