The image shows a clear daytime scene without any extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight glaring into the camera. The sky is blue with a few light clouds, and the sun is not visible in the frame, suggesting it is not pointing directly into the camera lens. There are no visible vehicles with headlights on that are bright enough to be considered extreme. The overall lighting is consistent with natural daylight conditions.
