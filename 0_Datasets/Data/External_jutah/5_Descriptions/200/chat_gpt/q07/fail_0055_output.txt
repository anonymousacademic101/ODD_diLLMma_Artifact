The image shows a street scene during twilight with various artificial lights from street lamps, vehicle headlights, and illuminated signs. However, none of these lights are "extremely bright" to the point where they would cause significant glare or overexposure in the camera. The lights appear to be well within the dynamic range of the photograph, and there is no evidence of direct sunlight as the sky is darkening, indicating the sun has either set or is not directly shining into the camera.
