The image shows a sunny day in an urban setting with parked cars lining the street and a bridge in the background. The sunlight is generally bright but there are no extreme lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight glaring into the camera. The lighting appears natural and does not cause any significant glare or overexposure in the photo.
