The image appears to be taken during overcast or possibly hazy conditions, which results in more diffused lighting. There are no signs of direct sunlight casting harsh shadows or causing glare. Moreover, there are no visible bright lights from oncoming headlights that would be considered extremely bright or blinding. All vehicles present in the image have their headlights off, or at a brightness level that does not cause any intense glare or light flares in the camera's lens.
