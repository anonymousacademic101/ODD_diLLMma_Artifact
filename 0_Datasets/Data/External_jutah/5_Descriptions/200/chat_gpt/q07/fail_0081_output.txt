NO

The image is taken at night in an urban setting, and while there are multiple sources of ambient light such as streetlamps, illuminated windows, and vehicle headlights, none of these lights are extremely bright or directed into the camera in a way that would cause significant glare or overexposure. There is no indication of direct sunlight since it is night, and the headlights visible in the image appear to be captured without causing excessive brightness, possibly due to the camera settings used for nighttime photography.
