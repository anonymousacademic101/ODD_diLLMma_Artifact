NO.

This image appears to be taken in daylight with natural ambient light. There are no visible oncoming headlights that are extremely bright, nor is there evidence of direct sunlight into the camera causing significant glare or overexposure. The shadows on the ground suggest a clear sky with the sun positioned to illuminate the scene evenly without harsh direct light into the lens.
