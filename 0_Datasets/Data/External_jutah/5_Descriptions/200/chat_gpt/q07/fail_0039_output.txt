NO.

There are no extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights, or direct sunlight into the camera. The image appears to be taken during daytime with overcast sky or during dusk/dawn without any strong light source directly facing the camera, and there are no visible headlights in the scene. It's a picture of an abandoned building with some vegetation, and the lighting seems to be quite ambient and diffused.
