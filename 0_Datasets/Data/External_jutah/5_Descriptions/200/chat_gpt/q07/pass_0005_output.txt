NO.

The image appears to be taken during the day under overcast or cloudy conditions, which means there is diffused natural light. There is no evidence of extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights, as the vehicles in the image do not have their headlights on, and there is no harsh direct sunlight evident in the scene because there are no strong shadows or signs of bright sunlight hitting the camera lens.
