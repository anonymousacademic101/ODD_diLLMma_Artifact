In the image provided, the headlights from oncoming vehicles are visible but they are not extremely bright or causing significant glare that would distort the image. There is no direct sunlight visible as the setting appears to be during twilight hours, where the sun has already set or is not directly shining into the camera. Thus, the lighting conditions seem to be typical of an urban environment during early evening with artificial street and vehicle lighting.
