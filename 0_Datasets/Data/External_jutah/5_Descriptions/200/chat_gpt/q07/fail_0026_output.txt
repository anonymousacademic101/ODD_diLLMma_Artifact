NO

There are no bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight glaring into the camera in this image. The scene depicts an overcast or possibly early morning/late evening street view with diffuse lighting, so there is no harsh light coming from the vehicles or the environment that would fall under the description of "extremely bright lights."
