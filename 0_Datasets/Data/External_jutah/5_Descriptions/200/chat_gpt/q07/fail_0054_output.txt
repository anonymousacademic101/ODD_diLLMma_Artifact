NO.

The image shows a street scene during daytime with an overcast sky, which naturally diffuses light. There are no harsh bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight into the camera, as the headlights of visible vehicles are not turned on and the sun is not in direct view of the camera lens. The lighting appears even and there are no signs of glare or overexposure that would be associated with extremely bright lights.
