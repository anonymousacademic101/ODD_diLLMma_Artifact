The image shows nighttime city traffic with illuminated signage and street lights. The lights from oncoming vehicles and those in the scene are typical for nighttime traffic and do not appear to be extremely bright or causing significant glare.

The headlights and other artificial lights present appear to be within normal brightness levels for such conditions, neither overexposed nor excessively bright in the context of the photo.
