NO

The image depicts a scene during twilight with no extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights, or direct sunlight into the camera. The ambient light is soft and even, and while there are some vehicle headlights visible, they are not overpowering or glaring into the lens of the camera. There are also no indications of direct sunlight, as the sky is relatively dim, indicating the sun is either set or not in direct view of the camera's angle.
