NO.

The photo shows a street scene with clear visibility. The lighting in the image is even and there are no signs of glare from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight into the camera. The vehicles' headlights are not on or not bright enough to cause glare, and the sun does not appear to be directly facing the camera lens. The shadows indicate the sun is behind the buildings or positioned high in the sky.
