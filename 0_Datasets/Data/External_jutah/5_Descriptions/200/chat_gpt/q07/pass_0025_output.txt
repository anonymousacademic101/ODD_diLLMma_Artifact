NO.

The image appears to be taken during daylight with clear visibility, and there are no signs of direct sunlight into the camera lens that would cause glare or extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights. The sky is bright but not overwhelmingly so, and the shadows indicate the sun is higher in the sky, reducing the likelihood of direct sunlight into the lens.
