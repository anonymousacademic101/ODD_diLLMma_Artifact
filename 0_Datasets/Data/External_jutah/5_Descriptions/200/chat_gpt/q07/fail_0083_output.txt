The image shows a city street at night with various light sources, such as street lamps and illuminated windows, which provide a balanced lighting environment without any extremely bright lights that cause glare or overexposure in the photo. There are no headlights pointing directly into the camera at an intensity that could be considered "extremely bright," nor is there direct sunlight, as it is nighttime.
