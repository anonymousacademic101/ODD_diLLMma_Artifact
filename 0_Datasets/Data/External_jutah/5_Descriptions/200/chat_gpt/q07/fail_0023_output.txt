NO

There are no extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights, nor is there direct sunlight into the camera that would cause glare or significant visual obstruction. The image is evenly lit with a diffuse, overcast light, typical of a cloudy day or early morning/evening light, which does not present harsh brightness or contrast.
