The image does not contain extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight. The lighting appears even and diffuse, suggesting an overcast sky, and there are no signs of lens flare or other indications of bright lights facing the camera. There are visible headlights from vehicles, but none are bright enough to be considered "extremely bright" or causing a glare.
