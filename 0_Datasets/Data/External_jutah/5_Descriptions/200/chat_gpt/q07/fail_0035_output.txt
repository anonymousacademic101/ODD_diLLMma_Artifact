The lights from the oncoming vehicles are visible but not extremely bright, and there does not appear to be any direct sunlight shining into the camera. The scene is overcast, suggesting a lack of direct sunlight, and the headlight beams are diffused, typical for a rainy or misty environment, which does not cause extreme brightness in the image.
