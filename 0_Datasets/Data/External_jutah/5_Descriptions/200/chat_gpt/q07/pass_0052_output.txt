The image shows a city street scene at twilight or night with various light sources, including vehicle headlights, street lights, and illuminated signage. While some of the headlights from oncoming traffic are visible, they are not extremely bright nor causing significant glare or overexposure. The lighting appears well-balanced, without any direct sunlight or overpoweringly bright lights that would obscure the scene or cause difficulty viewing the image.
