NO

The lighting in the image is diffuse and there are no evident extremely bright lights from either oncoming headlights or direct sunlight into the camera. The ambient lighting appears to be even, likely from an overcast sky or a time of day when the sun is not shining directly into the lens. There are some visible headlights from cars, but they are not overly bright or glaring.
