NO.

The image appears to be taken inside a tunnel, where naturally there would be no direct sunlight, and the headlights of the oncoming vehicles are not captured as extremely bright lights due to the camera's exposure settings or the angle at which the photo is taken. The lights present are typical of internal vehicle lights reflecting off the tunnel's surface, and there's no indication of significant glare or overexposure that would suggest extreme brightness.
