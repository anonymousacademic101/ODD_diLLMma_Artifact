NO

There are no extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights, or direct sunlight into the camera in this image. The sky is overcast, and there don't appear to be any direct or reflective light sources that would cause extreme brightness or glare in the photo. All vehicles have their headlights off and the ambient lighting seems even without any harsh light sources.
