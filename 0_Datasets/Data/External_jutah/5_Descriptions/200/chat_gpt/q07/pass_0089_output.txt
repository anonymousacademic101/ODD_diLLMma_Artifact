NO

The image shows a night-time city street scene with various vehicles and street lights, but there are no extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight into the camera. The headlights and tail lights of the cars are visible but are not producing glare that would suggest extreme brightness. The illumination in the photo is typical of what you would expect in an urban setting at night.
