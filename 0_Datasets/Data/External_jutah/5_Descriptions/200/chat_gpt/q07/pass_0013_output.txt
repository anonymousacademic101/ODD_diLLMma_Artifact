NO.

The image depicts an overcast day with no visible extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights, nor is there direct sunlight into the camera. The lighting looks quite diffuse due to the cloud cover, which softens any shadows and reduces the contrast usually associated with bright sunlight. There is no glare or strong reflections that would suggest the presence of bright lights or direct sunlight.
