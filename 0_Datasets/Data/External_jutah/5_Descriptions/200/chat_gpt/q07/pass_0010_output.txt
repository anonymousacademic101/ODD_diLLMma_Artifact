The image appears to be taken during daytime in well-lit conditions without any glare from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight that would be considered "extremely bright" and potentially blinding to the camera. The sky is blue and clear, and the sunlight visible is typical for a sunny day without causing any significant glare or overexposure in the photo.
