NO

There are no extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight overwhelming the camera in this image. The lighting appears to be even and natural, suitable for the street view captured, without glaring or direct intense light sources hitting the camera lens. The photo seems to be taken on an overcast or partially sunny day, with diffuse lighting conditions, and there are no visible headlight beams from vehicles that would cause extreme brightness.
