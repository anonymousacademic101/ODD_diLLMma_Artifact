The lighting appears to be evenly distributed though it is a bright day, and while there's a presence of sunlight, it is not creating intense glare or harsh lighting conditions in the photo. The sun's position seems quite high, thus not shining directly into the lens, and the vehicle headlights are not turned on or bright enough to cause glare."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
