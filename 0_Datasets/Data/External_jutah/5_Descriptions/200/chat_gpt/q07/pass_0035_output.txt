NO

The lighting in the image appears to be even and there are no signs of extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight into the camera that would cause glare or high levels of brightness that obscure the visibility. The sky is overcast, providing diffused lighting conditions, and while there are oncoming vehicles, their headlights do not seem to be on or bright enough to create an intense glare.
