NO.

The lighting in this image appears even and there are no signs of extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight that are causing glare or significantly affecting the exposure of the photo. The street is in soft shadow, and while there is a brighter area suggesting daylight, it is not directly shining into the camera in a way that would be considered extremely bright or glaring.
