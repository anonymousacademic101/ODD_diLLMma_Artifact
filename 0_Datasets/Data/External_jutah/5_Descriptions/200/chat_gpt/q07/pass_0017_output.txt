NO

There are no extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight into the camera in this image. The vehicles in the scene do not have their headlights on, and the sunlight appears to be coming from above and behind the camera's perspective, casting shadows on the ground that indicate the sun is behind the scene. The lighting is relatively even across the image without any harsh glare or reflections that would indicate extremely bright light sources.
