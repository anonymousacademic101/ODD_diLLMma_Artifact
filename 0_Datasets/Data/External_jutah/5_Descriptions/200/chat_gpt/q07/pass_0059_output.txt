The image provided does not contain any extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight into the camera. The scene is evenly lit, suggesting it is either morning or later in the day when the sun is not directly shining into the lens, and there are no visible sources of glare or harsh light in the image. The street is well-lit by ambient daylight, and no vehicles in the visible scene have their headlights on at a brightness that would be considered "extremely bright." Additionally, there is no evidence of lens flare or overexposure that would indicate direct sunlight entering the camera lens.
