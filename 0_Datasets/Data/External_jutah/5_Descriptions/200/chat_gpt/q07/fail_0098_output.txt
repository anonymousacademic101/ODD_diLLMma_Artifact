NO

The image shows an urban night scene with various sources of artificial light, but there are no extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight into the camera. The lights in the image seem to be from street lamps, illuminated signs, and vehicles, which do not appear overly bright or blinding to the camera sensor. There is no sunlight, as it's nighttime, and while there are headlights from oncoming traffic, none are shining directly into the camera in a manner that would be considered "extremely bright."
