NO

The image shows a nighttime street scene with various vehicles, and though there are lights from vehicles and streetlights, none appear to be "extremely bright" in the sense of overexposing the image or causing significant lens flare that would indicate headlights shining directly into the camera. There is no evidence of direct sunlight, as it is clearly after sunset based on the image context.
