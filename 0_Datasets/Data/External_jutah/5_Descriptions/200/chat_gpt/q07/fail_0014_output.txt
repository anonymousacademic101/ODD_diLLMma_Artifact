NO.

There is no indication of extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight into the camera. The scene appears evenly lit with natural daylight, and there are no visible glares or overexposure from headlights or the sun that would suggest intense brightness. The shadows on the ground indicate the sun is high in the sky, reducing the likelihood of direct sunlight into the camera lens.
