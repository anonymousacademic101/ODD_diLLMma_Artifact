NO

The lights visible in the image are typical of a well-lit urban street at night. There are no extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight into the camera. The street and traffic lights are emitting normal levels of light that one would expect in such an environment, and there are no intense glares or reflections that would indicate extremely bright lights.
