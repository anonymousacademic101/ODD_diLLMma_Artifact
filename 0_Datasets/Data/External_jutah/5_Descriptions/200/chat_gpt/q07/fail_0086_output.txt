NO

In the image provided, there are no extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight into the camera that might impair visibility. The scene is well-lit, and it's daytime, so headlights are generally not as prominent, and there is no indication of direct sunlight causing glare into the camera lens. The sky is partly cloudy, which also suggests that sunlight isn't directly shining into the camera.
