The image provided is a nighttime cityscape with multiple sources of artificial light, including street lamps and vehicle headlights. However, none of the lights appear to be extremely bright in the context of direct sunlight or intense glare from oncoming traffic that would significantly impair visibility. The lighting seems typical for an urban environment after dark, with no single light source overwhelming the camera's exposure.
