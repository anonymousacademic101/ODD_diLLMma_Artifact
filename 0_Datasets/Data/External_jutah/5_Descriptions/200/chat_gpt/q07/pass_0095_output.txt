The photo shows an urban night scene with various sources of artificial light. While there is an abundance of lights from vehicles, streetlights, and signage, none of the lights appear to be extremely bright or causing significant glare that would suggest oncoming headlights on high beam or direct sunlight. The lighting conditions seem typical for a city environment during the evening.
