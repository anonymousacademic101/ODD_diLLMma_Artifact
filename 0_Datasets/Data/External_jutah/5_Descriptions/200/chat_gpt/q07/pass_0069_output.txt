The image shows a daytime street scene with clear visibility. There are no extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight glaring into the camera. The sky is partly cloudy, and the light is diffused, which prevents any harsh sunlight effects in the photo. The vehicles in view have their headlights off, and none of the light sources in the image appear to be overly bright or causing glare.
