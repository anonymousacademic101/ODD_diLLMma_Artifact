The image shows several light sources, including street lights and vehicle headlights. There are a few headlights from oncoming cars that are relatively bright compared to the surrounding lighting conditions. These lights are not extremely overpowering or fully blinding, but they do stand out as the brightest points in the scene, indicating that they could potentially be considered bright when looking directly at them. Additionally, there is no direct sunlight as the sky is dark, which suggests it is nighttime.
