NO

There are no extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight in the image. The scene appears to be at night, with streetlights and vehicle lights visible, but none are overwhelmingly bright or causing significant glare into the camera's lens. The lighting is relatively normal for a nighttime street scene, and there's no evidence of direct sunlight because it is night.
