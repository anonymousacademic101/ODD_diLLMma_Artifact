NO.

The image presented does not contain any extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights, as there are no vehicles with their headlights on facing the camera. Additionally, there is no direct sunlight casting into the camera lens that would cause lens flare or significant glare; the sunlight appears to be illuminating the scene evenly without harsh reflections or brightness directly into the camera sensor.
