The scene appears to be overcast with no direct sunlight, and although some vehicles have their headlights on due to the low light conditions, there are no extremely bright lights from oncoming traffic or direct sunlight causing glare or reflections that are overpowering the camera's exposure settings. The light from the vehicles' headlights is visible but not excessively bright or blinding.
