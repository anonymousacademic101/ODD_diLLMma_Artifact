NO

There are no extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight into the camera in this image. The setting appears to be during twilight or early evening with artificial lights from street lamps and illuminated buildings, none of which are producing glare or overexposure in the photo. The headlights visible from oncoming traffic are not overly bright and do not cause any significant reflection or lens flare that would indicate extremely bright lights. Additionally, there is no sunlight visible as the sky is dark, suggesting that the photo was taken after sunset.
