There are no extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight into the camera causing glare or overexposure in this image. The lighting appears to be even, and visibility is clear throughout the scene. The sun seems to be high in the sky, casting shadows beneath vehicles and trees, without shining directly into the camera lens.
