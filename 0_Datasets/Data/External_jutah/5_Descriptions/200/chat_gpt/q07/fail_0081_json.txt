There is no indication of direct sunlight since it is night, and the headlights visible in the image appear to be captured without causing excessive brightness, possibly due to the camera settings used for nighttime photography.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
