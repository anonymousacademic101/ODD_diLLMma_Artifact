NO

The image depicts a street scene during the daytime with clear skies, and the lighting appears even and natural. There are no signs of extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights, and direct sunlight is not glaring into the camera lens in a manner that would cause significant overexposure or lens flare. The shadows cast by objects suggest the sun is relatively high in the sky but not in the direct line of sight of the camera.
