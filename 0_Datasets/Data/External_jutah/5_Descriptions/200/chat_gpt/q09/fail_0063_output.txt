From the visual information available in the image, the road appears to be flat. The lines on the road, the orientation of the vehicles, the building facades, and the pedestrians all suggest that the road surface is level and there are no visible inclines or declines that would indicate hills. The urban setting with geometrically aligned architecture also supports the observation of a flat road.
