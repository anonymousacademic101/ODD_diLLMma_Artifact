NO

The road visible in the image appears to be flat rather than hilly. The horizontal lines of the crosswalks, building bases, and vertical structures suggest there are no significant inclines or declines in the immediate vicinity. The image shows a typical urban street crossing with level ground, as evidenced by the straight and even positioning of vehicles, street features, and the elevated train tracks. Hilly roads would likely show variations in the angles of these elements relative to the horizon, which is not present in this image.
