NO.

The road visible in the image appears flat and does not show any signs of being hilly. The photograph provides a clear view of the street and its immediate surroundings, and both the orientation of the vehicles parked on the side of the road and the structures around it do not suggest any significant incline or decline that would indicate a hilly terrain.
