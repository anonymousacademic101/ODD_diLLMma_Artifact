NO

The image provided does not offer any clear indication of the road's topography beyond the immediate vicinity. The section of the road visible in the image appears to be flat, with no visible hills in the immediate foreground or background. However, without a broader view or additional context, it's impossible to conclusively determine whether the entirety of the road is hilly or not just from this specific perspective. The assessment is based solely on the visible section of the road in the image.
