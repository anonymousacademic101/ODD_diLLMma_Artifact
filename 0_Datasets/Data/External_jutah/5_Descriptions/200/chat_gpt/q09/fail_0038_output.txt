NO.

The road in the image appears to be relatively flat, with no significant inclines or declines visible in the section that can be seen. The horizon line remains level, and the road's surface doesn't show any signs of slopes or hills within the field of view of the image. Also, the vehicles on the road are aligned with the flat surface, which supports the observation that the road is not hilly at this point.
