NO

The road in the image appears to be quite level. There is no visible incline or decline that would indicate the road is hilly. The street is lined with buildings that have a consistent relation to the road's height, suggesting a flat urban road surface typical of many cityscapes. The elevation change that characterizes a hilly road is not present in this image.
