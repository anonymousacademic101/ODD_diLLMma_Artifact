NO.

The image shows a scene on an urban road at night with traffic lights and multiple lanes of traffic. The vehicles are positioned in a way that indicates a flat surface rather than a hilly one. There are no visual indications of inclines or slopes that would suggest the road is hilly. The skyline is horizontal, and the buildings are aligned upright, supporting the observation that the road is not hilly.
