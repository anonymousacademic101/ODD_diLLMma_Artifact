The road appears to be hilly because the traffic signs and the alignment of the vehicles in the distance suggest a downward slope leading away from the viewer's perspective. Additionally, the horizon line created by the buildings slightly tilts downward from left to right, indicating the presence of an incline or decline in the roadway.
