NO

Based on the image provided, the road does not appear to be hilly. The road looks relatively flat and straight, and the urban environment with tall buildings suggests it's in a city where streets are typically level. However, without the ability to see more of the road or its surroundings, I cannot provide a definitive assessment of the entire road's topography beyond what is visible in the photo.
