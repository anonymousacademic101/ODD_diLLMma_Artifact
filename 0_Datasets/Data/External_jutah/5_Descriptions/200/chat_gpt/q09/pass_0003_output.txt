NO.

The road displayed in the image is a bridge, not a hilly terrain. The bridge appears to have a gentle incline or decline, but it doesn't display characteristics of a hilly road with multiple elevations and slopes. A hilly road typically features a series of rises and dips, which is not evident here; instead, the bridge provides a relatively level route across a river or other geographical barrier.
