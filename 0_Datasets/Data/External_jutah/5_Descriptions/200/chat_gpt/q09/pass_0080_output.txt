NO.

The road in the image appears to be relatively flat rather than hilly. While there may be slight undulations or changes in elevation not fully visible in the photo, the visible portion of the road does not show any significant inclines or declines that would characterize it as hilly. The traffic flows in a straight path, and the horizon line is level, which are typical indicators of a flat road terrain.
