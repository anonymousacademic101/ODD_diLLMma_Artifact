The road in the image appears to be relatively flat, as indicated by the straight horizontal lines formed by the lane markings and the curb on the side of the road. The buildings and the street lights are also vertical and parallel to each other which typically suggests that the road surface is flat rather than hilly. Additionally, the vehicles on the road do not show any angle that would imply a significant incline or decline.
