NO.

The road shown in the image appears to be flat and not hilly. There are no visible inclines or declines that would indicate the presence of hills. The vehicles and buildings are all aligned in a way that supports the flatness of the street, and the horizontal lines of the architecture follow a straight, level line, rather than contouring to hills or slopes.
