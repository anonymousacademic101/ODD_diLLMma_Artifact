The road in the image appears to be relatively flat rather than hilly. The horizon line is straight, and the vehicles on the road do not show an angle that would indicate a significant incline or decline. The road signs also appear upright and parallel to the trees, suggesting that the road is not subject to significant undulations that characterize hilly terrain.
