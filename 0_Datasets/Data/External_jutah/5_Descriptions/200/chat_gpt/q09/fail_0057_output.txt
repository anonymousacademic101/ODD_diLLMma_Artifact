The road in the image appears to be sloping upwards, indicating a hilly terrain. This is evident from the angle of the vehicles and the street layout, which shows they are ascending. Additionally, the street sign says "Hill St," which often indicates a street on a hill or slope. The background also shows buildings that seem to be built at various elevations, supporting the observation of a hilly road.
