The road appears to be relatively flat based on the image provided. There are no visible inclines or declines to indicate that it is hilly. The vehicles on the road are all oriented on a level plane, and the buildings on either side of the street maintain a consistent baseline without any signs of sloping that would suggest the presence of hills.
