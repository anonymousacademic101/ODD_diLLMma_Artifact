Based on the image provided, the road appears relatively flat. The rows of vehicles on the road also suggest a flat surface, as there are no visible angles that would suggest an incline or decline indicative of a hilly road. Additionally, the lines on the crosswalk are straight and parallel to the buildings, which typically would not be the case if there was a significant hill.
