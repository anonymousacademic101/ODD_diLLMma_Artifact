The road seen in the image appears to be relatively flat and is not displaying hills. It is running under an overpass, which also seems to be level without any visible inclines, suggesting that the area is not hilly. Moreover, the parked cars and surroundings do not indicate any significant slope that would characterize a hilly road.
