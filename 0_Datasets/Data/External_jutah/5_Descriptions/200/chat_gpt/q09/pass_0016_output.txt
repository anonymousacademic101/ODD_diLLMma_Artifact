The road depicted in the image shows a slight downward inclination, indicating that there is a slope. Even though the slope might not be significant at the exact point where the picture is taken, the terrain around the road is noticeably uneven, with a hill visible on the left side. The context suggests a hilly environment, and thus the road can be considered part of a hilly area.
