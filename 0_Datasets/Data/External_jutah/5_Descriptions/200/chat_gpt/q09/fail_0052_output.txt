NO.

The road in the image appears to be flat. There are no visible inclines or declines that would suggest it's hilly. The surrounding environment, including the buildings and the plaza with a monument, also indicates that this is an urban setting without significant variations in elevation, at least within the immediate vicinity captured in the photo.
