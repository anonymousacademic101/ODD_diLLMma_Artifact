The road visible in the image appears to be flat rather than hilly. The street lines and infrastructure such as traffic lights and buildings are parallel to the horizontal line of the image, which supports the observation that the road surface is level in this specific area. Hilly roads typically show a visible incline or decline in their road surface, which is not present in this image.
