NO.

The road displayed in the image appears to be relatively level in the immediate foreground and doesn't show any significant changes in elevation that would be characterized as hilly. The perspective of the photograph shows a highway that is flat or has a gentle gradient at most. It's possible there are inclines or declines further along, but from this vantage point, it cannot be concluded that the road is hilly.
