The road in the image appears to be flat and level without any visible inclines or declines that would indicate it is hilly. The horizontal lines of the road, sidewalks, and background environment support the perception of a flat terrain. Additionally, the presence of palm trees and the style of the buildings suggest a coastal or tropical area, which are often flat. Hilly terrains typically exhibit more varied elevation changes within a short distance, which are not observed in this image.
