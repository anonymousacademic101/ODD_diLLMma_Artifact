The road does not run horizontally across the image. The view suggests we are looking directly at a section of road intersecting with another, with crosswalks that are typically found at intersections. The road we are "driving" on is heading toward the intersection and then continues beyond it, perpendicular to the bottom edge of the image, rather than horizontally across the image.
