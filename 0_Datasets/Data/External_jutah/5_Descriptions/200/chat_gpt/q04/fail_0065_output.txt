The road runs horizontally across the image. This is evident from the positioning of the pedestrian crossing stripes, which provide a clear visual cue that the road spans from left to right across the frame. Additionally, the orientation of the traffic lights and the stop line painted on the road indicate a horizontal roadway with respect to the image's perspective.
