YES

The road that we are on appears to run horizontally across the image. The orientation of the parked cars on the left-hand side, the pedestrian crosswalk patterns on the road, and the positioning of traffic signals and road markings suggest that the perspective of the image is such that the road extends horizontally from left to right across the frame, and we are facing an intersection that allows for crossing or turning onto another road.
