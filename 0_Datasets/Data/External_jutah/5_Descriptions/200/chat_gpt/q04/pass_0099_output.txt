NO.

The road in the image does not show a traditional intersection where two or more roads cross or meet at a junction. Instead, the road runs horizontally across the image, as evidenced by the flow of traffic in parallel lanes and the perspective of the road leading towards the horizon. The continuous lanes of traffic without any visible cross traffic indicate that it is a section of a highway or main road, rather than an intersection.
