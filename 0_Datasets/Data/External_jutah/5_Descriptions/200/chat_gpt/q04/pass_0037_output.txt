YES

The road runs horizontally across the image from the perspective of the photo. It's clear from the image that we're looking down a straight road rather than an intersection where roads would be crossing each other. Traffic signals and road markings also indicate forward movement along the road, supporting the horizontal orientation of the road in the image.
