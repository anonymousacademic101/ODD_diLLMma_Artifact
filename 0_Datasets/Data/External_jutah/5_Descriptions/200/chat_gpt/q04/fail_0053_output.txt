NO

The road we are observing does not run horizontally across the image. The perspective of the image suggests that the road extends into the distance rather than across the picture. The blue pickup truck is facing towards the camera, providing a clue that traffic flows towards and away from the viewpoint rather than left to right. Additionally, the alignment of the "NO PARKING" sign and the entrance to the parking lot also support the conclusion that the road is not running horizontally across the image.
