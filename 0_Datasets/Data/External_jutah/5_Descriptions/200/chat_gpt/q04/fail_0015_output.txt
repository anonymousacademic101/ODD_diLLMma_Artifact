YES

The road appears to be at an intersection. This assumption is based on visual cues such as the traffic lights positioned for multiple directions, the crosswalks indicating pedestrian paths across different segments of roadway, and the "ROAD CLOSED" sign which suggests that one of the crossing roads is not currently in use. Additionally, the vehicles are oriented in a manner that typically indicates the presence of an intersection where roads meet or cross each other.
