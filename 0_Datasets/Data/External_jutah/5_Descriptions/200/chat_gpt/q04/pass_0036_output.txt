NO

The road does not run horizontally across the image, instead, the road we are driving on approaches an intersection and continues forward. The traffic lights and signs are positioned for traffic moving towards and away from the viewpoint of the image, indicating that it is primarily a straight road intersected by another. The orientation of the cars, pedestrian crosswalk lines, and road markings all support this observation.
