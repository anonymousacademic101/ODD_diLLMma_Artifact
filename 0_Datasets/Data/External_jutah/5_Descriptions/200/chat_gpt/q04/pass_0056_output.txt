The road runs horizontally across the image. An intersection typically involves two or more roads that cross each other at some angle, and traffic can usually flow in more than one direction at an intersection. In the provided image, we can see the road extending from the foreground to the background, indicating a straight path rather than an intersection where multiple roads meet or cross.
