The road appears to run horizontally across the image based on the orientation of the vehicles, the traffic signal, and the layout of the crosswalks. The cars are positioned in a way that suggests they are waiting for the traffic light to change, which would allow them to proceed across the intersection or turn into another road, indicating that the road they are on runs horizontally in the context of the photo.
