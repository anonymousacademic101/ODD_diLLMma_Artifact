NO.

The road in the image appears to be a multi-lane highway or expressway, running horizontally across the frame of the image. There is no clear indication of an intersection within the visible area. The lanes of traffic move parallel to each other, and there is a concrete barrier separating the directions of travel, which is typical for this kind of road and suggests it is not an intersection.
