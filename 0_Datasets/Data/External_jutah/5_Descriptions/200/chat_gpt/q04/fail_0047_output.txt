NO.

The image does not show a road that we are driving on; it shows a parking lot with parked cars and no clear signs of a road intended for driving across the image horizontally. There are no road markings that indicate lanes for driving across the field of view; instead, there are parking lot lines that indicate spaces for vehicles to park. Additionally, the perspective of the image is such that a road running horizontally would typically have consistent width, which is not observed here. The visual cues point to a stationary observer in a parking area rather than a road for driving.
