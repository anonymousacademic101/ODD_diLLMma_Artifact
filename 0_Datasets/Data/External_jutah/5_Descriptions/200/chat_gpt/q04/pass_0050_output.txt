YES.

The road runs horizontally across the image. This can be deduced from the orientation of the vehicles which are aligned parallel to the bottom edge of the photo, indicating that the road on which they are traveling extends left to right from the perspective of the camera. The presence of traffic lights facing the traffic further confirms that the road is meant for horizontal travel across the image.
