YES

The road we are driving on runs horizontally across the image. The orientation of the parked cars, the crosswalk, and the traffic signal suggest that the roadway extends from left to right across the scene. The additional street that intersects it can be seen ahead, indicating that this is also an intersection. However, your question primarily asks about the direction of the road we are on, which is horizontal in the image provided.
