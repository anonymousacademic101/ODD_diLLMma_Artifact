YES

The road runs horizontally across the image. This is evident because the vehicles are oriented left to right in the picture, aligned with the direction of the road, and the streetscape elements like traffic lights, buildings, and parked cars also follow this horizontal alignment. The perspective of the photo indicates that we're looking down the length of the road rather than across it at an intersection.
