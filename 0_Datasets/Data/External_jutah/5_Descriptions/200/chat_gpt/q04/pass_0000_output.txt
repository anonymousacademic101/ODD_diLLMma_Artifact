The road does not run horizontally across the image; rather, it seems to be a part of an intersection where we are looking at the crossing road head-on. The orientation of the vehicles on the road, the presence of traffic lights, lane markings, and the placement of orange traffic cones suggest traffic control typical for an intersection rather than a straight horizontal road.
