YES

The road runs horizontally across the image. This can be determined by the orientation of the cars, road markings, traffic lights, and street signage, which are arranged to facilitate traffic in a direction that is left to right or right to left in the image perspective, indicating a horizontal flow of the road. The traffic lights are facing the direction that would control traffic moving across the image, not towards or away from the viewpoint. Additionally, there is a visible crosswalk perpendicular to this flow, indicating the presence of an intersection where another road would cross the one we are on.
