There is a traffic light with a green signal and a dedicated right-turn arrow, which typically controls traffic at intersections. Additionally, indications like road markings, pedestrian crossing signage, and the placement of street lights and road barriers suggest that multiple roads converge at this point, consistent with an intersection. The angle at which the photo was taken and the framing of the buildings on both sides also suggest that this is an intersection rather than a straight horizontal road.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
