The road runs horizontally across the image. We can infer this because the traffic lights are facing towards and away from our perspective, indicating the traffic flow intended for the road we are on. Additionally, the crosswalks are perpendicular to the direction we are facing, which further suggests that the road runs left to right across the image.
