YES

The road appears to run horizontally across the image. Traffic lights are usually oriented to face the direction of traffic flow at an intersection, which helps to indicate the alignment of the road. In this image, the lights are clearly visible, spanning horizontally across the photo, suggesting that they are oriented for traffic moving parallel to the bottom edge of the image. Additionally, the visible lane markings, the positions of the vehicles, and the crosswalk lines also run horizontally from the perspective of the image, further indicating that the road we are "driving on" is aligned horizontally across the frame.
