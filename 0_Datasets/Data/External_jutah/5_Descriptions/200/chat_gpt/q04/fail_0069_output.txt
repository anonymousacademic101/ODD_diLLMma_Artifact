The image depicts a scene which is not oriented in the traditional manner of a road running either horizontally or vertically. Instead, the road seems to run into the image with a slight diagonal orientation from the lower right corner towards the upper left, suggesting that we are looking at a three-dimensional perspective, and the road may be part of an intersection or branching off. The alignment of cars parked on both sides of the street implies that the road continues beyond the frame of the image. The orientation isn't strictly horizontal across the image.
