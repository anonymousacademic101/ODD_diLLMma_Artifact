The road we are viewing runs horizontally across the image. This is evident from the visible lane markings and crosswalks, which delineate the intersection, and the placement of the traffic lights, which control the flow of traffic across the horizontal path. The vehicles are also positioned in a manner that is consistent with driving on a road running horizontally across the frame.
