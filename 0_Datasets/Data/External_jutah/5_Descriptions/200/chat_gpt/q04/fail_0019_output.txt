YES

The road on which we (the viewpoint of the image) are seemingly traveling is at an intersection with another road that runs horizontally across the image. This can be determined by observing the presence of traffic lights facing multiple directions, crosswalk markings, and lanes that indicate the intersection of two roads. The horizontal road can be seen to the left and right of the image, intersected by the road we are on, which enters the intersection from the bottom of the image. Additionally, the placement of the railroad crossing signals also indicates the intersection of roads with a railroad track that appears to run parallel to the horizontal road.
