YES

The road runs horizontally across the image. Based on the perspective of the photograph, we can see the painted roadway markings stretching horizontally from the left side to the right side of the image, indicating the direction of traffic flow along the road. There are also vehicles aligned in this horizontal manner, supporting the observation that the road runs horizontally across the picture rather than being an intersection.
