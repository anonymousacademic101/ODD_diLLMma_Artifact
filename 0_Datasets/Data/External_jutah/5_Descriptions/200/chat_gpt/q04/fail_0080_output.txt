YES

The road runs horizontally across the image. You can tell because the lanes, road markings, and the direction of vehicles' movement indicate a path that is broadly left-to-right across the frame of the photo rather than towards or away from the viewpoint. The presence of traffic signals facing sideways towards the camera also supports this orientation.
