YES

The road runs horizontally across the image. This can be inferred because the cars are positioned parallel to the bottom edge of the picture, indicating that the direction of traffic is from left to right or right to left, hence the road runs horizontally in the context of the image. The presence of a crosswalk perpendicular to the cars and parallel to the monument also supports this view.
