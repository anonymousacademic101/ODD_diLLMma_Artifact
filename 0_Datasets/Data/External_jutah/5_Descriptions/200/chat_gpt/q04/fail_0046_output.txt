NO.

The road does not appear to be an intersection, nor does it run horizontally across the image. Based on the visible tire marks and the orientation of the parked trucks, it seems the road or parking lot is laid out in a manner allowing vehicles to drive towards the lighthouse and parallel to the water's edge, suggesting a vertical disposition relative to the bottom edge of the photograph.
