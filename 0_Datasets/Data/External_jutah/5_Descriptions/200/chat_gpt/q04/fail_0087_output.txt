YES

The road runs horizontally across the image. This is evident from the orientation of the traffic lights, pedestrian crossings, and vehicles which are all aligned in a manner consistent with a street that runs perpendicular to the viewpoint of the image. The street appears to have sidewalks on either side which further indicates its horizontal orientation across the frame.
