YES

The road appears to be an intersection. This can be determined because there is a street sign at the corner of the buildings that reads "COAST ST," indicating the name of a different street from the one we are on, which is consistent with intersecting streets. Additionally, the arrangement of the buildings, the crosswalk lines on the road, and the positioning of the vehicles suggest that this is an intersection where one road meets another.
