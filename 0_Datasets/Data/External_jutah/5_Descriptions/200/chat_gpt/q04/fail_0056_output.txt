YES

The road we are driving on is an intersection. The STOP sign and the painted arrows on the road indicate that it is an approach to an intersection where drivers must stop and yield to traffic before proceeding. Additionally, there are other lanes visible that run horizontally across the image, which is characteristic of an intersection where two or more roads cross each other.
