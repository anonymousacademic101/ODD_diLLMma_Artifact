YES

The road we are driving on is part of an intersection. This can be understood by the presence of traffic signals facing multiple directions, signage indicating crossing streets, and vehicles positioned in a manner that indicates they are on a different road crossing the path of the camera's perspective. The crossing of the vehicles and the layout of the traffic lights all suggest an intersection scenario rather than a straight horizontal road.
