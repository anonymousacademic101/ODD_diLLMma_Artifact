The road runs horizontally across the image from the perspective of the viewer. The road appears to be running from the left to the right side of the image, and the vehicles are positioned in lanes that align with this horizontal orientation. The photo looks to be taken from the driver's perspective within a vehicle that is part of a queue, indicating the road's direction of travel is perpendicular to the length of the image.
