YES

The road appears to run horizontally across the image. You can tell because of the perspective lines of the road and the angle of the vehicles parked on the side of the road seen to the left, which suggest that the road extends from left to right rather than towards the vanishing point in the image. Also, the "no parking" sign facing us indicates that traffic on this road would move parallel to the plane of the image.
