YES

The road we are driving on appears to be a part of an intersection, as indicated by the presence of traffic signals, road markings for lanes and crosswalks, and the entrance to what appears to be a parking structure on the right. There are vehicles positioned as if they are waiting at a traffic signal, suggesting that it's an area where roads intersect and traffic is controlled with signals.
