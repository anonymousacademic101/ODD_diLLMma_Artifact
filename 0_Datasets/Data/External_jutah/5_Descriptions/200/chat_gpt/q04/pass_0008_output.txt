YES

The road we are driving on runs horizontally across the image. This can be inferred from the orientation of the vehicles, the positioning of the traffic lights, and the layout of the lane markings, all of which suggest a horizontal roadway across the frame. The vehicles are positioned side-by-side, facing forward, indicating that the road extends from left to right across the image.
