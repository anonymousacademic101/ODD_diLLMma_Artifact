While the photo does not afford a full aerial view to discern the layout of the road, the visible lane markings, alignment of the vehicles, and the structure of the tunnel suggest that the road runs longitudinally from one end of the tunnel to the otherâ€”effectively implying a horizontal orientation in relation to the image frame. There is no evidence in the image of an intersection, where roads would cross each other or branch off.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
