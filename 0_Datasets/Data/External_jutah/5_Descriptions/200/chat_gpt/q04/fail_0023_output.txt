YES

The road runs horizontally across the image. This can be determined by the orientation of the parked cars on the right side of the road, the traffic lights ahead which are aligned to stop vehicles moving in a horizontal direction, and the lanes on the road that also run parallel to the bottom edge of the image, indicating a horizontal path. Additionally, the perspective of the buildings on both sides of the road conforms to a view looking straight down a road rather than at an intersection.
