Given the framing of the image, it is evident that the road runs in a horizontal direction from the left to the right side of the image. An intersection would typically imply the crossing of two or more roads. However, the image provided does not visibly show an intersecting road in the frame. There's only one visible road with a clear horizontal orientation."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
