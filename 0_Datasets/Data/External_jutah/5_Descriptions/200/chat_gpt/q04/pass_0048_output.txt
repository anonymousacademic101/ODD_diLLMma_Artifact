The road runs horizontally across the image, and we are looking at an intersection. This can be determined because there are traffic signals facing multiple directions, indicating that traffic flow is controlled for vehicles traveling on different roads that intersect here. Additionally, the crosswalk patterns and signage support the presence of an intersection.
