YES

The road runs horizontally across the image as we can observe multiple lanes of traffic flowing side by side from the foreground to the background, which is characteristic of roads that extend horizontally through a photograph. The vehicles are aligned parallel to the bottom edge of the image, indicating that the road stretches horizontally in the captured view. Further reinforcing this perspective are the street intersections visible in the distance, with cross traffic and associated traffic signals perpendicular to the direction we are facing.
