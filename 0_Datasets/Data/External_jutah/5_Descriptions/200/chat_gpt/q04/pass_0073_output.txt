YES

The road runs horizontally across the image. It can be determined by the orientation of the vehicles, which are parallel to the bottom edge of the photo, indicating that the road on which they are driving extends from one side of the image to the other in a horizontal fashion. An intersection would typically show roads converging at an angle, or vehicles facing perpendicular directions, which is not evident here.
