YES.

The road we are driving on is an intersection. This can be determined because there are traffic signals facing multiple directions, indicating the presence of crossing roads. Additionally, there is a street sign reading "NE 8 ST," which typically denotes a street intersecting the one we are on, further suggesting that this is an intersection. The lanes and traffic signals are aligned in a way that controls traffic flow from multiple directions, which is characteristic of an intersection.
