YES

The road runs horizontally across the image. There is traffic visible in lanes moving in both directions, and the organization of the vehicles suggests a typical straight section of road rather than an intersection. The street lights and traffic signals are aligned with the road's horizontal direction, which further indicates that the road is not an intersection in this portion of the image.
