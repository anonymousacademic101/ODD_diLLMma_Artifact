YES

The road runs horizontally across the image because the SUV is oriented left-to-right in the frame, indicating that the direction of traffic is perpendicular to the vertical edges of the photo. The perspective of the road, as well as the position of the vehicles and road markings, supports this orientation. Additionally, there are no visible signs of an intersection, such as traffic lights or intersecting traffic lanes, within the visible portion of the image.
