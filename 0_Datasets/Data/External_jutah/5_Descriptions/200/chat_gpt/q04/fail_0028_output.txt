YES

The road we are driving on is an intersection. This can be determined by the presence of traffic signals facing multiple directions, pedestrian crosswalks that indicate the crossing of another road, and the visible street corner on the right-hand side where there's a building (Americana Submarine) situated at an angle, suggesting the corner of two intersecting streets. Additionally, the arrangement of the vehicles and visible lane markings are consistent with an intersection where roads meet or cross each other.
