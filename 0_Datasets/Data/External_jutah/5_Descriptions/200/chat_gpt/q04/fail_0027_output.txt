YES

The road we are driving on runs horizontally across the image. This can be inferred as the photo shows a roadway extending from the left to the right side of the frame, with a set of traffic lights displaying green signals for traffic moving in the horizontal direction, suggesting that the view is of a section of the road that is moving straight ahead from the camera's perspective. Additionally, there are vehicles such as the bus oriented parallel to the road's horizontal axis, further indicating that the road runs horizontally across the image.
