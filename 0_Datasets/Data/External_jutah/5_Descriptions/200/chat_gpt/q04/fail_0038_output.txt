The road does not run horizontally across the image. The photo shows a road that is running vertically from the perspective of the image, with the direction of travel being either into or out of the picture rather than from side to side. This can be determined by the orientation of the vehicles, which appear to be moving toward the viewpoint of the camera or away from it, as well as by the clear demarcation of the lanes and road markings which align with the vertical perspective.
