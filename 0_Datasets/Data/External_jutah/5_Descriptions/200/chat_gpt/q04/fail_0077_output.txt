The road runs horizontally across the image. This can be determined because the vehicles are parked parallel to the building on the side of the road, indicating that the road is oriented in a horizontal direction with respect to the point of view of the image. Additionally, the crosswalk and the "DO NOT ENTER" signs are perpendicular to this orientation, which aligns with a typical horizontal road layout.
