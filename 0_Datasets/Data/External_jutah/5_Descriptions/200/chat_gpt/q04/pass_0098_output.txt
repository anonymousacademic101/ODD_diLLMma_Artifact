NO

The road in the image runs horizontally across it. The lanes of traffic are parallel to the bottom edge of the image, indicating the horizontal direction of the road. An intersection would typically imply a place where two or more roads cross each other, and in this image, there are no visible roads crossing the one we are driving on; instead, there's a continuous flow of traffic moving in the same direction, which suggests it is not an intersection.
