YES

The road we are driving on runs horizontally across the image. This can be determined by the orientation of the vehicles parked along the side of the street and the lane markings that show traffic moving parallel to the bottom edge of the image, indicating a horizontal direction. Additionally, the buses on the right-hand side are aligned in a way that suggests they are moving along the same horizontal path, reinforcing this observation.
