NO.

The road in the image does not depict an intersection and is not directly running horizontally across the image. Instead, the road curves gently to the right and follows the natural terrain of the landscape along the sea coast. The road appears to be a coastal highway, as it is situated along the sea, and no intersecting roads or cross traffic are visible in the image. The perspective in which the photo was taken makes the road extend into the distance diagonally from the bottom left towards the center right of the image.
