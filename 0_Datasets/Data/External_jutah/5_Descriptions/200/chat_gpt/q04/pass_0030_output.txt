NO

The image shows a stretch of road that runs vertically from the bottom to the top of the image based on the conventional orientation of the photo. The cars are aligned in a way that suggests the road continues straight ahead rather than running horizontally across the image. There is no clear intersection within the immediate field of view where one can say the road intersects horizontally across the image. An intersection would involve another road crossing this one, which is not visible here; rather, the road extends towards the horizon with traffic organized in lanes heading in the same general direction, denoting a typical city street rather than a crossroad.
