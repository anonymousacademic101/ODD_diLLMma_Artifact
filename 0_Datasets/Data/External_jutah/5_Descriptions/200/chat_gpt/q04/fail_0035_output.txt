YES

The road runs horizontally across the image. The orientation of the parked cars and their position relative to the curb indicates the direction of traffic flow, which is parallel to the bottom edge of the image. This establishes the road's horizontal orientation in the photo. There is also no indication of an intersection in the immediate view, as we can see the road continuing on both the left and right sides without any crossing traffic lanes.
