This is because we can observe multiple lanes of traffic with vehicles stopped at a traffic signal, indicating that this is an intersection where the road we are on intersects with another road that runs perpendicular to it. Additionally, the presence of traffic signals, crosswalk lines, and signage typical of intersections supports this observation.
