The road runs horizontally across the image. The vehicles in the image are aligned in a manner that indicates a straight path of travel, and there are visible pedestrian crosswalk lines that run perpendicular to the vehicles' direction, which is typical for a horizontal roadway system in the context of the image provided. Additionally, there is a visible traffic signal directly ahead of the vehicles, which suggests a controlled intersection where the main road continues horizontally.
