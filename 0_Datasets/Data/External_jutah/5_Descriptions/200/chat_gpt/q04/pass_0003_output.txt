YES

The road runs horizontally across the image. From the perspective shown, it's clear that the road extends from the bottom towards the horizon in a straight path defined by the bridge structure surrounding it. There are no visible intersections or other roads crossing its path within the frame of the image. The bridge's linear design and the parallel lines on the road surface guide the eye from the front to the back of the image, reinforcing the horizontal direction.
