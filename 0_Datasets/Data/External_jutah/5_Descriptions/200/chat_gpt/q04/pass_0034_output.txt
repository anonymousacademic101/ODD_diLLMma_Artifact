YES

The road runs horizontally across the image from the perspective of the camera. You can see the lane markings that suggest it is a multi-lane road extending from the lower portion of the image towards the horizon. The presence of traffic lights and vehicles arranged perpendicularly to the direction of the truck on the left side of the image further indicates that there is an intersection where this road intersects with another.
