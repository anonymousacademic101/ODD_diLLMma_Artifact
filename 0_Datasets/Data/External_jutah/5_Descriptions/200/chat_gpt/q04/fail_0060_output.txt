YES

The road you are driving on is an intersection. This is evident from the pedestrian crosswalks, traffic signals facing multiple directions, and visible corner of a sidewalk indicating the crossing of two roads. Additionally, the presence of cars on the perpendicular road stopped by a red light further confirms this is an intersection.
