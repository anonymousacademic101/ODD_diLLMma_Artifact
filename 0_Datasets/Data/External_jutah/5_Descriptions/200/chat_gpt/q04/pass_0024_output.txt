NO

The road we are driving on appears to be a typical two-way street rather than an intersection. It is depicted as running vertically in relation to the perspective of the image from bottom to top, not horizontally across the image. There are vehicles parked and driving in both directions along the road, with no visible cross traffic that would indicate an intersection.
