YES

The road shown in the image is an intersection. This can be identified by the presence of traffic lights facing multiple directions, marked pedestrian crossings, and vehicles positioning themselves in lanes that indicate the possibility of turning left or right as well as going straight across. The roads intersect at a right angle, creating a typical street intersection scenario.
