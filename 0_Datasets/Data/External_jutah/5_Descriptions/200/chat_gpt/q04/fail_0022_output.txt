YES

The road we are driving on runs horizontally across the image. This can be determined by the orientation of the traffic signals, which are facing the viewer, indicating that the direction of traffic they control is perpendicular to the viewer's perspective. The vehicle in the image is also aligned parallel with the bottom edge of the photo, providing further evidence that the road runs horizontally in the context of the image.
