YES

The road shown in the image does indeed run horizontally across the image. You can tell because the traffic signals and lane markings indicate traffic control for a road that traverses from left to right across the view of the image. The crosswalks and pedestrian signals also suggest an intersection, where one road intersects with another that would be coming in from the bottom of the image frame.
