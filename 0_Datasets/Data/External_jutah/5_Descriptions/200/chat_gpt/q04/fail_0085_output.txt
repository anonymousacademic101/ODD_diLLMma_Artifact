YES

The road visible in the image does indeed run horizontally across the image, and you can tell because the traffic is flowing from the left to the right side of the frame. This is further indicated by the crosswalk, traffic signals, and road markings supporting a horizontal perspective in relation to the image. Additionally, there is no visible indication that the road in the immediate foreground is part of an intersection where another road crosses it.
