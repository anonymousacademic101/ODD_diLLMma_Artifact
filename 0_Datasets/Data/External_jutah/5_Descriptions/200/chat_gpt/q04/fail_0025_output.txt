YES

The road runs horizontally across the image. This can be determined because the crosswalks lead across the road directly in front of the viewpoint, implying a typical street crossing. Moreover, there are traffic signals and signage suggesting a perpendicular intersection with another street not visible in the image. The arrangement and orientation of these elements indicate that we are looking at a road at an intersection rather than along the length of the road.
