YES

The road runs horizontally across the image. This can be determined by the orientation of the cars, which are positioned parallel to the bottom edge of the image, and the pedestrian crosswalk lines, which are also aligned horizontally in the image. Additionally, street signs and traffic lights are aligned to face drivers coming from the sides of the image, indicating that the road we are driving on intersects with the road that runs vertically in the image, thus creating an intersection.
