YES

Based on the image, it appears that we are at an intersection. There are multiple traffic signals visible, and their red color indicates that the vehicles in our direction are required to stop. The presence of a crosswalk and a perpendicular road to the left also suggests that this is an intersection where roads meet or cross.
