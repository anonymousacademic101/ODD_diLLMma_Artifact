YES

The road we are driving on runs horizontally across the image. This can be determined by the perspective of the road as it extends from the bottom to the top of the image, revealing that we are viewing the road in a left-to-right or right-to-left perspective rather than looking down an intersecting road. Additionally, there are no visible cross-traffic lanes in immediate proximity that would indicate an intersection, although we can see traffic lights ahead suggesting an intersection further down the road.
