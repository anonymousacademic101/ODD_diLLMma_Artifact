YES.

The road runs horizontally across the image. This can be determined by observing the orientation of the cars, which are aligned in a horizontal fashion relative to the image's frame. They are all positioned parallel to each other, indicating that the road on which they are driving runs left to right across the photo rather than intersecting it from top to bottom.
