YES

The road runs horizontally across the image. This is evident because the vehicles are arranged in rows that extend from the foreground to the background, parallel to the bottom edge of the image. Additionally, the traffic lights ahead are red, indicating the vehicles on this side of the intersection are stopped, which reinforces that the perspective of the image is along the road that we are driving on, not across an intersection.
