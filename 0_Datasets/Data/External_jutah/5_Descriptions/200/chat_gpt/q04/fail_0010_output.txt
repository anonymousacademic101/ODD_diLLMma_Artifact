YES

The road runs horizontally across the image. There are no visible indications of an intersection within the frame of this image, such as traffic lights, side roads, or road markings that typically denote intersections. Instead, the road appears as a straight path from one side of the image to the other, with lanes marked for traffic moving in parallel. The context of the surroundings also suggests a continuous route rather than an intersection.
