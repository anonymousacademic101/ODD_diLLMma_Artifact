YES

The road depicted in the image runs horizontally across the frame. This is evident by observing the orientation of the parked and stopped vehicles, the direction of the traffic lights, and the general layout of the road markings and signs. The road appears to be traveling from the left to the right of the image. There are also clear indications of an intersection where another road intersects perpendicularly, creating a crossroad under an overpass.
