YES

The road we are driving on is at an intersection. This can be determined by the presence of traffic signals facing multiple directions, road markings for pedestrian crossings indicating the meeting of two or more ways, and the visible corner of the buildings indicating the street corners. The image shows the road running both horizontally across the image and continuing beyond the intersection.
