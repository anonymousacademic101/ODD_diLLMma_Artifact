This can be ascertained by the orientation of the parked vehicles on the side of the road and the positioning of the traffic lights, which signal traffic moving in a direction that is perpendicular to the vantage point of the image. Additionally, the painted road markings and crosswalks indicate that the view is across the width of the roadway, which further suggests a horizontal orientation relative to the image frame.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
