YES.

The road runs horizontally across the image. This can be established by the orientation of the vehicles, which are aligned parallel to the bottom edge of the photo, indicating that the road they are on is horizontal in the perspective of the image. Additionally, the crosswalk lines, traffic signals, and lane markings support the presence of an intersection, with the horizontal road being the one we're "driving" on in the view of the image.
