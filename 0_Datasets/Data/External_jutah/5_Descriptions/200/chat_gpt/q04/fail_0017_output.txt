NO

The road is not running horizontally across the image; instead, it appears we are positioned on it, and the road extends away from the camera's perspective. The parked cars are aligned along the sides of the road, indicating that the road runs vertically from the bottom to the top of the image as we are facing down the street. There is no visible evidence that we are at an intersection, as we only see a continuous stretch of road with no cross streets in view.
