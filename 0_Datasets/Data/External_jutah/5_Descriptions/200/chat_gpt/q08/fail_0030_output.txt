The road in the image appears to be a broad urban street with multiple lanes, not narrow. It includes what seems to be a gentle curve at the intersection shown but does not have the characteristics of a winding road that would typically be associated with continuous or sharply curving bends. Instead, the road layout suggests a standard urban grid with controlled intersections, typical of city streets.
