It doesn't look particularly narrow as there seems to be ample space for vehicles in each direction, and there are no visible sharp bends or curves that would typically define a winding road. The traffic is organized with clear lane markings, and there is a designated bike lane as well, suggesting it is a well-structured urban road."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
