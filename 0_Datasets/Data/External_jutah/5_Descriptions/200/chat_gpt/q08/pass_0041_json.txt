There appear to be at least two lanes in each direction, and it does not show any immediate signs of winding paths. There is a visible lane marking dividing the lanes, and vehicles are parked on the side, which further indicates the width of the road. The term "narrow and winding" typically describes roads that have a limited width and a series of turns and curves, which does not apply to the road depicted in the image.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
