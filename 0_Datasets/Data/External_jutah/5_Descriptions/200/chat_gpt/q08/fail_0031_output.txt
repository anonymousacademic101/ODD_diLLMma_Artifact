NO.

The road in the image does not appear to be narrow and winding. It looks like a typical multi-lane urban street with clearly marked lanes, and it is relatively straight in the visible section. There's no evidence in the image of sharp turns or significant bends that would characterize a winding road. Moreover, the presence of multiple lanes suggests it is not particularly narrow.
