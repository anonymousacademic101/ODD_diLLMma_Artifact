NO.

The road in the image is a multi-lane, urban street with distinct lanes for traffic, marked by standard road surface markings. The road appears to be relatively straight within the visible section, with no evident tight turns or bends that would characterize it as winding. Furthermore, the width of the lanes and the presence of multiple lanes in both directions suggest that the road is not narrow. The presence of traffic lights, pedestrian crossings, and buildings lining the street also indicates this is a structured, urban environment, not typically associated with narrow and winding roads.
