NO.

The road depicted in the image appears to be a multi-lane road, with visible lane markings dividing it into at least two lanes in the direction we are viewing. The road also seems to have a straight stretch visible in the photograph, without any immediate sharp turns or bends that would categorize it as winding. Thus, based on this section of the road, it does not appear to be narrow or winding.
