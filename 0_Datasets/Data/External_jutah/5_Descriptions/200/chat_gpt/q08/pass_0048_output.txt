The road in the image is a straight, urban street with multiple lanes clearly marked for traffic, and it is equipped with traffic signals. It is not narrow or winding; instead, it looks wide enough to accommodate several vehicles side by side and shows no signs of curves or bends that would indicate it is winding.
