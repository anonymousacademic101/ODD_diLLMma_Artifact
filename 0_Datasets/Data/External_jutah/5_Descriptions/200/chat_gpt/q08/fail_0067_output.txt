NO.

The road shown in the image appears to be a straight, urban street rather than a narrow and winding road. It is typical of city roads with buildings on either side, a flat surface, and clear lane demarcations. There are no visible curves or bends that would characterize it as "winding," and it seems wide enough to allow for easy vehicle passage, so it does not fit the description of being "narrow" in the context of typical narrow, winding roads.
