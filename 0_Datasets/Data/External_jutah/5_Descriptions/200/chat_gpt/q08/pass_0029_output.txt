NO.

The road in the image is not narrow and winding; it appears to be a wide, multi-lane urban street with straight segments. It is surrounded by tall buildings, typical of urban downtown areas, and the traffic lanes are clearly defined and appear to accommodate a fair amount of vehicular flow, as evidenced by the multiple lanes and spacing between vehicles. There are no visible tight curves that would indicate the road is winding.
