NO.

The road visible in the image is not narrow and winding. It appears to be a straight urban street with multiple lanes, and while there are construction barriers reducing the available width for vehicles, it is not characteristic of what would normally be described as a "narrow and winding" road, which typically refers to smaller rural or mountainous paths with curves. In contrast, this is an urban road with a straight path ahead.
