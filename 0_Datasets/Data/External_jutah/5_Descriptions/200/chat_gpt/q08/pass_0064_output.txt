NO

The image shows vehicles inside a tunnel, and tunnels generally provide straight passages. There are no visible sharp turns or characteristics of a narrow road visible in the image; instead, the lanes appear to be of standard width and accommodate multiple vehicles side by side, which indicates that it's not a narrow road in this section. Winding roads are typically characterized by a series of turns or curves, and this is not evident in the photo provided.
