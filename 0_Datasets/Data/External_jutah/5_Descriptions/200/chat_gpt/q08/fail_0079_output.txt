The road in the image appears to be relatively wide and well-marked for traffic, with multiple lanes and pedestrian crossings, and there is no indication in the visible portion of the image that the road is winding. The environment looks like a developed urban area with clear lane markings and traffic signs, which suggests a standard, straight road layout rather than a narrow and winding one.
