The road in the image appears to be fairly straight and wide. It does not show any signs of winding curves or narrow paths. It looks like a typical street that runs adjacent to industrial or commercial buildings, with multiple lanes, indicating it is designed to handle a decent amount of traffic rather than being a narrow, winding road.
