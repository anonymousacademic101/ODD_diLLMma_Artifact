NO.

The road in the image is not narrow and winding. It is a straight urban road with multiple lanes that appears to have regular traffic signals and lane markings. There is no indication of any sharp turns or bends that would characterize a winding road. The width of the road can accommodate several lanes of traffic, which does not suggest it is narrow.
