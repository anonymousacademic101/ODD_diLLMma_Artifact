The road in the image appears to be a well-maintained two-lane road with clear lane markings and appears relatively straight in the visible stretch, without any sharp turns or bends. Furthermore, there's a visible barrier on the side nearest the ocean, indicating safety measures for a wider road. It does not seem to be particularly narrow or winding based on the visible section.
