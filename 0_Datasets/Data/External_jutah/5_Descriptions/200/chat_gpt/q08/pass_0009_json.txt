The lanes are wide enough to accommodate standard vehicle traffic, and the road layout is straight in the visible section, showing no signs of winding curves. Additionally, the urban environment suggests a regulated traffic flow with street signs and signals rather than the free-flowing nature of a narrow, winding road.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
