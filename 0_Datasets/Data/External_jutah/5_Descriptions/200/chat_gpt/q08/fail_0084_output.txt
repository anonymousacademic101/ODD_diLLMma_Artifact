The road in the image appears to be a wide urban street with multiple lanes and clear lane markings, set in a built-up area with streetlights and signals. It does not show any characteristics of being narrow or winding; instead, it appears to be a straight section of a city road that can accommodate several lanes of traffic side by side.
