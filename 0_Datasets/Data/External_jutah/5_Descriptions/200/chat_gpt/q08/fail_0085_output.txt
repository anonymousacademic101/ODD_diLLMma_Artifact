The road in the image appears to be a well-lit urban street with clear lane markings, not a narrow and winding road. The presence of traffic lights, crosswalks, and buildings close to the road suggests it is a typical city road designed for steady traffic flow, without the characteristics of narrowness and winding paths typically found on rural or mountainous roads.
