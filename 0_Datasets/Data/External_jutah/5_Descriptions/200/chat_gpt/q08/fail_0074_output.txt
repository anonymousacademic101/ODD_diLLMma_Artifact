NO.

The road depicted in the image is not narrow and winding; it appears to be a straight, multi-lane urban street with clearly marked lanes and ample width for vehicular traffic. There are multiple lanes for cars, marked traffic signals, and well-defined sidewalks, all indicative of a typical city road layout designed to accommodate a moderate to high volume of traffic. The road is running straight through an urban environment with buildings on both sides, and there's no evidence of winding turns in the part of the street shown in the image.
