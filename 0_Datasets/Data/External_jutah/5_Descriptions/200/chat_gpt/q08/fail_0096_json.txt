Additionally, the road in the image appears relatively straight in the visible section, without any evident sharp turns or bends that would classify it as winding. The road seems to be in a well-lit urban area and is approaching a tunnel or an underpass rather than winding through a less structured or rural area where roads are more commonly narrow and winding.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
