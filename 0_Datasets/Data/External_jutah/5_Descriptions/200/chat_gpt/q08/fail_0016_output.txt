The road depicted in the image is not narrow and winding. It appears to be a relatively wide urban street with multiple lanes, including a bicycle lane, and is laid out in a grid pattern, which is typical of many city streets, rather than being winding. The presence of buildings, traffic signals, and signs also indicate that this is an urban setting with straight, planned roads, not narrow, winding ones.
