NO.

The road shown in the image does not appear to be narrow or winding. It looks like a straight urban street with cars parked on both sides, typical of many city settings. There are no visible curves or bends in the road within the scope of the image, and the road seems to comfortably accommodate two lanes of traffic, which does not suggest narrowness by urban standards.
