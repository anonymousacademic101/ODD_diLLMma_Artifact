The road depicted in the image is not narrow and winding; it appears to be a wide, multi-lane urban street with straight sections, typical of city roads designed to accommodate a large volume of traffic. There are multiple lanes in each direction, traffic signals, and clear markings, all indicative of a well-structured urban roadway rather than a narrow, winding road.
