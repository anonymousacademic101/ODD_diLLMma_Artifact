NO

The road shown in the image does not appear to be narrow or winding. Instead, it seems to be a regular, wide urban street with multiple lanes and clear markings. The street runs straight into an intersection, with no visible curves or bends that would indicate it is winding. There are high-rise buildings on both sides, which is typical of city roadways rather than narrow, winding roads, which are more commonly found in rural or mountainous areas.
