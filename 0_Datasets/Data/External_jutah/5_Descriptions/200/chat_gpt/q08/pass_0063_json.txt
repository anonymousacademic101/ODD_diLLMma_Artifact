There are multiple lanes available for traffic, suggesting that it is not narrow, and there are no visible sharp turns or bends in the immediate view to indicate that the road is winding. The environment suggests it is a city road designed to handle a high volume of traffic, which also usually means the road would be designed to reduce sharp turns and maintain a certain width for safety and efficiency.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
