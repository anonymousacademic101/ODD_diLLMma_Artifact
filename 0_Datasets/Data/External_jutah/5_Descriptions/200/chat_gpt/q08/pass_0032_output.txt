The road in the image is not narrow and winding; it is a wide, multi-lane urban street lined with buildings, and it appears to be straight as far as the image shows. The presence of multiple lanes, traffic lights, and clear lane markings indicate an urban road designed to handle significant traffic, as opposed to a narrow and winding road that would typically be found in rural areas or mountainous regions.
