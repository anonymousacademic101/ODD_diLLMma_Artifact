The road in the image is a multi-lane highway with clear markings and apparent straight stretches. It does not appear to be narrow or winding. Instead, it looks to be built for a high volume of traffic with multiple lanes for vehicles, which suggests ample space for driving without the tight maneuvers often associated with narrow and winding roads.
