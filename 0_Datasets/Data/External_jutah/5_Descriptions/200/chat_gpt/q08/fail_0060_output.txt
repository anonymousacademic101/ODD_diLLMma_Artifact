The road in the image is not narrow and winding. It appears to be a multi-lane, straight urban street surrounded by tall buildings, indicative of a city setting rather than a narrow and winding road. Winding roads are more commonly found in hilly or mountainous areas and typically have curves and bends, which this road does not exhibit.
