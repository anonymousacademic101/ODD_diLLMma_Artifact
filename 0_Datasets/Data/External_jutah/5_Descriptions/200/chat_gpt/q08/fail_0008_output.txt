NO

Based on the visible conditions in the image, the road does not appear to be narrow or winding. It seems to be a straight segment of a multi-lane road typical of urban or suburban areas, with clear lane markings and signage visible in the picture. The presence of a bus stop and well-maintained sidewalks also indicates that this is a road within a built-up area designed to handle moderate to heavy traffic, which typically would not be characterized as narrow or winding.
