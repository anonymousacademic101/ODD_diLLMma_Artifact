The image provided does not show a road that is narrow and winding; instead, it appears to show an area with an abandoned or derelict building, overgrown with vegetation, and the road surface visible is fairly straight and flat, although in poor condition with puddles and potential debris. There are no clear signs of a winding path in the part of the road that is visible.
