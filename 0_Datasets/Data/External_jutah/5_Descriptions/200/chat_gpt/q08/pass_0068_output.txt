NO.

The road in the image is wide and appears to have multiple lanes, with a median and clearly marked lanes. It does not show the characteristics of a narrow, winding road, as there are no tight bends or constricted space that would indicate so. Instead, it looks like a typical city street with ample space for traffic in both directions.
