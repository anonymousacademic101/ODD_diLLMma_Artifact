The road shown in the image is not narrow and winding. It appears to be a straight, multi-lane urban street with marked lanes and traffic signals, typical of city streets designed to handle a significant amount of vehicular traffic, pedestrian crossings, and organized traffic flow. It is not characteristic of narrow and winding roads, which are often found in rural or mountainous areas and have twists and turns that follow the natural terrain.
