It is not narrow and winding; rather, it is wide and straight, designed to accommodate buses and regular traffic flow efficiently within an urban setting. The presence of multiple traffic lanes in both directions, lack of any sharp bends, and flat terrain suggest the road is suitable for relatively straightforward navigation and is not characterized by the narrowness or winding nature that might be found on rural or mountainous roads.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
