The road shown in the image appears to be a regular suburban road with multiple lanes. It doesn't look particularly narrow as there seems to be ample space for vehicles in each direction, and there are no visible sharp bends or curves that would typically define a winding road. The traffic is organized with clear lane markings, and there is a designated bike lane as well, suggesting it is a well-structured urban road.
