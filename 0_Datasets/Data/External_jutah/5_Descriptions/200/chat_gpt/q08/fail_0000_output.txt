NO

The road in the image appears to be a straight and wide multi-lane road with no visible winding turns. It seems to be a part of a standard urban road system designed to accommodate multiple vehicles in each direction, as indicated by the multiple lanes and the presence of a median with traffic cones set up for construction or lane management. The spaciousness of the road and its straight path do not suggest it is narrow or winding.
