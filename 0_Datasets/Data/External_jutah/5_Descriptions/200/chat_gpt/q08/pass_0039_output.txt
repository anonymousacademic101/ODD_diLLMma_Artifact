NO.

The road in the image appears to be neither narrow nor winding; it is a straight multi-lane urban street with clearly marked lanes, surrounded by buildings and traffic. Lane restrictions and construction barriers are present due to road work, but the road itself is not showing the characteristics of being narrow or winding.
