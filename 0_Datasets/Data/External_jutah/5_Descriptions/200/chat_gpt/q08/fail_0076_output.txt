The visible section of the road in the image does not appear to be narrow and winding. It seems to be a fairly straight city street with multiple lanes that accommodates parallel parking. The buildings line the street, and vehicles are parked on both sides, indicating that it is a typical urban road rather than a narrow, winding one.
