NO.

The road in the image shows a residential area with a road that appears to be adequately wide for vehicles, with a marked bike lane to the right and a separate sidewalk. The road does curve slightly to the left ahead, but based on what is visible, it does not seem to be especially narrow or winding in the context of typical roads in residential neighborhoods.
