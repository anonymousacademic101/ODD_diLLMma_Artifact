There are multiple lanes visible, separated by dashed lane markings, and the traffic is flowing smoothly without any visible sharp turns or bends that would classify the road as winding. Additionally, the presence of a concrete barrier suggests controlled access, which is typical for wider highways, not narrow roads.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
