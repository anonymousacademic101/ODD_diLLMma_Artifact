Instead, it appears to be a straight section of a road in an urban area, with well-defined lanes and a flat surface. It is difficult to ascertain the exact width of the road from this perspective, but it does not appear to be particularly narrow, and there are no visible curves that would indicate it is winding. The environment suggests an area designed for regular city traffic flow.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
