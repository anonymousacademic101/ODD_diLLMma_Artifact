NO.

The road in the image appears to be a multi-lane highway with ample width for each lane, suitable for high-speed vehicular traffic. There are multiple lanes visible, separated by dashed lane markings, and the traffic is flowing smoothly without any visible sharp turns or bends that would classify the road as winding. Additionally, the presence of a concrete barrier suggests controlled access, which is typical for wider highways, not narrow roads.
