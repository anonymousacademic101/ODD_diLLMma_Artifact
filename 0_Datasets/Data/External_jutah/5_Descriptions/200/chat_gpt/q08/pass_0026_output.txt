The road in the image appears to be a multi-lane urban street with multiple lanes in each direction. It is not narrow, as there are several lanes available for vehicle traffic, and it does not seem to be winding since it appears straight as far as we can see in the image. The presence of traffic signals and urban development on both sides suggests it is a standard, broad street typically found in city environments.
