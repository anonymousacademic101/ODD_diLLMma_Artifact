NO

The road in the image is not narrow or winding. It appears to be a multi-lane urban street with clear lane markers, traffic lights, and a straight pathway under an overpass. There is also construction indicated by traffic cones, suggesting possible lane width reductions, but the road itself does not have the characteristics of being naturally narrow or winding.
