It is not particularly narrow, as it provides enough width for at least two lanes of traffic, and while it does bend, it does not show the characteristics of a tight, winding road often found in more mountainous or steep rural areas. The curve seems smooth and the road is well-marked, suggesting it is designed for typical vehicular traffic without the constraints that would be associated with a narrow and winding road.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
