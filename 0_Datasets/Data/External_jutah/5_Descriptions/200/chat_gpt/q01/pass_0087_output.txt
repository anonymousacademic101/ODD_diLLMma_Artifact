The image appears clear and crisp, with no signs of obstruction, blurriness, or artifacts that would suggest the camera lens was covered or damaged by mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products. Each element in the photo is well-defined, from the street signs and traffic signals to the distant buildings and their lights.
