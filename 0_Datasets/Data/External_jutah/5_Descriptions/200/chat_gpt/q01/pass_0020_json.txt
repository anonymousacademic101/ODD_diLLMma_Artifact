The effect of streaking or blurring lights is a photographic technique achieved by setting the camera's shutter open for a longer duration, allowing more light to enter and thus capturing the motion of light sources. This is not indicative of the camera being obstructed, covered, or damaged; rather, it is a deliberate artistic choice by the photographer to capture a sense of motion and time."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
