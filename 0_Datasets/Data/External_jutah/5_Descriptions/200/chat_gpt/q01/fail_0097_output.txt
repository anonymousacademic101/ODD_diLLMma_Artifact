The image provided appears slightly blurred and taken from a low angle, potentially suggesting a quick shot or movement rather than an obstruction. There are no obvious signs of mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products on the lens that could obstruct the camera's view. The clarity of individual lights and objects in various distances across the image further suggests the lack of any substantial obstruction directly on the camera lens.
