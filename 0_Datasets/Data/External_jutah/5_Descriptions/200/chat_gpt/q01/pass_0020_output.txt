NO.

The image appears to be a long exposure photograph taken in a tunnel, showing light trails from vehicles' tail lights as they move through the tunnel. The effect of streaking or blurring lights is a photographic technique achieved by setting the camera's shutter open for a longer duration, allowing more light to enter and thus capturing the motion of light sources. This is not indicative of the camera being obstructed, covered, or damaged; rather, it is a deliberate artistic choice by the photographer to capture a sense of motion and time.
