The image appears to be clear and without any visible obstructions that would indicate the camera lens was covered by mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products. The details in the scene are sharp, the lights are distinct, and there is no evidence of smearing, blurring, or distortion that would be expected if there were such obstructions on the lens.
