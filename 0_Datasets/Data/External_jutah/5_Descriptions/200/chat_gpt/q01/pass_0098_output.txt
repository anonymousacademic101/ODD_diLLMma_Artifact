The clarity and visibility in the image are quite good. All objects, vehicles, and text are recognizable and there are no distortions indicating that mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products have obstructed, covered, or damaged the camera lens. However, the image does seem a bit hazy, which is likely due to atmospheric conditions like smog or fog, or possibly the camera's exposure settings, rather than the camera itself being dirty or damaged.
