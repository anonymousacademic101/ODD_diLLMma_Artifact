NO.

The quality of the image doesn't suggest an obstruction such as mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products. There are no visible smears, distortions, or patterns that would indicate the camera lens was obstructed or damaged by such substances. However, the image does appear to be out of focus or taken with a low shutter speed, as evidenced by the motion blur on the moving vehicles and the general softness of the stationary objects, which may be mistaken for obstructions on the lens.
