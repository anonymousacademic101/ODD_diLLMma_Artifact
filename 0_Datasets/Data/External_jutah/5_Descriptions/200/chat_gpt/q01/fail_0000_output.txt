The image appears clear and without any obvious distortions or obstructions that would typically be caused by mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products covering the lens. There is no evidence of smudging, blurriness, or other distortions that would suggest the camera lens was compromised in such a way when this photo was taken.
