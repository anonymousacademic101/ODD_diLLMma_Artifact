NO

The image does not exhibit any telltale signs of distortion or obstruction, which would be present if the camera lens were covered in mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products. The details throughout the scene are clear and there are no artifacts that would suggest the lens was compromised in any way. The visibility of fine details like the textures of the building and vegetation, as well as the clarity of colors, indicate that the camera lens was clean at the time the photograph was taken.
