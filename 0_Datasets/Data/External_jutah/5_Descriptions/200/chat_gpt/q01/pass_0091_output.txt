The camera appears to have taken a clear image; the details of the vehicles, buildings, and street are visible without any noticeable distortions or obstructions that would suggest that the camera lens was covered or damaged by mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products. The image lacks any telltale signs of obstruction, such as significant blurring, smearing, or areas where visibility is impaired in a manner consistent with such substances on the lens.
