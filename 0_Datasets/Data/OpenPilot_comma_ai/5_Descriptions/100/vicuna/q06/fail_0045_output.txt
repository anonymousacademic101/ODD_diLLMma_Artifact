Yes, there is construction on the road we are driving on.

The image shows a road at night with streetlights illuminating the area. There are construction cones and barriers on the side of the road, indicating that there is some kind of construction or maintenance work being done on the road. The road appears to be empty, so it is likely that the construction is taking place during the night when there is less traffic on the road.
