The image shows a residential street with a single-story house on the left side of the road and a two-story house on the right side. The houses are made of brick and have pitched roofs. The road is made of asphalt and has a yellow line down the center. There are no cars or pedestrians visible in the image. The time of day appears to be morning, as there is sunlight shining on the houses and the shadows are long. The weather appears to be cloudy, as there are clouds visible in the sky.
