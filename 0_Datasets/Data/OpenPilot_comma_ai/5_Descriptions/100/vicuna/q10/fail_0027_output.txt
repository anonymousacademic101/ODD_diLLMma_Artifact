The image shows a dark, residential street at night. The street is lined with trees on both sides, and there are houses on either side of the road. The road is made of asphalt and has two lanes, one for each direction of traffic. There are no pedestrians or other vehicles visible in the image. The time of day appears to be night, as there are no lights on in the houses or on the street. The image is taken from a low angle, looking up the street.
