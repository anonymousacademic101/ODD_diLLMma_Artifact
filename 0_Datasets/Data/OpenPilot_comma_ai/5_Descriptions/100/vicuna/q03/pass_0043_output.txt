YES, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a dark street with streetlights on either side and a car driving down the middle of the road. The car's headlights are on, illuminating the road ahead. The road appears to be an on-off ramp, as there are no other cars visible in the image and the road seems to be merging into another road that is not visible in the image.
