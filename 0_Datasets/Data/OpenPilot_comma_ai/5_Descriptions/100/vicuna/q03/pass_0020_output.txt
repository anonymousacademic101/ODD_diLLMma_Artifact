Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The on-off ramp is a type of road that allows vehicles to enter or exit a controlled-access highway, such as a freeway or motorway. On-off ramps are typically located at interchanges, where two or more highways meet. They are designed to allow traffic to flow smoothly between the highways and to reduce the risk of accidents.

On-off ramps typically have two lanes, one for traffic entering the highway and one for traffic exiting the highway. They may also have additional lanes for turning or merging traffic. The ramps are designed to provide a smooth and gradual transition between the highways and to reduce the risk of accidents.

On-off ramps are an important feature of controlled-access highways, as they allow traffic to flow smoothly and safely between different parts of a city or region. They also help to reduce congestion and improve the efficiency of the transportation system.
