Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a road that appears to be an on-off ramp, with a guardrail on one side and a concrete wall on the other. The road appears to slope downward, indicating that it is an on-ramp. Additionally, there is a yellow line down the center of the road, which is commonly used to separate oncoming traffic from traffic already on the ramp.
