Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The on-off ramp is a type of road that allows vehicles to enter or exit a controlled-access highway, such as a freeway or motorway. On-off ramps are typically located at interchanges, where two or more highways meet. They are designed to allow vehicles to smoothly transition from one highway to another, or from the highway to an adjacent road or parking lot.

On-off ramps typically have a steep incline or decline to help vehicles gain or lose speed as they enter or exit the highway. They also often have traffic signals or signs to help regulate the flow of traffic and ensure the safety of drivers and pedestrians.

Overall, on-off ramps are an important feature of controlled-access highways, as they allow drivers to easily enter and exit the highway while minimizing disruptions to traffic flow.
