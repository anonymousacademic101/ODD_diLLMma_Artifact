Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The on-off ramp is a type of road that allows vehicles to enter or exit a controlled-access highway, such as a freeway or motorway. On-off ramps are typically located at interchanges, where multiple highways or roads converge. They are designed to provide a safe and efficient way for vehicles to enter or exit the highway while minimizing the impact on traffic flow.

On-off ramps typically have two lanes: one for vehicles entering the highway, and one for vehicles exiting the highway. The entrance and exit lanes are separated by a barrier, such as a guardrail or concrete median, to prevent vehicles from entering or exiting the highway at the wrong time or place.

On-off ramps are important for maintaining the flow of traffic on controlled-access highways, as they allow vehicles to enter or exit the highway without disrupting the flow of traffic on the main lanes. They also help to reduce the risk of accidents by providing a safe and controlled environment for vehicles to enter or exit the highway.
