Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

An on-off ramp is a type of ramp that allows vehicles to enter or exit a highway or other major roadway. On-off ramps are typically used at interchanges, where one road crosses over or under another road. They are designed to provide a smooth and safe transition for vehicles moving between the two roads.

On-off ramps typically have a flat surface and a gentle slope, allowing vehicles to slow down and safely merge onto or off of the main road. They may also have guardrails or other safety features to prevent vehicles from leaving the ramp or entering it at the wrong time or place.

Overall, on-off ramps are an important part of many road systems, helping to facilitate the flow of traffic and ensure the safety of drivers and passengers.
