Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a red car driving down a street with houses and trees on either side. The road appears to be an on-off ramp, as there is a curb on one side and a yellow line separating the road from the sidewalk on the other side. The car is driving in the direction of the on-ramp, which suggests that it is entering or exiting a highway or other major road.
