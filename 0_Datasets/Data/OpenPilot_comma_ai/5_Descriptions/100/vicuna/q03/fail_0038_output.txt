Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The on-off ramp is a type of road that allows vehicles to enter or exit a controlled-access highway, such as a freeway or motorway. On-off ramps are typically located at interchanges, where two or more highways meet. They are designed to provide a smooth and safe transition for vehicles moving between the highways and the surrounding road network.

On-off ramps typically have two or more lanes, with one lane for vehicles entering the highway and one or more lanes for vehicles exiting the highway. They also often have traffic signals or signs to help regulate traffic flow and ensure the safety of drivers and pedestrians.

Overall, on-off ramps play an important role in the functioning of controlled-access highways and help to facilitate the smooth and efficient movement of traffic.
