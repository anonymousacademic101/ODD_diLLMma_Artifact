Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a street with cars parked on both sides of the road and a truck driving on the road. The road appears to be an on-off ramp as it has a solid white line on the left side and a dashed line on the right side, indicating that vehicles can enter or exit the road but not drive straight through it.
