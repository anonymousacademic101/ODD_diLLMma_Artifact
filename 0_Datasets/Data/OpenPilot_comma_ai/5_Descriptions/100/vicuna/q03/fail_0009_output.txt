Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The on-off ramp is a type of interchange that allows traffic to enter or exit a controlled-access highway, such as a freeway or motorway. On-off ramps are typically used to connect local roads to controlled-access highways, allowing drivers to enter or exit the highway at specific points.

On-off ramps are designed to provide a safe and efficient way for drivers to enter or exit the highway, and they are typically located at intersections with local roads or at the ends of controlled-access highways.

On-off ramps are an important feature of controlled-access highways, as they help to reduce congestion and improve traffic flow by allowing drivers to enter or exit the highway at specific points rather than having to travel the entire length of the highway to reach their destination.
