Yes, the image has poor visibility due to the heavy rain.

The image shows a car driving down a street with heavy rain falling from the sky. The visibility is poor due to the rain, making it difficult for the driver to see the road ahead. The car's windshield wipers are working hard to clear the rain from the windshield, but it is still difficult to see through the rain. The street is lined with trees on both sides, providing some cover from the rain, but it is still a challenging situation for the driver.
