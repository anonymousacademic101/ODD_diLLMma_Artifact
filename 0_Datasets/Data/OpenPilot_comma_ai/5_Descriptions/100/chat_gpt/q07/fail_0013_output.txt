The photo appears to be taken at night without any strong direct light sources shining into the camera. There are some light sources visible which seem to be street lights or lights from a vehicle, but they are not extremely bright and do not present glare that would indicate direct sunlight or oncoming headlights shining directly into the camera lens. The overall lighting in the photo is dim and lacks high contrast, suggesting the absence of extremely bright lights.
