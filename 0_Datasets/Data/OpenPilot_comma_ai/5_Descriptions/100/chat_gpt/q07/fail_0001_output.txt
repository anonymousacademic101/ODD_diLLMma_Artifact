The image appears overexposed and washed out in certain areas, indicating that there is a strong light source coming from the direction the camera is facing. This could be due to direct sunlight or possibly bright headlights, although no distinct shape of headlights is discernible. The glare affects visibility and creates a high contrast between the bright and shaded areas, making the details difficult to distinguish.
