YES

The image shows multiple light sources that are relatively bright compared to the surrounding darkness. There is a trace of headlight glare from oncoming traffic, which can be identified by the bright, white lights toward the left side of the image. These lights are significantly brighter than other elements in the picture, indicating they could be from vehicle headlights. Although not 'extremely' bright, they are indeed the brightest spots in the image and can cause glare or reduced visibility when driving at night. There is no direct sunlight evident because the environment is dark, suggesting this is a nighttime scene.
