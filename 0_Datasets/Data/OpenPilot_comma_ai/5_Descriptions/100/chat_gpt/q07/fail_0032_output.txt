The bright area in the image appears to be sunlight reflecting off a bright surface, not direct sunlight into the camera or headlights from a vehicle. There is no indication of the glare that typically accompanies headlights or direct sun exposure, as the light does not have a defined source like oncoming headlights would. Instead, it seems to be bright daylight that is overexposing part of the image, hence the lack of detail in that area.
