The bright area does not exhibit the characteristics of a light source directly hitting the camera's lens, which would cause a lens flare or wash out the image. Instead, the bright area seems to be a portion of the scene that is well-lit by sunlight, creating contrast with the surrounding shadowed areas."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
