NO

The image appears to be taken at night, and while there are several sources of light visible in the distance, such as streetlights and vehicle headlights, none of them are extremely bright or directly shining into the camera lens in such a way that they would cause significant glare or a blinding effect. The headlights are not overexposed in the image, and there is no evidence of direct sunlight, as it is nighttime.
