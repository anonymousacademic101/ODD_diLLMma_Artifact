The image shows a nighttime street scene with various vehicles and street lights. While there are headlights from cars and illumination from street lights, none of them appear to be extremely bright or causing significant glare into the camera lens. The lighting seems typical of traffic at night, without any intense light sources that would imply direct sunlight or excessively bright oncoming headlights in the camera's perspective.
