The image shows a nighttime scene with several points of light that appear to be vehicle headlights and streetlights. Some of these lights are quite bright compared to the surrounding darkness, which causes a glare effect in the camera's lens. This glare can be considered "extremely bright" relative to the low-light environment depicted in the image.
