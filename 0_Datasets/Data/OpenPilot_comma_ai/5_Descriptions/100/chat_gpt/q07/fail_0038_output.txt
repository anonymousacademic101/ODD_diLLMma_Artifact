NO.

The image appears to be taken at nighttime, and while there are some sources of light visible, such as streetlights or vehicle headlights, they are not extremely bright or causing significant glare that would suggest direct sunlight or oncoming headlights shining directly into the camera lens. The overall exposure of the image is quite dark, and the lights present do not overpower the scene.
