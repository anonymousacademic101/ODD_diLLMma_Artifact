NO

The image provided shows a scene without extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight into the camera. All vehicles depicted have their headlights and taillights on, appropriate for dim light conditions, but none of the lights are overpowering the camera's exposure to create extreme brightness. The sky is overcast or it is dusk, which generally results in diffused light conditions with no strong direct sunlight.
