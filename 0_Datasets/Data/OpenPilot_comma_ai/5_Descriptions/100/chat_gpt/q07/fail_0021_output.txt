NO.

The image does show a bright area due to what appears to be sunlight, but it is not overpowering or producing significant glare such as from direct sunlight into the camera or extremely bright headlights from oncoming traffic. The bright area does not exhibit the characteristics of a light source directly hitting the camera's lens, which would cause a lens flare or wash out the image. Instead, the bright area seems to be a portion of the scene that is well-lit by sunlight, creating contrast with the surrounding shadowed areas.
