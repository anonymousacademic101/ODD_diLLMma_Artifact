The image provided is of low resolution and not very clear, but there do not appear to be any extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight overwhelming the camera's sensor or causing significant glare. The environment looks relatively evenly lit without any harsh bright spots that would suggest strong light sources pointed towards the camera.
