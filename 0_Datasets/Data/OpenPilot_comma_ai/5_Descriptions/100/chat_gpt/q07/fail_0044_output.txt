The image displays overexposed areas, likely caused by bright artificial lights such as oncoming headlights in a night setting. These bright spots are overexposed and lack detail, indicating a strong light source directed towards the camera. There's no direct sunlight, as it is a night scene, but the characteristics of the light suggest it could be vehicle headlights or another artificial light source.
