The image shows a night scene on a road with various sources of light, but none are extremely bright or causing significant glare directly into the camera. The lights appear to be at normal brightness levels for nighttime driving conditions, including street lights and the headlights of a few distant vehicles. There is no indication of direct sunlight, as it is clearly nighttime, and the headlights from oncoming traffic are not overpowering or excessively bright in the frame.
