NO

The road appears to run horizontally across the image. It does not seem to be an intersection based on the context provided in the image, as no intersecting roads are visible, and the main focus is on a road extending across the frame. The angle and motion blur suggest we might be in motion parallel to the road rather than approaching or at an intersection.
