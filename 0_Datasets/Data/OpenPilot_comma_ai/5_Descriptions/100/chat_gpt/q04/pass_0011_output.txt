The image shows a section of a road, and based on the context given in the question, it is implied that the road is running horizontally across the image. There is insufficient information to determine if this section of the road is part of an intersection. The perspective suggests that we are viewing the side of a vehicle and the road it is on, which is extending left to right across the frame, rather than straight into an intersection.
