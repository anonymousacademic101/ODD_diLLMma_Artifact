NO.

The road does not appear to be at an intersection, nor does it run horizontally across the image. It seems to be tilted due to the angle of the camera, making the road appear at a diagonal rather than horizontal. The orientation suggests this is a typical stretch of road captured from a skewed angle, not at an intersection or running horizontally across the image.
