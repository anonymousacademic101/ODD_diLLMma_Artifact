NO.

In the provided image, we are not driving on a road. It appears to be a parking lot given the presence of parked cars aligned in rows. The vehicles are parked perpendicularly to the driving lane within the parking area, which means the lanes run vertically in the image rather than horizontally or being at an intersection.
