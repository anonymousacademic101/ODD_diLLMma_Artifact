The road seems to continue on the left and right of the frame without any cross traffic paths that would indicate an intersection. The lighting and the perspective also suggest a continuous, straight path rather than an intersection.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
