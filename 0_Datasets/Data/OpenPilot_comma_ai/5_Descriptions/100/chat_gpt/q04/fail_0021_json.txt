However, the road seems to have a horizontal orientation across the image rather than being part of an intersection. The visible tire marks on the road run parallel to the bottom edge of the image, which also suggests a horizontal road, and there appears to be a curb or barrier that runs along the edge of the road, supporting the idea that the road runs horizontally across the frame. Nonetheless, without a broader view or additional context, it's challenging to conclusively determine the layout of the road."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
