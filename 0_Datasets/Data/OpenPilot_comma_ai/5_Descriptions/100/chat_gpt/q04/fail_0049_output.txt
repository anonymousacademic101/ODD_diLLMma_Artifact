NO.

The image provided is tilted, which might give the impression that the road runs horizontally across the image. However, when considering the proper orientation of the scene, it's clear that the road actually slopes upwards and the white car is parked alongside the upward-sloping road, indicating that the road is not running horizontally in a properly oriented view. There is no visible evidence in this specific image that we are at an intersection, but rather on a portion of a road that would run vertically if the image were correctly oriented. The crosswalk lines also suggest vertical orientation, as they typically don't run horizontally across a street.
