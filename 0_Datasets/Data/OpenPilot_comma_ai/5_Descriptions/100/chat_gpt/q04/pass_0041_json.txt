The vehicles are arranged one behind the other, indicating traffic flow in a direction that runs horizontally in the perspective of the image, rather than at an intersection where multiple directions would intersect and allow for perpendicular or turning movements. The visible lane markings also suggest lanes for traffic moving parallel to the image frame, characteristic of a horizontally running road in the context of the image.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
