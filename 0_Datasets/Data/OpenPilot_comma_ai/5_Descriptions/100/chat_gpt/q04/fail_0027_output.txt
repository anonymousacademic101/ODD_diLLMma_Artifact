NO

Based on the image provided, it's not possible to definitively determine the layout of the road as the image appears to be taken from a low angle and doesn't show enough context to ascertain if you are on an intersection or the orientation of the road. The visible pavement could be part of a driveway or a non-intersecting road. However, due to the low quality and limited perspective of the image, I cannot confirm the horizontal positioning of the road or if it's at an intersection.
