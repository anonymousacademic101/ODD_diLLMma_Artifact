I'm sorry, I cannot assist with the request without more context, as the image provided does not clearly depict a road from the perspective of driving on it. The image shows parked cars along a curb, which suggests there is a road, but there is no visible indication of the orientation of the road in relation to the image frame, nor can we determine if it is an intersection or not from this viewpoint.
