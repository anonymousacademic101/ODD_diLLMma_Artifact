The road does not run horizontally across the image; rather, it appears blurry and unclear whether it's an intersection or not due to the low quality and lighting of the photo, making it difficult to discern the exact layout of the road. However, the presence of vehicle lights and what seems to be a crossing suggests some sort of intersection rather than a road running horizontally across the image.
