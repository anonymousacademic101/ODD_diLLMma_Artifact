The image shows a close-up of vehicles on a road without any visible intersections or cross traffic. The perspective of the image does not give any clear indication of an intersection, and what appears visible is vehicles positioned parallel to each other, typically indicative of a straight segment of road. The road runs horizontally across the image as opposed to showing an intersection where roads would cross each other.
