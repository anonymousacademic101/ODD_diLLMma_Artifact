NO.

The orientation of the road within the field of view of the image is vertical, extending from the bottom to the top of the image frame. It does not run horizontally across the image. We interpret it as "vertical" in this context due to the perspective from which the photo was taken, i.e., from one end of the road looking towards the other. The road is not an intersection in this view; it appears to be a multi-lane highway or road heading in a single direction, with the lanes running parallel to each other in the direction of travel.
