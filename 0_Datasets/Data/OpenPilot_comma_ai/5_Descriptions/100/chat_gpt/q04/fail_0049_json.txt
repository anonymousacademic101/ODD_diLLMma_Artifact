However, when considering the proper orientation of the scene, it's clear that the road actually slopes upwards and the white car is parked alongside the upward-sloping road, indicating that the road is not running horizontally in a properly oriented view. There is no visible evidence in this specific image that we are at an intersection, but rather on a portion of a road that would run vertically if the image were correctly oriented. The crosswalk lines also suggest vertical orientation, as they typically don't run horizontally across a street."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
