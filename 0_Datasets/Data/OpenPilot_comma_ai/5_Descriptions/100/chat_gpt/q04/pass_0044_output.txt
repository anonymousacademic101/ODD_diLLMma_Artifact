The road in the image runs horizontally across the frame. The lanes are visible, with the lane markings indicating traffic flows parallel to the bottom edge of the image. There are no visible signs of an intersection, such as crossing traffic or traffic signals, within the visible section of the road. The vehicles are also arranged in a way that suggests they are driving alongside each other, characteristic of a straight road rather than an intersection.
