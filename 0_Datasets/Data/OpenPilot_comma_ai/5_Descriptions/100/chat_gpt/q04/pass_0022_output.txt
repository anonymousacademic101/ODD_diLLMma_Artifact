The road does not run horizontally across the image; rather, it extends from the foreground to the background, giving the appearance of a vertical path in terms of the image's orientation. An intersection would typically show multiple paths converging or crossing, which is not depicted here. The road perspective suggests a straight path forward, illuminated by the vehicle's headlights and lined with road markings.
