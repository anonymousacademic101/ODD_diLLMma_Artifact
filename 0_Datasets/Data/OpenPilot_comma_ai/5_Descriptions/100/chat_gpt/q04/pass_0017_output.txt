Based on the image, the road appears to run horizontally across the image. The road does not show any signs of an intersection in the visible area, such as traffic signals, cross traffic lanes, or intersecting lines. Instead, it shows a continuous stretch of road with lane markings that suggest a straight path rather than an intersection.
