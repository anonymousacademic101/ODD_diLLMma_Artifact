The road appears to be running horizontally across the image. Based on the orientation and positioning of the vehicles, we can infer this horizontal layout, as the cars are parked parallel to the direction of the road, and there is a car in the foreground that seems to be driving along this horizontal path. There's no clear indication from this viewpoint that we are at an intersection.
