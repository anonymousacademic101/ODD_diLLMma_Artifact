The orientation of the vehicles and the visible lane markings suggest that the road runs horizontally across the image. The photo shows vehicles parallel to the bottom edge of the image, which indicates that this is the direction of the traffic flow on the road. The presence of a crosswalk perpendicular to the direction of the vehicles also supports the idea that this is a horizontal road rather than an intersection from the perspective of the camera.
