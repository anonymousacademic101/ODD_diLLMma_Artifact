NO.

The road in the image does not run horizontally across the image; instead, it appears to extend into the distance, providing a perspective view rather than a flat horizontal cross-section. The lines on the road also converge towards a point in the distance, indicating perspective that is consistent with a road extending away from the viewpoint. There is no clear indication of an intersection in the visible portion of the image.
