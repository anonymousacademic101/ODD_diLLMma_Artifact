NO

Based on the image provided, it appears that the road is running horizontally across the image. There are no visible signs of an intersection in the portion of the road that is illuminated. The road seems to continue on the left and right of the frame without any cross traffic paths that would indicate an intersection. The lighting and the perspective also suggest a continuous, straight path rather than an intersection.
