The image is very blurry, which makes it difficult to discern precise details. However, based on visible road markings, such as crosswalk lines and what appears to be a pedestrian crossing sign, it seems like the road we are viewing is part of an intersection rather than running horizontally across the image. These elements suggest the presence of a crossing or intersection where pedestrian and vehicular paths intersect.
