The road does not run horizontally across the image; instead, it appears that we are on a road with multiple lanes of traffic facing the same direction, suggesting that it is a straight portion of a road or highway rather than an intersection. The traffic seems to be queued up, typically indicative of congestion or a traffic signal ahead, but there is no indication in this image that it is an intersection.
