The image provided is extremely dark and does not offer a clear view of a road. From what is visible, it looks more like a narrow passageway or a residential area rather than a highway or an on-off ramp. An on-off ramp would typically be associated with a freeway or a highway and usually have traffic signs, road markings, and possibly other cars, none of which are discernible in the image provided.
