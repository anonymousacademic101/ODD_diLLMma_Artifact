The sign indicating "MERGE AREA AHEAD" suggests that the section of the road in the image is likely an on-ramp or off-ramp where traffic merges with another road. On-off ramps are typically designed for vehicles to enter or exit freeways, and the signage is used to alert drivers about the need to merge.
