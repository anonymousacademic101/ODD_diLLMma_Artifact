NO.

The image shows a vehicle at a stop with a dashed line that typically indicates a lane for vehicles to merge or change lanes, not an on-off ramp. The vehicles in picture appear to be on a regular road or street rather than an on-off ramp of a freeway. On-off ramps usually do not have such markings and are designed for accelerating to merge onto or decelerate when exiting a highway, not for stopping as seen here.
