The road in the image appears to be an on-off ramp due to the presence of dashed white lines that are typical for lane merges or diverges associated with such ramps. Moreover, the angle and curvature of the lines suggest a transitional roadway connecting a main highway to a local road or another highway, which is characteristic of an on-off ramp.
