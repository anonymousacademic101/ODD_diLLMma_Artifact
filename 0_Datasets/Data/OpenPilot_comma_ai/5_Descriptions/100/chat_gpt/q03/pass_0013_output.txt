YES.

The road shown in the image seems to be a merging lane commonly found on on-ramps or off-ramps, indicated by the dashed white line that is creating a tapering merge area from the right. This is typical of an area where vehicles would be accelerating to merge onto a highway or decelerating to exit onto an off-ramp. Additionally, the traffic congestion and positioning of the vehicles suggest merging activity that is often associated with such ramps.
