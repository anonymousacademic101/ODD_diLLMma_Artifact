NO.

The road in the image appears to be a regular multi-lane highway or freeway rather than an on-off ramp. The characteristics that suggest this include the multiple lanes, the solid white line on the right side indicating the edge of the roadway, and the broken white lines between lanes, which suggest a main travel route as opposed to an on-off ramp that typically narrows down to one lane and has different line marking patterns to indicate entering or exiting a main road. Additionally, there's no sign of the tapering or curvature usually associated with ramps.
