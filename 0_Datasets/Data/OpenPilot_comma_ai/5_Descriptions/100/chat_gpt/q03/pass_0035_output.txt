NO.

The road we are driving on does not appear to be an on-off ramp. The lanes are marked for through traffic rather than for merging or exiting, there are no evident signs or lane markings that typically indicate an on-off ramp, and the presence of multiple lanes of ongoing traffic suggests a highway rather than an on-off ramp.
