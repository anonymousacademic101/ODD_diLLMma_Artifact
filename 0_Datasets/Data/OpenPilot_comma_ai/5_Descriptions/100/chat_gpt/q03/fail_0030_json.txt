An on-off ramp would generally be connected to a highway or motorway and is designed to allow vehicles to enter or exit at higher speeds. This road looks more like a local street or an access road due to the urban surroundings and the presence of a building and what appears to be a stationary object or signage on the right side of the road. On-off ramps usually do not have such proximity to buildings, nor do they feature such objects close to the roadway, as they could pose a risk for the merging traffic.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
