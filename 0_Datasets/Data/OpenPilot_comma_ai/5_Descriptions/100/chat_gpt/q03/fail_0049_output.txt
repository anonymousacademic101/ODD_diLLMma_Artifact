The image appears to be of a common city street or an access road, rather than a highway on-off ramp, indicated by the visible parallel-parked car on the right and the presence of buildings directly adjacent to the road. On-off ramps typically connect highways to local roads and do not have such features as street parking. There also appears to be a slight incline, which is more characteristic of urban roads as opposed to the more regulated designs of highway ramps.
