The road in the image appears to be a regular multi-lane road or highway, not specifically an on-off ramp. On-off ramps typically have a more distinct curvature and connect highways to local roads, while the road in the image appears to continue straight ahead without showing signs of the distinctive curves or exits found in on-off ramps. Additionally, there are multiple lanes marked with dashed lines suggesting mainline traffic rather than an off-ramp or on-ramp which usually transitions into a single lane while curving away from or towards a highway.
