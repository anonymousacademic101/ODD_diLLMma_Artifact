We can deduce this because there are parked cars visible on either side of the narrow lane, indicating that it's a space intended for vehicles to be stationary, which is typical of a parking lot environment. On-off ramps typically do not have parked cars and are designed to facilitate the flow of traffic onto or off of a highway or major road. Additionally, on-off ramps generally have wider lanes and lack the parking lines seen here."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
