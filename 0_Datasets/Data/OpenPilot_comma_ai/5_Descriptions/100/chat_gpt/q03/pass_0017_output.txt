NO.

The road shown in the image does not have the typical characteristics of an on-off ramp. On-off ramps are usually designed to facilitate the acceleration or deceleration of vehicles as they enter or exit a highway, and they tend to have a curved shape and distinct signage indicating an entrance or exit. The road in the image appears to be a straight section of a multi-lane road with a dashed line separating lanes, which is more indicative of a standard roadway or highway rather than an on-off ramp.
