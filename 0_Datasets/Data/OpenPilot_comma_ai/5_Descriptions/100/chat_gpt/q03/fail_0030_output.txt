NO.

The road in the image does not display typical features of an on-off ramp. An on-off ramp would generally be connected to a highway or motorway and is designed to allow vehicles to enter or exit at higher speeds. This road looks more like a local street or an access road due to the urban surroundings and the presence of a building and what appears to be a stationary object or signage on the right side of the road. On-off ramps usually do not have such proximity to buildings, nor do they feature such objects close to the roadway, as they could pose a risk for the merging traffic.
