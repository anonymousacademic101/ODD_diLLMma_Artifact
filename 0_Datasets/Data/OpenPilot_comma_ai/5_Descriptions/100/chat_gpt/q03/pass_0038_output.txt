Based on the image provided, the road appears to be a typical two-lane road with yellow dividing lines suggesting it is a two-way traffic road, not an on-off ramp. On-off ramps typically have different markings and are designed to connect roads with highways or interstates, and this road does not exhibit common characteristics of an on-off ramp, such as a single direction of travel or merge signs.
