NO.

This road does not appear to be an on-off ramp; it looks like a multi-lane highway or freeway. On-off ramps typically have a single lane for entering or exiting a freeway, and the lanes tend to curve or merge off of the main lanes of the highway. This image shows multiple lanes traveling in the same direction, which is typical for a highway or freeway, and there's no visible curvature or divergence that would indicate an on-off ramp.
