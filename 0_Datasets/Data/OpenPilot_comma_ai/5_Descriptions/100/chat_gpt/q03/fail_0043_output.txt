NO.

The image provided is of low quality and does not clearly depict the road or its features. Therefore, I cannot definitively determine from this image if the road in question is an on-off ramp. An on-off ramp typically has certain characteristics such as leading to or from a highway or expressway, having curvature or a merging lane, and having signage indicating the beginning or end of a freeway. These details are not visible or clear in the provided image.
