The image appears to show a road with dashed lines that are typical for lanes where vehicles can enter or exit a highway (on-ramps or off-ramps). The angle of divergence from the main lanes suggests that this is a lane separating from the main flow of traffic, which is characteristic of an on-ramp or off-ramp.
