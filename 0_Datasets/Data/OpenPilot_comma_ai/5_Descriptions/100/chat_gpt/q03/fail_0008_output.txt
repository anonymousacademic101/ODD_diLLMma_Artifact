The curved nature of the road, the appearance of a solid white line that typically demarcates the shoulder of the road, and the guardrail suggest that this could indeed be an on-off ramp, which commonly features these characteristics. Additionally, the lack of visible traffic signals or intersections aligns with the typical layout of on-off ramps, which serve as transition points between major roads and local routes.
