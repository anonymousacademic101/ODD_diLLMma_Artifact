Additionally, the lines and lighting give the impression of a roadway designed for connecting with a highway or major road, which is the purpose of on-off ramps. However, without additional context or clearer signage, this observation is based on common road design features and the image provided.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
