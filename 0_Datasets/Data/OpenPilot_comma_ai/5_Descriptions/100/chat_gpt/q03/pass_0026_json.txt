The lane markings and arrow symbols, which imply either merging or diverging traffic, support the notion that this could be an on-ramp or an off-ramp. Additionally, the absence of other intersections or traffic signals in the visible area further suggests this is a ramp designed to handle vehicles entering or leaving a highway.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
