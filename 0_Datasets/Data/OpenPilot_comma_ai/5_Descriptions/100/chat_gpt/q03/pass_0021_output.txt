NO.

The image shows a road with multiple lanes and a dashed line that suggests it's either a main road or a highway. On-off ramps typically have solid lines indicating the edge of the ramp and do not have dashed lines between lanes since they are not meant for overtaking. Furthermore, the visible traffic signs do not indicate the presence of on-off ramp features like merging or exit signs. The road seems to continue straight ahead without the curvature often associated with ramps.
