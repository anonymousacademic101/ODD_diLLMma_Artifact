The image provided seems to show a regular urban or suburban street rather than an on-off ramp. On-off ramps are typically associated with highways or freeways and are designed for vehicles to enter or exit at high speeds. Features such as the presence of driveways and the curbside suggest this is a local road rather than a ramp designed for highway access.
