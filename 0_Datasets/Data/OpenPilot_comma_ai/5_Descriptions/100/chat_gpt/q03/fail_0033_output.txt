The image provided shows a regular road with a vehicle parked on the side, which is typical for urban or residential streets, not for on-off ramps. On-off ramps are generally connected to highways or freeways and don't have vehicles parked alongside them. Moreover, the surroundings appear to be more residential or urban in nature rather than the more transactional environment of highway ramps.
