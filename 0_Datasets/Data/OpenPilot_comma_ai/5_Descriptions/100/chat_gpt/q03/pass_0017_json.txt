On-off ramps are usually designed to facilitate the acceleration or deceleration of vehicles as they enter or exit a highway, and they tend to have a curved shape and distinct signage indicating an entrance or exit. The road in the image appears to be a straight section of a multi-lane road with a dashed line separating lanes, which is more indicative of a standard roadway or highway rather than an on-off ramp.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
