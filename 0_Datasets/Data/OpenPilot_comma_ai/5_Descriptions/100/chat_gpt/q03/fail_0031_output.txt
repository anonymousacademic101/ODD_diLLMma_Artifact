NO.

I cannot provide a definitive answer as to whether the road is an on-off ramp based solely on the provided image. The image shows a section of pavement with some road markings, but does not offer enough context to accurately determine the nature of the road. On-off ramps typically have specific design characteristics such as curvature, signage, and connectivity to a highway or major road, none of which can be observed in the given image.
