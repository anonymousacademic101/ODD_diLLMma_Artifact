YES

Based on the available evidence which includes blurred lines that seem to suggest motion and a curving trajectory, it is possible that this could be an on-off ramp due to the curvature and the typical motion blur associated with a vehicle taking a ramp at speed. However, without clearer visual information, this conclusion is tentative and based on limited context.
