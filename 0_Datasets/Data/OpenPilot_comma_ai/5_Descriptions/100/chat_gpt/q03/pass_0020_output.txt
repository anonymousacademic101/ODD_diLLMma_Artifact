NO.

The image shows a road with lanes that are marked by continuous lines, suggesting it is a main road or highway rather than an on-off ramp. On-off ramps typically have merge or exit lanes and may have broken lines indicating where vehicles can enter or exit the main flow of traffic. The road in the image does not display these features and appears to be a straight section of a highway or similar road, not an on-off ramp.
