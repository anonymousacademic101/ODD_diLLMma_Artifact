NO.

The image provided seems to depict a regular stretch of road at night, characterized by lane markings consistent with a typical highway or rural road. The presence of a solid white line on the right suggests a boundary of the road, while the dashed white lines indicate lane divisions for traffic moving in the same direction. On-off ramps typically have distinct characteristics such as curving exit/entrance trajectories, signage indicating an approaching exit or entrance, and often different lane marking patterns to signal the divergence from the main roadway or the convergence onto it. Since none of these distinctive features are clearly visible, there is no conclusive evidence to indicate this is an on-off ramp.
