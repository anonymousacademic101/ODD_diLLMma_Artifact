NO.

The image provided shows a road, but the angle and details present are insufficient to conclusively determine the type of road. There are no clear signs or defining characteristics indicating that it is specifically an on-off ramp. An on-off ramp typically connects freeway or highway lanes to local roads and often has signage, acceleration/deceleration lanes, or other characteristics, none of which can be clearly identified in this image.
