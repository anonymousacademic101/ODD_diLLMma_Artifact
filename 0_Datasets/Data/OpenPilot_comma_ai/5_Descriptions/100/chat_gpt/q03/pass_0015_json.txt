An on-off ramp typically is a single lane that diverges from or converges with a highway to enable vehicles to enter or exit, and it usually has a noticeable curving path or signage indicating the ramp's function. The road in the image lacks these characteristics and thus does not seem to be an on-off ramp."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
