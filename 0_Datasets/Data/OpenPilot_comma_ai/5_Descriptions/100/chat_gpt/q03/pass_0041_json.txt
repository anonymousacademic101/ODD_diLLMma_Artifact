The vehicles in picture appear to be on a regular road or street rather than an on-off ramp of a freeway. On-off ramps usually do not have such markings and are designed for accelerating to merge onto or decelerate when exiting a highway, not for stopping as seen here.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
