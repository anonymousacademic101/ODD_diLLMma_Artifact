This road looks like a regular two-lane rural or suburban road, as indicated by the double yellow lines marking no passing zones and the absence of features such as acceleration or deceleration lanes that are characteristic of on-off ramps. Additionally, the presence of a mailbox on the side suggests it is more likely a local road and not part of a highway system's on-off ramp structure."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
