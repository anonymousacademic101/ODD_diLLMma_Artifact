NO.

The road depicted in the image looks like a typical urban street or a parking lot. It can be identified by the parking spots on either side and the pedestrian crosswalk. These features are not typically found on on-off ramps, which are designed to manage the flow of traffic between different levels of a roadway, such as highways and interstates. On-off ramps generally do not include parking spaces and have different road markings to guide vehicles entering or exiting at higher speeds.
