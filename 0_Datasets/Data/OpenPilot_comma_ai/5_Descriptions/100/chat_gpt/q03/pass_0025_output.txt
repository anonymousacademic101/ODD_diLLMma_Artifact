YES

The road in the image appears to be an on-off ramp due to several characteristics typical of such ramps: the curving nature of the road, the dashed line on the right indicating an area where vehicles can merge or exit the road, and the absence of any intersecting traffic or crossroads which are typically not present on on-off ramps. Additionally, the lines and lighting give the impression of a roadway designed for connecting with a highway or major road, which is the purpose of on-off ramps. However, without additional context or clearer signage, this observation is based on common road design features and the image provided.
