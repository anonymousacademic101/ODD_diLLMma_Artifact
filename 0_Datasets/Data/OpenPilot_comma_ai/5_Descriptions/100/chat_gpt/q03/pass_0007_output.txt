Based on the image provided, the road appears to be a multi-lane highway or freeway with multiple vehicles traveling in parallel lanes. On-off ramps typically have a single lane for entering or exiting the main roadway and would not have multiple lanes of traffic moving alongside each other. The lanes are marked with dashed lines that are characteristic of regular traffic lanes on a highway, rather than the solid lines and tapering typically seen on ramps.
