NO.

The image provided shows a road with a curving barrier on the right side and a dashed white line marking the lane on the left side. The structure of the road could suggest it is a ramp of some sort, possibly an on-ramp or off-ramp, but there is not enough visual context to conclusively identify it as such. Without signs, exits, additional road lanes, or a highway in the immediate view, I cannot confirm that the road is specifically an on-off ramp.
