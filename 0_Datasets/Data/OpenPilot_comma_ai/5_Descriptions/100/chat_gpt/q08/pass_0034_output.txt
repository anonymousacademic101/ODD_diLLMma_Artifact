NO

The road in the image appears to be a multi-lane highway with marked lanes and sufficient width to accommodate multiple vehicles side by side, which does not fit the description of a narrow road. It also appears to be fairly straight in the visible section, without visible sharp turns or bends that would suggest it is winding.
