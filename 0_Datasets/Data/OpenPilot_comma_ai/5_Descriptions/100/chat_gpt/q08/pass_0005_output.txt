NO.

The road appears to be a multilane road with multiple vehicles visible and driving in parallel lanes. The image shows traffic congestion, and the vehicles are close together, indicating it is more likely a highway or a major city road rather than a narrow and winding road. There are no visible curves or bends that would suggest the road is winding, and the straight positioning of the cars indicates a straight section of road.
