The road in the image appears to curve to the left, and given the limited field of view and the absence of additional lanes visible, it could be considered narrow. However, without further context such as a longer stretch of the road or the ability to see beyond this section, it's difficult to definitively classify the road as winding overall; it could just be a single curve. The term "winding" typically implies a series of bends and turns rather than a single curve.
