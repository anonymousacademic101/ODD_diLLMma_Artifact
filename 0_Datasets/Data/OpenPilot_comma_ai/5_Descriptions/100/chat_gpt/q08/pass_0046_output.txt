The image provided shows a section of a road with multiple lanes, street lights, and what appears to be a sign that might indicate a turn or intersection ahead. The visible part of the road does not look particularly narrow, and while the sign suggests there could be a curve ahead, the immediate visible stretch of road is not winding.
