No.

From the perspective shown in the image, the road does not appear to be narrow or winding. It seems to be a straight section of a roadway, possibly a highway or a multi-lane road, with clearly marked lanes and a barrier to the side. There are no visible sharp turns or curves that would indicate it's winding, and the width of the road is sufficient to accommodate multiple lanes of traffic, indicating it is not narrow.
