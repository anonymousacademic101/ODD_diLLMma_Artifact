However, from the visible section, the road appears to be straight rather than winding. There is no clear curvature or bends visible in the part of the road shown in the image. As for the width, it appears to be of standard width for a single lane of traffic, not particularly narrow. Without further context or more of the road visible, it's not possible to categorically say that the road is narrow and winding."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
