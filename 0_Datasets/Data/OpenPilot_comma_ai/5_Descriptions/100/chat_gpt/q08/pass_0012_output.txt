Although the image quality is poor and details are scarce, the road depicted doesn't appear to be particularly narrow or winding based on the visible section. There seems to be enough space for two vehicles to pass side by side comfortably, which suggests the road is not narrow. Additionally, there is no clear evidence of sharp turns or curves in the visible stretch of road that would indicate it is winding.
