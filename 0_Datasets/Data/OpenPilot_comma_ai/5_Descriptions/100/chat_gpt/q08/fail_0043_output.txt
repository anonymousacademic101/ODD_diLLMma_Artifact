The image provided is blurry and taken at night, making it difficult to accurately assess the road conditions. However, based on the available information, we cannot confirm that the road is narrow and winding, as the image does not clearly show the road's width or curvature. The visible information suggests a street scene that may not necessarily be characterized as narrow and winding.
