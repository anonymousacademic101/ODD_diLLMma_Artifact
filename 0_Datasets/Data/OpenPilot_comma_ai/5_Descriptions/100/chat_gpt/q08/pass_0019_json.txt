The presence of lane markings that curve indicates the road is winding in this section. The width of the road cannot be clearly determined from this angle, especially due to the darkness and the camera\'s focus on the center of the road. Therefore, the characterization of the road as "narrow" is subjective without a wider view or more context. However, you referred to it as such, so based on the visible winding aspect and your description, we can affirm the road is winding and, according to your perspective, narrow.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
