NO.

The image you've provided appears to show a driveway or possibly a pedestrian pathway leading up to a garage door, rather than a road intended for driving. There is no clear indication that the path is winding or that this is a road used by vehicles for primary transportation. Furthermore, due to its narrowness and the presence of the garage, it's more likely to be private property access than a public road.
