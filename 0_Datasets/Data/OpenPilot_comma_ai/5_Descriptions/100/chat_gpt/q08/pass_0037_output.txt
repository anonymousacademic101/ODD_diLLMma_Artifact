YES

The road in the image appears to be winding as it has curves that meander rather than forming a straight line. However, it is difficult to accurately assess the width from this perspective. Generally, the term "narrow" is relative and subjective, but considering the visible lanes and markings, the road does not seem particularly narrow in the context of standard two-lane rural roads. So, my response is primarily based on the visible winding aspect.
