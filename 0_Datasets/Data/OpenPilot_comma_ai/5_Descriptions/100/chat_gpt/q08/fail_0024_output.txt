The image provided is too blurry and lacks detail, making it impossible to accurately judge the characteristics of the road. Visibility is limited, and there are no clear indications of curves or the width of the road that would suggest it is narrow and winding. Without a clearer view or additional context, a definitive assessment cannot be made.
