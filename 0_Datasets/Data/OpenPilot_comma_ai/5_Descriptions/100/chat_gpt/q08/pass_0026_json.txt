However, without further context such as a longer stretch of the road or the ability to see beyond this section, it\'s difficult to definitively classify the road as winding overall; it could just be a single curve. The term "winding" typically implies a series of bends and turns rather than a single curve.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
