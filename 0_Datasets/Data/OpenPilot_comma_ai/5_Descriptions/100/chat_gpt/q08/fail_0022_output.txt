NO.

The image provided shows only a small section of a road, making it difficult to determine the overall width and curvature of the road ahead. However, from this section alone, the road does not appear particularly narrow or winding; it seems to be a straight path from the visible perspective. Additionally, the context within the image is insufficient to accurately describe the nature of the road beyond this section.
