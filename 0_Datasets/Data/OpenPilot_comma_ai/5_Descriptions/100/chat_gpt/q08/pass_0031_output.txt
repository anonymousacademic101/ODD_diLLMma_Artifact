The road in the image appears to be a straight, multi-lane urban street with clearly marked lanes, which does not fit the description of "narrow and winding." It looks to be designed for a fair amount of traffic and provides ample space for vehicles, unlike narrow and winding roads which typically have limited space and involve a lot of curves.
