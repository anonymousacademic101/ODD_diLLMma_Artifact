Yes.

The image provided seems to be cropped and does not show a road. Therefore, based on the provided image, I am unable to assess the terrain of the road. However, if you were asking about a road you are currently on and described it as hilly, I would have no visual evidence to confirm or dispute your experience of the road. I can only base my response on the information or images provided to me.
