The image quality is low and itâ€™s dark, making it difficult to accurately discern the topography of the road. There are no clear visual indicators of significant inclines or declines that would suggest the road is hilly within the visible portion of the image. However, without a wider view or better lighting, it's not possible to conclusively determine the overall topography of the area.
