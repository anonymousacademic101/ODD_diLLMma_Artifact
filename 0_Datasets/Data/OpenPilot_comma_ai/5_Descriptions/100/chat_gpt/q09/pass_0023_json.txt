The perspective shows a straight road and the lane markings are uniform without any curvature that would suggest hills. However, it's important to note that the field of vision is limited, and the road could potentially become hilly beyond what is shown in the photograph."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
