Although it is difficult to determine the steepness of the hills due to the darkness and the angle of the image, the road appears to be undulating, which indicates that it is hilly. There is a visible incline ahead, with the lights of vehicles in the distance appearing at a higher elevation than those closer to the camera. This suggests that the road has a sloping contour.
