Based on the provided image, it is not possible to determine the overall topography of the road since the view is obstructed by the vehicles ahead. The road immediately visible in the image appears relatively flat, with no visible inclines or declines that would indicate a hilly road. The image primarily shows the rear view of cars in what looks like congested traffic, which does not provide sufficient context to gauge the hilliness of the road.
