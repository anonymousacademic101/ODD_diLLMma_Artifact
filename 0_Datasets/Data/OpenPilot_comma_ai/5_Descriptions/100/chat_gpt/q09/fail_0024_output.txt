Yes.

The lighting in the image is poor, and details are blurred, but there appears to be a slight incline in the road ahead, indicating a potential hill. The illumination from the headlights seems to cast elongated shadows from objects on the side of the road, which often happens when a vehicle approaches an incline. However, due to the low resolution and darkness, this assessment is somewhat speculative.
