NO.

The image shows a road at night with visible lane markings that appears mostly flat in the immediate foreground. There are no visible inclines or declines that would indicate hills within the portion of the road we can see. However, without seeing further along the road, we cannot definitively conclude whether there are hills beyond the visible range. The assessment is based solely on the visible section of the road in the image.
