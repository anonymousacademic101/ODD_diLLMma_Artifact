NO.

The image provided does not show a road being driven on at all. Instead, it appears to show a stationary scene, likely taken in a parking lot with parked cars. The focus and angle of the image do not allow for assessment of terrain or road conditions, hence why the question about the road being hilly cannot be confirmed from this image.
