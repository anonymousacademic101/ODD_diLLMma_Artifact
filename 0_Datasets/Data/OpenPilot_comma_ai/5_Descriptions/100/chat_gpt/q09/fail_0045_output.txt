The image shows a road with visible undulations, but the term 'hilly' typically describes a road having a succession of significant slopes and inclines. The image provided does not clearly depict the extent or the severity of the slopes to conclude that the road is hilly. The perspective gives an impression of a slight incline, but the context is insufficient to describe it as hilly.
