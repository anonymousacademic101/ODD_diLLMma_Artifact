Based on the visible information, there is no clear signage or road markings indicating that there are restricted lanes on the part of the road shown in the image. We see what appears to be a standard traffic lane without any special markings for bus or bicycle lanes. However, it is important to note that the image does not provide a full view of the entire road, so there could be restricted lanes outside of the field of view.
