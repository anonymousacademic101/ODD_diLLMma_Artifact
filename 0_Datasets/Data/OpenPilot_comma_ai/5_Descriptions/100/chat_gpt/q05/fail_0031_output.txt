Based on the image provided, it is not possible to conclusively determine whether there are any restricted lanes such as bus lanes or bicycle lanes on the road because the view is too limited to observe any lane markings or traffic signs that might indicate such restrictions. The image only shows a fragment of the road surface without enough context to identify specific lane designations.
