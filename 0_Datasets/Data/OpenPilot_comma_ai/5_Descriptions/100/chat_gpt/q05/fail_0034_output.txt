The image provided is too dark and lacks detail to reliably determine the road conditions and lane restrictions. Furthermore, the angle and framing of the image focus on a sign that appears to be related to construction or maintenance rather than indicating lane restrictions for specific vehicle types like buses or bicycles. It is not possible to identify any specific lane restrictions from this image alone.
