The image shows a road with a lane that is marked as "KEEP CLEAR" which often indicates an area that should not be blocked, possibly due to it being a crosswalk or an entrance to a side road, driveway, or possibly a bus lane. This marking does not necessarily imply a restriction such as a bus or bicycle lane, but "KEEP CLEAR" itself is a type of restriction intended to prevent vehicles from waiting or parking in that space, keeping it unobstructed for certain uses which may include buses depending on the specific road regulations.
