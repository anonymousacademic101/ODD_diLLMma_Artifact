NO

Based on the image provided, there are no visible signs or road markings that indicate there are restricted lanes designated specifically for buses, bicycles, or other vehicle types. It appears to be a standard road with no special lane restrictions evident from this perspective. However, it's worth noting that some lane restrictions might not be visible at night or from a certain angle in a photograph, so while they can't be seen here, that doesn't categorically rule out their existence on other parts of the road.
