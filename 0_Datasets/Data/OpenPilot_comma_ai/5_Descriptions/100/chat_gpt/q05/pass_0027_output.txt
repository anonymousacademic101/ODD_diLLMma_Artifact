I'm sorry, but I cannot provide a definitive answer based on the given image, as it does not clearly indicate whether there are any restricted lanes. The image's low lighting and angle do not provide enough detail to make out specific lane designations, such as markings or signs that would indicate a lane is reserved for buses, bicycles, or other special use.
