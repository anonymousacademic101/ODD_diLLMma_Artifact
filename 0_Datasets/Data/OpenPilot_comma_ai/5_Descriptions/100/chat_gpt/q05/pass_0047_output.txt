Based on this image, it is not possible to definitively determine if there are restricted lanes for buses or bicycles. The quality and field of view provided do not clearly show lane markings, signage, or symbols that would indicate the presence of such restricted lanes. Therefore, without additional information or a clearer view, we cannot ascertain the presence of restricted lanes.
