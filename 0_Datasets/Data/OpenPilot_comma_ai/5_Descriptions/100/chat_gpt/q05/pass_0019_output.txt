NO.

Based on the provided image, we can see a road with lane markings, but there are no visible signs or road surface markings that explicitly indicate any sort of restricted lanes such as bus or bicycle lanes. Additionally, the image is taken at night which makes it harder to decipher many details, and without further context or clearer indicators, we cannot ascertain the presence of restricted lanes.
