NO.

The image provided is low-resolution and taken at an angle that doesn't show the entire road, thus limiting the visibility of road markings or signs that would indicate restricted lanes for buses or bicycles. From what is visible, there are no clear indications of such restrictions. However, without a full view of the road and its signage, a definitive answer cannot be provided.
