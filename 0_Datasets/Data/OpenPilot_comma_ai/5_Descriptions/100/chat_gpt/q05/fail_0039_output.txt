NO.

Based on the image provided, there is no clear signage or road markings visible that indicate the presence of any restricted lanes, such as bus lanes or bicycle lanes. The image shows a general view of a road during a time of low visibility, and such specific details are not discernible. Therefore, I cannot confirm the presence of restricted lanes.
