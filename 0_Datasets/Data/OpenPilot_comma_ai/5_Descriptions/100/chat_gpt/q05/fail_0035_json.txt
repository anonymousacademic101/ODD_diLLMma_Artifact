This marking does not necessarily imply a restriction such as a bus or bicycle lane, but "KEEP CLEAR" itself is a type of restriction intended to prevent vehicles from waiting or parking in that space, keeping it unobstructed for certain uses which may include buses depending on the specific road regulations.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
