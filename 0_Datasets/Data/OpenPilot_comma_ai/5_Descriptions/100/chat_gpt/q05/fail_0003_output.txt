NO.

The image provided is of such low resolution and size that it's difficult to determine the specifics of the road conditions, including any possible restricted lanes. There are no clearly visible signs or road markings that indicate the presence of restricted lanes. Additionally, the image appears to be taken in a parking lot rather than on a road, making the presence of restricted lanes such as bus or bicycle lanes even less likely.
