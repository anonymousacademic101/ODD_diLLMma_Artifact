Based on the image provided, there are no visible indications such as lane markings or signage that denote restricted lanes specifically for buses, bicycles, or other types of vehicles. The visible road markings suggest standard vehicular lanes, and it is nighttime, which can make it more challenging to identify if there are any restricted lanes unless appropriately marked or signed.
