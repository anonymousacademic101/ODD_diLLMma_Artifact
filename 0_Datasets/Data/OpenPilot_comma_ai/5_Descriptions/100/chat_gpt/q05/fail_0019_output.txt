The image provided shows a road at night with very limited visibility and does not provide enough context or visual information to definitively identify any road markings or signs that would indicate the presence of restricted lanes, such as bus lanes or bicycle lanes. Without clear indicators, such as road markings, signage, or infrastructure that is specific to restricted lanes, it is not possible to accurately state whether there are any such lanes on this road.
