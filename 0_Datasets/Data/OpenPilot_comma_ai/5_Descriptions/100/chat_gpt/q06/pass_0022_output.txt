NO

From the provided image, there are no clear signs of construction visible on the road ahead. There are no construction barriers, equipment, workers, or road work signs that can be seen in the image. The road surface appears to be continuous and without any interruptions that would indicate construction activity. However, the image quality is not high and the view is limited, so it cannot be conclusively determined if there is construction further down the road beyond the field of view or in poorly lit areas.
