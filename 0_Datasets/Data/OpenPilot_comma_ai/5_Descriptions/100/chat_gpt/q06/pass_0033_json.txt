There are cones placed on the left side of the lane, indicating a sectioned off area typically used for construction activities. Additionally, the pattern of traffic flow is altered, with the right lane appearing to be closed off due to the cones redirecting traffic. This kind of setup is a common temporary arrangement to facilitate roadwork while allowing traffic to pass through the construction zone safely.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
