The image provided shows a view of a road at night with vehicles, but there are no visible signs of construction such as construction equipment, barriers, workers, or closed lanes that would indicate ongoing road work. The road appears to be in normal use by traffic without any obstructions that would suggest construction activity. However, it is important to note that limited visibility at night might obscure some details, so this assessment is based on the visible evidence in the image provided.
