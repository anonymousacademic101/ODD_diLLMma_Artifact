NO.

The image provided does not give a clear view of an open road where one would typically see construction activity. It shows a driveway leading up to a garage door, and there are no visible signs of construction such as cones, barriers, construction vehicles, or workers. The view is limited and does not include a public road, but rather a private driveway, and there's no evidence of construction in this specific frame.
