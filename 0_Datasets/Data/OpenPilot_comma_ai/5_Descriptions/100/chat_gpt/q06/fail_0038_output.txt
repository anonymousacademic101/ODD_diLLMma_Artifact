NO

The image provided is too dark and lacks detail to definitively identify any signs of road construction. There are no clear markers, construction equipment, road work signs, or visible construction barriers that indicate ongoing construction in the portion of the road visible in the image. However, without broader visibility and a clearer picture, it's not possible to confirm the absence of construction beyond the immediate area shown.
