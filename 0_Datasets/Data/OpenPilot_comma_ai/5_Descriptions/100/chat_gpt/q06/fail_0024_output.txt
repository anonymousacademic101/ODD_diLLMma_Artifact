The image provided is very dark and blurry, making it difficult to accurately identify any specific details that would indicate construction on the road. There are no clear signs of construction such as cones, barriers, heavy machinery, or active construction workers that are discernible from this image. However, without higher resolution or further context, a definitive statement cannot be made about the presence of construction on the road simply based on this image.
