NO.

Based on the available image, there is no visible construction activity on the road we are driving on. The lanes are clear and there are no construction barriers, equipment, or workers visible in the image. However, there is something that looks like construction in the distant background to the right, but it is not affecting the road where the vehicle is currently driving.
