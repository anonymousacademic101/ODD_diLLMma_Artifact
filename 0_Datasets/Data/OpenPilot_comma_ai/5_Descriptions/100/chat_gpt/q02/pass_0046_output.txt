NO.

The image provided shows a road that appears to be curving or bending, but the term "sharp curve" suggests a more abrupt change in direction than what is depicted. While it is difficult to determine the exact curvature from the perspective shown, the visible road marks and signs indicate a curve but not necessarily one that would be categorized as sharp. The "SHARP CURVE AHEAD" sign indicates a sharp curve is forthcoming, but the visible section of the road in the immediate foreground does not yet display a sharp curve.
