The image provided appears to be a photograph that's been taken with a rolling shutter effect, which can distort the image and make straight lines appear curved. This effect is common in CMOS camera sensors where the sensor scans the scene line-by-line rather than capturing it all in one go. In reality, the road may actually be straight, but the distortion makes it look like it's curving.
