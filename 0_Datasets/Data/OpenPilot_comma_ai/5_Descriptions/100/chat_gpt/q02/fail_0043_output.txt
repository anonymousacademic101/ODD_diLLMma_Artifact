The image provided is too blurry to ascertain the curvature of the road with certainty. However, from the visible information, it appears that the part of the road we can see does not show a sharp curve but rather a straight segment. The lighting and the patterns suggest a typical straight urban street scenario. Without more clarity or additional context, determining the exact nature of the road's curvature is not possible.
