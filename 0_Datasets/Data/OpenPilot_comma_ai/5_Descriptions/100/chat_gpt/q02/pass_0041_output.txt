NO.

The image provided shows vehicles stopped and positioned in a way that suggests they are on a straight section of the road. The visible lane markings and the stance of both vehicles do not indicate the presence of a curve. Additionally, the angle at which the vehicles are following each other suggests a stop due to traffic or a traffic control device such as a light or stop sign, rather than navigation through a sharp curve.
