The image shows a road with a lane marking that indicates a turn ahead, but the visible portion of the road does not have a sharp curve; rather, it only suggests a direction where the road might be curving. The perspective is limited, and we cannot determine the degree of the curve beyond this frame. However, the immediate section of the road visible in the image is not a sharp curve.
