NO.

The image provided is very dark and lacks clear details, but the visible portion of the road does not show signs of a sharp curve. The road appears to go mostly straight ahead with no evident sharp turns within the limited scope of the image. Without better illumination or a wider field of view, it isn't possible to confirm if there are any curves beyond what is shown.
