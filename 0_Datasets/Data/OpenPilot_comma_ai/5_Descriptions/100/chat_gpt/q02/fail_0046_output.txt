NO

Based on the provided image, I cannot definitively determine the shape of the road or whether it is on a sharp curve because the image does not show a clear, extended view of the road. It appears to be a partial view of a surface that could be a road, but without more context or a broader view, it is not possible to assess the curvature of the road accurately.
