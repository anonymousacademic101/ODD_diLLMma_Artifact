The image is blurred, but there appears to be a marked curvature in the painted lines on the road, which typically indicates a sharp turn or curve in the road ahead. The road markings are designed to alert drivers to upcoming changes in the direction of the road, so the presence and arc of these markings can be taken as evidence that there is indeed a sharp curve.
