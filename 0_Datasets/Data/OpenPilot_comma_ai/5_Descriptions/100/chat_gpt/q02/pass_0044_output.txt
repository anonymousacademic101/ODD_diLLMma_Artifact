NO.

The road appears to be curving gently to the right rather than presenting a sharp curve. The lane markings guide the path clearly and there is no immediate, drastic change in direction that would classify it as a sharp curve. The flow of traffic seems smooth and the other vehicles are maintaining their lanes without the need for sharp turns.
