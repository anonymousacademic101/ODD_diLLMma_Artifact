The image is too blurred and cropped to ascertain the curvature of the road with certainty. However, the visible section of the road appears relatively straight in the immediate foreground, without evidence of a sharp curve. The double yellow line also seems to continue in a straight path from the left of the image towards the right, suggesting no immediate sharp curve.
