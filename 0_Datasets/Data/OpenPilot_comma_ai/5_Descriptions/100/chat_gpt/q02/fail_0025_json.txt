The lights and shapes within the image suggest a turn or a bend, but the exact sharpness of the curve cannot be determined definitively due to the lack of clarity in the image. Therefore, without clear visual indicators such as road signs, markings, or an obvious change in the road's direction, it's not possible to confirm if the road is on a sharp curve."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
