Sorry, but it seems there's been a misunderstanding. The image you've provided does not show a road, road signs, traffic, pedestrians, or any environmental cues related to the time of day. Instead, it appears to be a dark and somewhat blurry image taken indoors, possibly of some equipment or miscellaneous items. I cannot provide any detailed factual information regarding driving or road structure as it does not pertain to this image. If you have another image or a different question, feel free to ask!
