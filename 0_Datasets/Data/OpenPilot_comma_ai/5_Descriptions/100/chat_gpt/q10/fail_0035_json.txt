There is a white van parked on the right side just beyond the "KEEP CLEAR" zone, and another red vehicle is visible ahead of the van.\n\nOn the left side, several parked cars are visible along the kerb. There is also a pedestrian on the sidewalk to the far left of the image. The road itself appears to be dry, suggesting the weather at the time the photo was taken might have been clear.\n\nGiven the shadows and the brightness of the scene, it appears to be daytime, but the exact time of day cannot be determined from this image. There are no visible traffic lights or road signs that provide additional instructions or information about the road conditions ahead.\n\nDrivers in this area would need to be mindful of the "KEEP CLEAR" area to not obstruct traffic flows, be aware of potential pedestrians, especially when turning or when pedestrians might be crossing, and adhere to any parking regulations based on the presence of parked vehicles along the side of the road.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
