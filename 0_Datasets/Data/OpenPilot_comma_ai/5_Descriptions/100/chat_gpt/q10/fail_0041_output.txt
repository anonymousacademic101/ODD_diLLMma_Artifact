It appears there's been a mistake, as the image provided does not show any roads, road signs, traffic, pedestrians, or any indicators of the time of day. Instead, the image appears quite dark and possibly depicts an indoor scene with low lighting. What's visible is some kind of room with miscellaneous objects. There is a brightly lit object on the wall, which might be some kind of light fixture or reflection. Unfortunately, due to the darkness and quality of the image, specific details are not clear, and it wouldn't be accurate to make further assumptions about the content without additional context or a clearer image.
