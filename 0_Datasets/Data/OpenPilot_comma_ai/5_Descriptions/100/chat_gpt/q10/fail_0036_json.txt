There is a zebra crossing in the foreground with four broad white stripes that allow pedestrians to cross the road safely. Parallel parked vehicles are visible on both sides of the street, leaving a two-lane road for vehicles to travel in opposite directions. There are no visible road signs, traffic lights, or pedestrians in the immediate sight.\n\nNo moving vehicles are shown in this cropped image, so it is unclear whether there is any vehicular traffic at the moment. There are no distinct shadows that could be used to indicate the precise time of day, but the low-light environment suggests it is either evening or night. While driving in such conditions, one would need to pay close attention to potential pedestrians that might enter the crosswalk, the parked cars (in case someone is about to pull out), and maintaining an appropriate speed for the conditions and visibility.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
