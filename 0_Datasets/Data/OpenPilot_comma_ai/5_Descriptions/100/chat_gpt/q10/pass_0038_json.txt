The road is marked with double solid yellow lines, indicating a no-passing zone for vehicles in both directions. There's also a solid white line along the edge of the road which typically signifies the boundary of the travel lane.\n\nTo the right of the road, there is a sidewalk with what appears to be a guardrail or fence, suggesting that there might be a drop-off or that pedestrians are protected from the adjacent road. The road itself curves gently to the left in the distance.\n\nThere are no visible road signs giving additional instructions or information. The traffic is light, with only a few vehicles visible in the distance. There are no visible pedestrians on the sidewalk.\n\nFor safe driving, one should adhere to the speed limit, stay within the lane, especially due to the double yellow lines indicating a no-passing zone, and be aware of the road conditions ahead, including any potential changes in direction or road curvature. The lighting suggests that the driver should also ensure their headlights are on if this is during dawn or dusk to increase visibility."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
