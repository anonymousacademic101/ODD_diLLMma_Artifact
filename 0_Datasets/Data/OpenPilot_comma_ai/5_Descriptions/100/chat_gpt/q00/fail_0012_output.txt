The image is very dark and unclear, but it does not directly show any evidence of poor visibility due to heavy rain, snow, fog, or adverse weather conditions. The lack of clarity seems to be due to the image's low quality, underexposure, or possibly the camera being obscured, rather than weather conditions.
