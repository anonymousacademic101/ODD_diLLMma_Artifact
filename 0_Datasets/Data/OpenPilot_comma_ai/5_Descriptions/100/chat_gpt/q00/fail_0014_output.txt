NO.

The image does not appear to have poor visibility due to heavy rain, snow, fog, or adverse weather conditions. The blurriness and lack of clarity in the image seem to be the result of motion blur or a low shutter speed used during the taking of the photograph, rather than any weather-related visibility issues.
