The image appears to be taken at night with low visibility conditions, which may not necessarily be due to adverse weather like heavy rain, snow, or fog, but the darkness itself significantly reduces visibility. The photo doesnâ€™t provide clear evidence of adverse weather, but it does show poor visibility due to the nighttime conditions.
