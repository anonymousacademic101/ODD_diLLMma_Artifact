The image appears to be taken in low-light conditions, and the overall scenery is very dark, which creates difficulty in discerning details. There seems to be a lack of clarity or a grainy texture that might indicate mist, fog, or another type of light adverse weather condition reducing visibility. However, the absence of clear weather elements such as raindrops, snowflakes, or heavy fog patterns makes it challenging to definitively ascertain the presence of adverse weather solely based on this image.
