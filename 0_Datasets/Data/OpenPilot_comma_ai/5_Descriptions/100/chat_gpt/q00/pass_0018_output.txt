The image appears to be taken at night, which naturally reduces visibility, but there is no clear evidence of heavy rain, snow, fog, or specific adverse weather conditions obscuring the view. The road and nearby vehicles can still be seen clearly, and there are no telltale signs of weather disturbances such as precipitation or fog clouds.
