The image provided appears to be blurry and lacks clarity, which might suggest poor visibility. However, the lack of sharpness in the image seems to be due to a focus issue or camera movement rather than adverse weather conditions. Thus, the poor visibility in the image is more likely a result of a camera-related problem and not heavy rain, snow, fog, or other adverse weather conditions.
