The image provided does not explicitly show heavy rain, snow, fog, or adverse weather conditions leading to poor visibility. Rather, it depicts a low-light situation, possibly at night, where the visibility may be reduced due to darkness. The surface appears wet or icy, creating reflections, but this does not necessarily indicate poor visibility due to weather conditions. The lack of contextual information, such as falling rain or snow, foggy surroundings, or other indicators of adverse weather conditions, leads to the conclusion that the image does not definitively show poor visibility caused by such conditions.
