NO.

The image is dark and visibility is poor, but this does not appear to be due to weather conditions such as heavy rain, snow, or fog. Instead, it seems to be a result of low lighting conditions in the environment pictured. Visibility issues here are more likely due to insufficient artificial lighting or it being taken during nighttime without adequate lighting.
