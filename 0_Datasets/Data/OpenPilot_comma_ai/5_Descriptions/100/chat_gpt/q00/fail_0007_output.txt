The quality of the image is low, causing it to appear grainy and poorly defined. However, this does not seem to result from poor visibility due to weather conditions such as rain, snow, or fog, but rather from technical issues related to the image capture process or subsequent processing. There are no visible elements in the image that indicate adverse weather conditions. Instead, the lack of clarity is likely due to pixelation or low resolution.
