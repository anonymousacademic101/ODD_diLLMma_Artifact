The image appears to be taken at night or in low-light conditions, which can naturally make visibility poor. However, there is no clear indication of heavy rain, snow, fog, or other specific adverse weather conditions reducing visibility in this image. It lacks the visual cues typically associated with such conditions, like precipitation, snowflakes, or a foggy atmosphere. The darkness itself is due to the time of day or lighting conditions rather than weather.
