NO

The poor visibility in the image is mainly due to its low quality, blurriness, and probably low light conditions; it does not seem to be directly caused by heavy rain, snow, fog, or adverse weather conditions. The image appears to be unclear because of the camera's performance or settings rather than weather-related factors.
