The image does not exhibit clear signs of poor visibility due to heavy rain, snow, fog, or other adverse weather conditions. The road and lane markings are visible, and there are no visible precipitation or haze that would indicate such conditions. However, it is a low-light situation due to it being nighttime or in a poorly lit area. Visibility appears limited primarily due to the darkness rather than weather.
