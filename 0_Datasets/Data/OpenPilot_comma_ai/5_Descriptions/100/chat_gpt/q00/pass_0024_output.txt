NO

The image appears to be taken at night which inherently reduces visibility; however, there are no obvious indicators of heavy rain, snow, fog, or other specific adverse weather conditions reducing visibility further. The road is visible and the lane markings are clear. There's no visible precipitation or mist that would imply poor visibility due to weather conditions.
