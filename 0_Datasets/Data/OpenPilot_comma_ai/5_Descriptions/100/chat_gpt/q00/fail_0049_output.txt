The reasons for the poor visibility in the image are not due to weather conditions such as heavy rain, snow, or fog. The image instead appears to have low resolution, is taken at an odd angle, and might be blurred, suggesting either a poor quality camera was used or the image was taken hastily, perhaps while in motion. These factors can cause poor visibility in an image without the presence of adverse weather conditions.
