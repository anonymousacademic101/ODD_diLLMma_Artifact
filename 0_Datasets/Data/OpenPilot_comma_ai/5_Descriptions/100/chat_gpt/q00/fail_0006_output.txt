The image is dark and underexposed which makes the visibility poor, but there are no visible elements that would necessarily indicate the presence of adverse weather conditions like heavy rain, snow, or fog. The lack of clarity in the image seems to be primarily due to the low light levels rather than weather-related visibility issues.
