The image does not appear to have poor visibility due to heavy rain, snow, fog, or other adverse weather conditions. It simply looks like a low-light or nighttime situation without any visible precipitation or fog that would significantly impede visibility. The tail lights of the vehicle are clear, and no weather-related obscurants can be seen.
