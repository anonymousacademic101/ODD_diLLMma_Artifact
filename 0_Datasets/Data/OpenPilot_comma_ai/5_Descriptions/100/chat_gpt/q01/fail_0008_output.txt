The image appears blurry and lacks clarity, which may suggest motion blur or a focus issue, rather than obstruction by mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products. The lack of streaks, specific blobs, or patterns that would be associated with such substances suggests that the camera lens was not covered or damaged by them. Instead, the blurriness could be a result of a low-quality camera, a fast-moving camera, or an object moving quickly past the camera, causing a blur.
