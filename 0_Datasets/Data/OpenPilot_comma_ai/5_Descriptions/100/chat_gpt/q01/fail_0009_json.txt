There is no clear evidence in the image itself of obstruction, coverage, or damage from mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products on the camera's lens; the blur does not have the characteristics of such obstructions. Instead, the blur appears to be a result of the camera's motion relative to the subject or possibly an out-of-focus shot, rather than an obstruction on the lens."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
