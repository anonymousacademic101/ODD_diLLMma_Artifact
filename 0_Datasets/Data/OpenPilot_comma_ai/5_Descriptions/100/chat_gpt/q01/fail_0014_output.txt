NO

The image appears to be blurry due to motion blur or a low shutter speed used during the capture, rather than the obstruction or damage of the camera lens by mud, ice, snow, or excessive paint or adhesive products. The blurred streaks of light and distortion of static objects suggest that the camera or the photographed subject was moving rapidly relative to each other when the photo was taken. There are no visible signs on the image indicating that an obstruction like mud, ice, snow, or other substances covered the camera lens.
