The photo may be underexposed or taken in low light conditions, resulting in a darker image, but there are no visible obstructions such as smears or residues that one would associate with the camera being compromised by such substances. The clarity of details that are visible in the image (like the vehicle's rear lights and overall shape) also suggest that the lens itself was not obstructed."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
