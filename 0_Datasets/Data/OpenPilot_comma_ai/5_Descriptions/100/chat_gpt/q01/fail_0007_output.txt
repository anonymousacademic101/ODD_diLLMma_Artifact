The quality of the image provided is degraded, suggesting possible digital artifacting, low resolution, or compression effects. There are no visible signs indicating that the camera lens was obstructed, covered, or damaged by mud, ice, snow, or excessive paint or adhesive products. Instead, the distortions seem more consistent with digital anomalies or errors that can occur during image processing, transmission, or when capturing a moving subject at a slow shutter speed.
