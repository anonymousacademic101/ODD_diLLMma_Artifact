The image appears to be dark, possibly taken at night, which might account for the lack of clarity or contrast, but there are no distinct signs of obstruction on the lens itself. The road lines and signs are still visible, indicating that any visibility issues are likely due to lighting conditions rather than obstructions on the camera lens.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
