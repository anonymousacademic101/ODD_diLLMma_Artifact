However, there's no definitive evidence of mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products on the camera lens based on this image alone. The lack of clarity seems to be due to other factors such as camera settings, motion blur, or environmental conditions inside the room rather than an obstruction on the camera."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
