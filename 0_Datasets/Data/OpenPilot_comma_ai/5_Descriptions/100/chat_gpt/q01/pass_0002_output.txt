NO

The image appears to be blurry and possibly taken with motion blur or out of focus, which suggests that the camera was likely not obstructed by mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products. These types of obstructions generally create specific patterns or marks on the image (like smears or solid areas covering parts of the image), which are not present here. Instead, the blurriness is likely due to camera movement, poor focus, or a low-quality camera.
