NO

The image does not indicate that the camera lens was obstructed or damaged by any substances like mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products. The view appears to be relatively clear, showing an unobstructed night scene of a road with vehicle lights and possibly street lights or other light sources in the distance. The darkness and the quality of the image suggest it was taken at night, which might account for the lower visibility, but there's no evidence of obstruction on the lens itself.
