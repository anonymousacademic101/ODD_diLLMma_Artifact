NO

The image provided shows signs of darkness and possibly low resolution or motion blur, but there is no clear evidence of obstruction, covering, or damage by mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products directly on the camera's lens. The visibility issue seems more likely due to low light conditions rather than an obstruction on the camera.
