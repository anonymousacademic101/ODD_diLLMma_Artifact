It looks like the camera was either in motion or the image is out of focus, which can cause blurriness. Additionally, the lighting conditions seem to be contributing to the poor quality of the image, as the light source, possibly the sun, is causing overexposure in part of the photo. There is no visible evidence in the provided image that the camera lens itself was covered or damaged by any of the mentioned substances.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
