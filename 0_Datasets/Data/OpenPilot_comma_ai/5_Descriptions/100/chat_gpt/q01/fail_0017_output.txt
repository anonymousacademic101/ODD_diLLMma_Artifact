The image provided is blurry and of low quality, but that does not necessarily imply that the camera lens was obstructed or covered by substances such as mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products. The lack of sharpness and detail could be the result of motion blur, poor focusing, camera shake, or low resolutionâ€”none of which are related to an obstruction on the camera lens. There are no clear signs of such substances on the camera's lens based on the image provided.
