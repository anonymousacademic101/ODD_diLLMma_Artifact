The camera doesn't seem to be obstructed, covered, or damaged by mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products. The specks and blemishes visible in the image seem to be within the scene itself or possibly on the surface where the image is displayed or printed, rather than on the camera lens or sensor.
