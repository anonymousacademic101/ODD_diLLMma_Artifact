This effect can be due to several factors other than the camera being obstructed, such as motion blur, out-of-focus capture, low light conditions, high ISO noise, or a slow shutter speed being used during the capture. The lack of clear visual evidence of mud, ice, snow, or adhesive substances on the lens itself suggests that the issue is not a result of physical obstruction or damage to the camera.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
