There does not appear to be evidence of obstruction, coverage, or damage by mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products specifically on the camera lens. The distortion looks more like a result of the camera being moved during the exposure or being out of focus rather than an obstruction on the lens.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
