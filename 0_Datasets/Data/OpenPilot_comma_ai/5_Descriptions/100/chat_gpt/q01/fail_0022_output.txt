The reason for any visible distortion or lack of clarity in the image does not appear to be due to the camera being obstructed, covered, or damaged by mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products. The photo quality might be affected by factors such as low lighting, motion blur, camera focus issues, or low resolution, rather than physical obstruction or damage to the camera lens.
