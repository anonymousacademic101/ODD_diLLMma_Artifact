NO.

The poor quality of the image does not necessarily suggest that the camera lens was obstructed by foreign substances like mud, ice, snow, or excessive paint. The blurriness and distortion could be due to motion blur, low lighting, a low-resolution camera, or incorrect focus settings, among other reasons. There's no clear evidence in the image provided that the camera itself was covered or damaged by such materials.
