The reason for the low quality of image does not seem to be due to obstruction, coverage, or damage from mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products. The image looks dark and underexposed, likely due to a misadjustment of the camera's settings or an extreme contrast in lighting conditions, such as driving from a shaded area into a brightly lit area, or vice versa, that the camera could not adjust for quickly enough.
