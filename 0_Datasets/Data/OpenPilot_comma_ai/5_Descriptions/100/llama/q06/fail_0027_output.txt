Yes, there is construction on the road we are driving on. The road is being repaved and there are workers in the process of laying down new asphalt. The workers are wearing hard hats and safety vests, and they are using heavy machinery to lay down the new asphalt. The road is closed to traffic while the construction is taking place, and there are cones and barricades set up to direct traffic around the construction site.</s>
