The image shows a dark and empty street at night. There are no cars or people visible in the image, and the only light comes from the streetlights on either side of the road. The image appears to be taken from the perspective of someone standing on the sidewalk, looking down the street.

The camera that took this image was not obstructed, covered, or damaged by mud, ice, snow, excessive paint or adhesive products. It appears to be a clear and unobstructed view of the street at night.</s>
