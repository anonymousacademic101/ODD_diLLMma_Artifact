This is an image of a street at night. There is a car parked on the side of the road, and a pedestrian walking down the sidewalk. There are streetlights on both sides of the road, casting a bright light on the scene. The sky is dark and cloudy, with a few stars visible in the distance. There are no other vehicles or pedestrians visible in the image. The time of day appears to be around midnight, based on the position of the sun and the shadows cast by the streetlights.</s>
