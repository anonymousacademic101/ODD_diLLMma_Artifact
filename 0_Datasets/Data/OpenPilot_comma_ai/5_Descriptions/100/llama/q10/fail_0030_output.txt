This image shows a street with a building on the left side and a parked car on the right side. The building appears to be an old, abandoned house with broken windows and a crumbling facade. The car is a white sedan with a broken windshield and a flat tire. There are no pedestrians or other vehicles visible in the image. The time of day appears to be late afternoon or early evening, as the shadows are long and the sky is a deep blue. The road appears to be in disrepair, with potholes and cracks visible in the asphalt.</s>
