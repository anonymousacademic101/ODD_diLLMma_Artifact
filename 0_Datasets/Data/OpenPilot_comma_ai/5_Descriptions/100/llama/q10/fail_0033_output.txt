This is an image of a street with a red car parked on the side of the road. There are trees and bushes on either side of the road, and a sidewalk running along the edge of the road. The sky is cloudy and there are no other cars or pedestrians visible in the image. The time of day is difficult to determine from this image, but it appears to be during the day based on the shadows cast by the trees and bushes.</s>
