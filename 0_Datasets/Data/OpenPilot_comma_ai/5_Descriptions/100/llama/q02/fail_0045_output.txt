The image shows a street at night with a car parked on the side of the road. There is a person standing on the sidewalk in front of the car, looking down at something on the ground. The sky is dark and there are streetlights on either side of the road.

Is the road we are driving on a sharp curve?

NO. The road appears to be straight and flat.</s>
