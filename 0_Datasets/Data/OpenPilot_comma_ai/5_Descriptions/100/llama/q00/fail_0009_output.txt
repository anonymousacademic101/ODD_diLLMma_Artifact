Yes, the image has poor visibility due to heavy rain. The car is driving through the rain, and the windshield wipers are on to clear the water from the windshield. The road is wet and slippery, and the car's tires are hydroplaning. The image is taken from a low angle, which makes it difficult to see the details of the car and the road.</s>
