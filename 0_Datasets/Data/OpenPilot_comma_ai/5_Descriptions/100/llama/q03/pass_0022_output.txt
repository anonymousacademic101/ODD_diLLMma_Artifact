The image shows a dark road with headlights on both sides. There are no other cars or pedestrians visible in the image.

The answer to your question is NO, the road is not an on-off ramp. The headlights on both sides of the road indicate that it is a two-way road, and there is no indication of an on-off ramp.</s>
