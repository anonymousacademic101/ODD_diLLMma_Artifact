The image is of a street at night with no cars or people in sight. The sky is clear and the stars are visible in the sky. There are no streetlights on the road, but the headlights of oncoming cars can be seen in the distance. The image is taken from the perspective of someone standing on the sidewalk, looking down the street.</s>
