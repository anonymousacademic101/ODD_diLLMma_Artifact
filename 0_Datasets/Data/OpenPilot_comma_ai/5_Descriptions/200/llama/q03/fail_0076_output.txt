This is an image of a street at night with cars parked along the side of the road. There are no pedestrians or other vehicles visible in the image.

The road appears to be an on-off ramp, as there are two lanes of traffic going in opposite directions. The left lane appears to be an on-ramp, while the right lane appears to be an off-ramp. There are no signs or markings visible in the image to indicate whether the road is an on-off ramp or not.</s>
