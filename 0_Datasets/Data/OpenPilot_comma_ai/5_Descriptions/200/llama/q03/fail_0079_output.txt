The image shows a dark and empty street at night with streetlights on both sides of the road. There are no cars or pedestrians visible in the image.

Is the road we are driving on an on-off ramp?

NO, the road is not an on-off ramp. It appears to be a regular street with streetlights on both sides.</s>
