The image shows a road that appears to be an on-off ramp. The road is divided into two lanes, with one lane leading to an on-ramp and the other lane leading to an off-ramp. The on-ramp is marked with a sign that reads "On-Ramp" and the off-ramp is marked with a sign that reads "Off-Ramp". The image is taken from the perspective of someone driving on the road, looking towards the on-ramp.</s>
