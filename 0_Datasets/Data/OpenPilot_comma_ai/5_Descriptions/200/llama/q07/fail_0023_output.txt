The image shows a dark and empty room with a window on the left side. There is no light coming from the window, and the only light in the room comes from a small lamp on the right side of the room. The lamp is turned off, and there is no other light source in the room. The image is taken at night, and there is no direct sunlight entering the camera. Therefore, the answer to the question is NO.</s>
