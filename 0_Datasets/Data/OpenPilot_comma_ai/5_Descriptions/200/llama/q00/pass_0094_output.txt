Yes, the image has poor visibility due to the heavy rain. The street is empty and there are no cars parked on the side of the road. The buildings on either side of the street are dark and there are no lights on in any of them. The image is taken at night and the lack of lighting makes it difficult to see the details of the scene.</s>
