Yes, the image has poor visibility due to heavy rain. The road is wet and there are puddles of water on it, making it difficult to see what is in front of the car. The headlights of the car are on, but they are not illuminating the road very well due to the rain. The car is parked on the side of the road, and there are no other vehicles or pedestrians visible in the image.</s>
