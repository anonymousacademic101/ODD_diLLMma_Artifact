Yes, the image has poor visibility due to heavy rain. The cars on the road are driving slowly and cautiously, and there are pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The sky is overcast and there are puddles of water on the road. The image is taken from a low angle, which makes it difficult to see the details of the cars and pedestrians. The lighting is also poor, which makes it difficult to see the colors of the cars and the pedestrians' clothing.</s>
