Yes, the image has poor visibility due to the heavy rain. The car is parked on the side of the road, with its headlights shining brightly in the darkness. The road is wet and slippery, and the car's tires are spinning as it tries to make its way through the puddles. The image is taken at night, and the only light comes from the headlights of the car and the streetlights in the distance.</s>
