Yes, the image has poor visibility due to heavy rain. The car is driving on the road with its headlights on, but the rain is making it difficult to see the road ahead. The windshield wipers are on, but they are not doing a good job of clearing the water from the windshield. The rain is also making it difficult to see other cars and pedestrians on the road.</s>
