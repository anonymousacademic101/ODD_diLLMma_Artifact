The image is of a street with a stop sign on the corner. The sign is white with the words "stop" written in black letters. The road is empty and there are no other cars or pedestrians in sight. The sky is cloudy and there is no sunlight visible. Therefore, the visibility is poor due to heavy rain, snow, fog, or adverse weather conditions.</s>
