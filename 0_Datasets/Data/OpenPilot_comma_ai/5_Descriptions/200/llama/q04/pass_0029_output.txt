The image shows a street at night with streetlights on both sides of the road. There is a parked car on the left side of the road, and a building with windows on the right side of the road. The road is empty and there are no pedestrians or other vehicles visible in the image.

Is the road we are driving on an intersection, or does it run horizontally across the image?

NO, the road does not run horizontally across the image. It is a straight road with streetlights on both sides.</s>
