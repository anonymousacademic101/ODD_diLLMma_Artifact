The image is a dark and dimly lit street at night. There is a car parked on the side of the road, and the headlights of the car are shining on the ground. The road appears to be made of asphalt, and there are no other vehicles or pedestrians visible in the image. The sky is dark and cloudy, and there are no streetlights or other sources of light visible in the image. Therefore, the road is not an intersection, but rather a straight stretch of road that runs horizontally across the image.</s>
