The image shows a street at night with streetlights on both sides of the road. There is a car parked on the left side of the road, and a pedestrian walking on the right side of the road. The sky is dark and there are stars visible in the sky.

The answer to your question is NO, the road is not a sharp curve. The road appears to be a straight, two-lane road with streetlights on both sides. The car parked on the left side of the road is facing the opposite direction of the pedestrian walking on the right side of the road. The sky is dark and there are stars visible in the sky, indicating that it is nighttime.</s>
