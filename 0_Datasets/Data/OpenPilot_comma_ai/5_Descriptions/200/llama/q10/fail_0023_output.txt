There are no other vehicles or pedestrians visible in the image. The time of day appears to be late at night or early in the morning, based on the position of the sun and the shadows cast by the buildings and trees. The road appears to be in good condition, with no potholes or other damage visible. The buildings on either side of the road are dark and appear to be made of brick or stone. There are no streetlights visible in the image, but the headlights of the car provide enough light to see the road and surrounding area.</s>
