This is an image of a dark alleyway at night. There are several parked cars on the side of the road, and a few pedestrians can be seen walking down the sidewalk. The streetlights are on, casting a dim glow over the area. The buildings on either side of the road are dark and appear to be made of brick or stone. There are no other cars or pedestrians visible in the image. The time of day appears to be around midnight, based on the position of the stars in the sky.</s>
