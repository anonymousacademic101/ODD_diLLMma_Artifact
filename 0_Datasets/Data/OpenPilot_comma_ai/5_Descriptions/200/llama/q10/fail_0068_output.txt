This is an image of a street with a construction site on the left side of the road. There is a large pile of dirt and debris in the middle of the road, and a sign on the right side of the road that says "construction zone." There are also several cars parked on the side of the road, and pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The time of day is likely early morning or late afternoon, as there are no other cars or pedestrians visible in the image.</s>
