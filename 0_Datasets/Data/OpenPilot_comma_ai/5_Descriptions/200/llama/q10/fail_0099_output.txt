This image shows a car parked on the side of the road in front of a building. The car is a silver hatchback with tinted windows and a bumper sticker on the rear windshield. The building appears to be a multi-story apartment complex with balconies on the upper floors. There are no pedestrians or other vehicles visible in the image. The time of day appears to be late morning or early afternoon, as the sun is shining and there are shadows on the ground. The road appears to be well-maintained and free of debris.</s>
