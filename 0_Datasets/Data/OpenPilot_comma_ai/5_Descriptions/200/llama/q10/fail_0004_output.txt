This is an image of a street scene with a car parked on the side of the road. The car is a white sedan with tinted windows and a bumper sticker on the rear windshield. There is a stop sign on the corner of the intersection, and a pedestrian is walking in the crosswalk. The sky is cloudy and there are trees on both sides of the road. The time of day is likely early morning or late afternoon, as there are no other cars on the road and the sun is low in the sky.</s>
