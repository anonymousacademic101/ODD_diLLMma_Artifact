This image shows a construction site with several orange cones lined up along the side of the road. There are also several workers in hard hats and reflective vests standing around the site, directing traffic and working on the construction. The time of day appears to be early morning or late evening, as there are no other cars or pedestrians visible in the image. The sky is overcast, with a few clouds visible in the distance. The building in the background appears to be under construction, with scaffolding and construction materials visible on the roof and sides.</s>
