This image shows a construction site with a large pile of debris on the side of the road. The debris appears to be from the demolition of a building, as there are pieces of concrete, bricks, and other materials scattered around. The road is empty and there are no cars or pedestrians in sight. The time of day appears to be early morning or late afternoon, as the sun is shining and there are shadows on the ground. The sky is clear and there are no clouds in sight. The image is taken from the perspective of someone standing on the sidewalk, looking towards the construction site.</s>
