The road appears to be hilly based on the angle of the crosswalk lines and how they relate to the horizon line, which suggests that the road is sloping upward or downward. Additionally, the vehicles in the distance seem to be positioned at an angle that is typical for roads that are not flat, further supporting the observation that the road is hilly.
