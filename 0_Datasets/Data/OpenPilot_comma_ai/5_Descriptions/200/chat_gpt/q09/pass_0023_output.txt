NO.

The view presented in the image does not appear to be a road that is actively being driven on; it seems to be a parking lot with marked parking spaces and a curb in the foreground. There is no visible hill on the section of the parking surface that is shown in the image, as it appears to be generally flat based on the layout of the parking spaces and the stripes on the ground. Also, the context you provided ("the road we are driving on") does not match the content of the image, which shows a stationary view without any movement or indications of active driving.
