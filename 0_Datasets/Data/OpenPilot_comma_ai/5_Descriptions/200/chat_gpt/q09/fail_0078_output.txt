From the image provided, the road appears flat with no visible inclines or declines that would indicate a hilly terrain. The sightline is straight and horizontal, without any undulations that one would expect in a hilly area. However, without panoramic visibility or further context beyond this snapshot, it is difficult to definitively assess the topography of the surrounding area.
