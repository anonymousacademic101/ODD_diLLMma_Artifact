The lighting in the image is quite limited, but based on the visible contours of the road, there appears to be a slight slope upward in the distance, as indicated by the angle of the headlights and the way the parked cars' positions change relative to the horizon. The gradient is not steep, but it does suggest some degree of hilliness.
