The photo seems to depict a road with no distinct hills visible in the immediate vicinity of the perspective shown. The road appears relatively flat at the point from which the image is taken. However, the quality and scope of the image are limited, and it's difficult to ascertain the full topography of the area beyond what can be seen directly.
