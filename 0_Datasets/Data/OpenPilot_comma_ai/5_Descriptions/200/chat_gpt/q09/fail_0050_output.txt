The image is blurry and taken at night which makes it difficult to make out the details of the terrain. However, there appears to be a slight incline in the illumination on the right side of the road, which suggests that the road might be going uphill at that point. But without more context or a clearer image, this observation cannot be asserted with strong confidence.
