NO.

The image provided is too blurred and dark to clearly discern the topography of the road. There are no visual cues that would allow me to confirm the presence of hills, such as changes in the elevation or the inclination of the road's surface. Therefore, I cannot accurately state that the road is hilly based on this image.
