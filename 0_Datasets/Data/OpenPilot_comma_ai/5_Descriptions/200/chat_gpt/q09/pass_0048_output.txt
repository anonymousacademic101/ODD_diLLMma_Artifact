NO.

From the visible portion of the road in the image, it appears relatively flat without significant inclines or declines that would indicate a hilly terrain. The road seems to be evenly illuminated by streetlights or vehicle lights, and there are no visible slopes or curves that typically characterize a hilly road. However, I must note that due to the darkness and the limited field of view, I cannot conclusively determine the entire road's gradient beyond what is visible.
