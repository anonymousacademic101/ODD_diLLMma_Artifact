NO

The image provided does not contain enough information to assess the condition of the road in terms of it being hilly or not. It is a cropped, blurry image focused on what appears to be a portion of a vehicle window or structure, making it impossible to determine the topography of the road. Therefore, I cannot confirm whether the road is hilly based on this image.
