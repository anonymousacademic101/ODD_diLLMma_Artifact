The lighting and clarity of the image are quite limited, but the perspective of the road ahead shows a visible incline which suggests that the road is hilly. The way the headlights illuminate the path seems to reveal an upward slope, as the light does not extend far horizontally but rather diminishes as it shines up the incline.
