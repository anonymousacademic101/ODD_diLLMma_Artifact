YES.

The image shows vehicles at a tilted angle relative to the bottom frame of the picture, which suggests they are driving on an incline. Although the image resolution is low, it is evident that the camera angle is fairly level with respect to the vehicles, indicating that the tilted appearance of the vehicles is due to the road being hilly or sloped rather than the camera being tilted.
