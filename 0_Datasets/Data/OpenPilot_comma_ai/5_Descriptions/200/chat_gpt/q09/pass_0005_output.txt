NO.

The image provided does not give any evidence of a hilly terrain. We only see a car directly ahead, and the perspective does not allow us to assess the incline or decline of the road. Without visual cues indicating elevation changes, such as horizon lines, slope, or the angle of the vehicle in front relative to a level baseline, we cannot confirm that the road is hilly.
