The image provided appears to be taken at an angle that makes the driveway look steep. However, without a wider view or additional context, it's not possible to accurately assess the overall topography of the road beyond this specific section. The visual information is too limited to confirm if the entire road is hilly or if this is just a steep section such as a driveway.
