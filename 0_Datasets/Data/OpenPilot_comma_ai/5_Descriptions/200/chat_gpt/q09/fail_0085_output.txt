The image provided is of poor quality and shows a very limited view of the road, primarily focusing on the surface which appears to be flat. However, due to the darkness and low resolution, it's difficult to determine if the road is hilly beyond the visible area. The absence of any visible inclines or slopes in the portion shown suggests that at least in this section, the road is not hilly.
