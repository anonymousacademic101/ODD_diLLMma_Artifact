The road in the image appears relatively flat, without significant inclines or declines that would indicate it is hilly. The vehicles are parked along the side of the road without any apparent angle that you would expect on a hilly street. The shadows and lighting are consistent across the road, suggesting there are no slopes causing variations in shadow length.
