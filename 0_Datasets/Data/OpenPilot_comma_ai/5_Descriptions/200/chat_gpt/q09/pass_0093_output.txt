The visible section of the road in the image appears flat, without any significant inclines, declines, or hills. However, itâ€™s worth noting that the field of view is limited; we cannot see far enough into the distance to determine the topography beyond the immediate foreground. The road ahead may or may not become hilly beyond what is visible.
