YES

The image provided has a section where there is a very bright white light, which could be interpreted as a strong light source heading into the camera. This could be from direct sunlight reflecting off a surface or a similar intensely bright light source. The light appears to be overexposed in the photograph, which is why it is perceived as "extremely bright."
