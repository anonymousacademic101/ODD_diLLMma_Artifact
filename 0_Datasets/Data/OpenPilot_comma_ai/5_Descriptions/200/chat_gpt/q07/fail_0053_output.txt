The image is generally dark, and there do not appear to be any extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight in the camera's view. The photo seems to be captured at night, and while there might be some small light sources or reflections visible, they are neither prominent nor producing significant glare that would indicate extremely bright lights or sunlight.
