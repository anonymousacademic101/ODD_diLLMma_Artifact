The image does not show any extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights, nor is there any indication of direct sunlight into the camera that would cause glare or a washed-out effect. The lighting appears even and there are visible shadows on the road, indicating the sun is higher in the sky or possibly obscured by clouds, but it is not shining directly into the camera lens.
