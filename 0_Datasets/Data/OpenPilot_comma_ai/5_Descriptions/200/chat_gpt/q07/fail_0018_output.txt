NO

The image is blurry, and the overexposure that is typically associated with extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight is not evident. The conditions you've described generally result in areas of the image being washed out or flaring, which doesn't appear to be the case here. The blurriness seems more related to motion or a low-quality camera rather than extreme brightness.
