NO.

The image presented appears to be taken at night with low light conditions. While there are some light sources visible, none of them seem to be extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight into the camera. The lights do not overpower the scene or cause significant lens flare that would indicate extreme brightness.
