NO

The image shows a dark road at nighttime without any extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights, and obviously there is no sunlight as it is not daytime. The road is dimly lit by what appears to be ambient light, possibly from roadside lighting or the vehicle's headlights that captured the image. There is some glare on the road, but it is not extremely bright and does not seem to be affecting the camera's exposure significantly.
