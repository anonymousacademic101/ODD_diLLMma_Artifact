The image shows a nighttime scene without any extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight. There are some sources of light in the distance, which appear to be illuminated markers or possibly other vehicles, but they do not produce an extreme brightness that would significantly impact visibility for a camera or a person's eyesight. The overall scene is relatively dark, consistent with what one would expect in a low-light driving situation.
