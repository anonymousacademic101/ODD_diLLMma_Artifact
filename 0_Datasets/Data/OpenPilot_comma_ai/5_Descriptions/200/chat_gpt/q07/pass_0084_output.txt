The image appears to be taken during twilight or early evening, indicated by the low ambient light. The car's tail lights are on, but they do not produce an extremely bright light that would cause glare or difficulty seeing. There is no direct sunlight coming into the camera, and no headlights from oncoming traffic are visible in this view. The overall lighting in the photo is dim without any harsh light sources.
