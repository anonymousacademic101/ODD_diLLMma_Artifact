The image appears to show a very bright light at the end of the street, which could be due to oncoming headlights or another bright light source. It is not necessarily direct sunlight, as it's not possible to confirm the time of day with certainty, but the intensity of the light compared to the surrounding area suggests a strong light source facing the camera.
