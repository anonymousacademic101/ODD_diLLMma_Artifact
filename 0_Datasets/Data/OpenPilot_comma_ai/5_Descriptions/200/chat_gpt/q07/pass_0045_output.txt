YES

There are several points of bright light in the image which appear to be oncoming headlights from vehicles in the distance. These lights are quite bright compared to the surrounding darkness, indicating they could be considered "extremely bright" in the context of the photo, as they stand out prominently. There is no direct sunlight visible, as it seems to be nighttime.
