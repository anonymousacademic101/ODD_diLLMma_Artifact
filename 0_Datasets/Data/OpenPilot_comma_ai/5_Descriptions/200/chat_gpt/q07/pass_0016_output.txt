NO.

The image appears to be taken at night, and while there are multiple sources of light visible, none are extremely bright to the point of causing significant glare or overexposure in the camera's sensor. There are no signs of direct sunlight, as it is nighttime, and the oncoming headlights, while visible, are not overpowering in the image.
