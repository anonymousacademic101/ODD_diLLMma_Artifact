The image appears to be taken at night with very low ambient light, making the environment seem quite dark. There are no visible sources of extremely bright light such as oncoming headlights or direct sunlight evident in the image. The scene is underexposed, which suggests limited light availability and no bright light sources shining directly into the camera.
