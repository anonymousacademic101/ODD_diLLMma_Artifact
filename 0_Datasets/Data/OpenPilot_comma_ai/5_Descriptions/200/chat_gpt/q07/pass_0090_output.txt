NO

Although there are several sources of light visible in the image, none of them appear extremely bright or cause a glare that would significantly impair visibility. The lights seem to be standard vehicle headlights and street lights, with none directly shining into the camera or exhibiting an intensity that could be described as "extremely bright."
