NO

Although there are lights visible from vehicles in the distance, they are not extremely bright, nor do they appear to be causing significant glare or overexposure in the camera. The scene seems to be captured at night with ambient lighting conditions that are consistent with nighttime driving, without direct sunlight or excessively bright headlight beams directly into the camera lens.
