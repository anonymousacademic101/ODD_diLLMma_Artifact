NO.

The image is too dark to clearly identify any sources of light. There appear to be some minor light reflections or small light sources in the background, but they do not resemble extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight. The general quality of the image suggests low light conditions without significant glare or bright light sources directed at the camera.
