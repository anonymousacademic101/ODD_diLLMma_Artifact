The image appears to show a road during a time of day when the sky is bright but not overly so, and there are no glaring or extremely bright lights from oncoming traffic or direct sunlight visible in the picture. The lighting looks even and there is no sign of lens flare or headlight glare that would indicate extremely bright lights.
