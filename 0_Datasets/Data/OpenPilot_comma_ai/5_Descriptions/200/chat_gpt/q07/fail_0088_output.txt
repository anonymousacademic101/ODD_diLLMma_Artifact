The image shows multiple light sources that are relatively bright compared to their surroundings. There are light sources in the distance that could be coming from oncoming vehicles, which appear bright against the darker background. Additionally, the street light (seen overhead) and various illuminated signs are producing bright light which is captured by the camera. There is no direct sunlight, as it appears to be nighttime, but the brightness of the artificial lights mimics a glare effect that could come from direct sunlight or high-beam headlights.
