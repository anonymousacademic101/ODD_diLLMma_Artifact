NO.

The image is showing a nighttime scene, hence there can be no direct sunlight. Additionally, while there are lights visible in the distance and possible reflections on the road, none appear to be extremely bright or directly shining into the camera lens to the point of causing significant glare or visibility issues typical of oncoming headlights. The lights are not overpowering the camera's exposure or creating a blinding effect in this image.
