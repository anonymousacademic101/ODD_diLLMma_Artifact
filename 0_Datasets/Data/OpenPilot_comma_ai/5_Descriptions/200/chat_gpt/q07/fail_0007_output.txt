NO.

The image shows a parking lot with multiple parked cars, and it is daytime with shadows visible on the ground, suggesting the presence of sunlight but not directly into the camera. There does not appear to be any glare or extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights in this picture. The lighting condition seems even, without any harsh lights affecting the visibility.
