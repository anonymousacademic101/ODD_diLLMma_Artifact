The lights from the oncoming headlights are visible, but they do not appear to be extremely bright or overwhelming in the image. There is no sign of direct sunlight as the setting appears to be during nighttime, thus the ambient light is low, and the headlights are not causing significant glare or lens flare in the camera.
