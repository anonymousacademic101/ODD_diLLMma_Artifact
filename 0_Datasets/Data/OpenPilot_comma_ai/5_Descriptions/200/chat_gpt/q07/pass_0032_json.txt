These lights can be considered extremely bright relative to the surrounding darkness. Their brightness is enhanced due to the low-light conditions which cause the camera to capture the headlights as bright spots. Some of these lights appear to have a high intensity, indicating that they might be high beams or poorly adjusted headlights that can be blinding in real-life conditions."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
