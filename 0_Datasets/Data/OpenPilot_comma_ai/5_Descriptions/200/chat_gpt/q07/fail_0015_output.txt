The picture shows a rear view of a Toyota Prius in daylight without any extremely bright lights or glare from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight affecting the camera's view. The lighting in the image is even and does not show signs of overexposure that would be indicative of bright lights shining directly into the lens.
