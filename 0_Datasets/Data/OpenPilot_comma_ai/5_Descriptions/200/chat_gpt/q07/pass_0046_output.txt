The image appears to be taken at night with moderate lighting. There are some headlights visible in the distance, but they are not extremely bright nor do they appear to be causing glare directly into the camera. The overall scene is relatively dim and lacks the intensity or overexposure often associated with extremely bright lights or direct sunlight.
