NO.

The image appears to have some areas with strong shadows and bright sunlight on the ground, which suggests a sunny day, but there are no extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight glaring into the camera causing lens flare or significantly overexposed areas in this specific image. The brightness seems within a manageable range for the camera, without any harsh glare from artificial or natural light sources directly facing the lens.
