NO

There are headlights visible from oncoming traffic and cars in the same direction, typical of a night scene on a busy road, but they do not appear to be extremely bright or causing significant glare into the camera. The lighting is consistent with what one might expect under these conditions and does not appear to be overwhelming the camera's sensor or creating issues capturing the scene.
