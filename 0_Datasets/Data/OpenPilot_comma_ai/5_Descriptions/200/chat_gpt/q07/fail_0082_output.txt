NO.

The image appears to be taken in a low-light environment with a single, small light source visible. This light source is not extremely bright, nor does it resemble the intensity you would expect from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight. The ambient light in the scene is quite dim, and the light source appears to be artificial, such as a lamp or small bulb, without causing significant glare or overexposure in the camera.
