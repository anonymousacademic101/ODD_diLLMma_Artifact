The image is taken at nighttime, and while there are multiple sources of light such as street lights and vehicle headlights, none of them appear to be extremely bright or causing significant glare that would impact the visibility of the scene dramatically. The headlights from oncoming traffic are visible but not overwhelmingly bright, and there is no direct sunlight because it is night.
