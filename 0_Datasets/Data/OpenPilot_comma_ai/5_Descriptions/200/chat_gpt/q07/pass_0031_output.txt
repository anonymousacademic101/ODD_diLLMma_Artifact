While there are no extreme cases of lens flare or direct sunlight, the image does show various light sources from oncoming traffic and streetlights at night that are relatively bright compared to the darkness of the surroundings. However, it's not to the extent that would typically be described as "extremely" bright, like high-beam headlights or sunlight directly into the lens, but they are still noticeable bright spots in the image.
