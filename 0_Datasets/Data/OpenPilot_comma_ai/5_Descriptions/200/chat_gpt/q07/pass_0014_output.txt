The image appears to be taken at nighttime with no signs of direct sunlight. While there are lights in the distance possibly from oncoming headlights, they do not appear to be extremely bright or causing significant glare into the camera. The brightness is relatively subdued and does not overwhelm the scene, which suggests that the image is exposed well enough to handle the ambient light from the headlights without causing a glare issue.
