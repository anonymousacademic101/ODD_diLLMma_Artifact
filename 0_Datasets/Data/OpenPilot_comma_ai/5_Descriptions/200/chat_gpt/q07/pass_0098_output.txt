NO

The image shows a street scene with vehicles, but there are no extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight overwhelming the camera's exposure. The lighting appears relatively even, and while there is some glare visible on the vehicles, it does not reach the level of being extremely bright or causing significant lens flare.
