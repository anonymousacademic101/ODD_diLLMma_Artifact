There aren't any extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight into the camera. The scene is dark, and while there is a light source visible, it is not extremely bright nor causing significant glare that would suggest oncoming headlights or direct sunlight. The light observed seems to be from a vehicle's tail lights rather than headlights, indicating it is not facing towards the camera.
