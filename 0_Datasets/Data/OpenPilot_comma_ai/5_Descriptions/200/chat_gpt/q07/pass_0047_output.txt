The image presented is a low-light environment, presumably taken at nighttime, with no signs of extremely bright lights from headlights or direct sunlight visible in the scene. The street is dimly lit, and headlights or bright lights, if present, would generally appear as bright white or yellowish spots or streaks. Direct sunlight would not be a factor at night and would typically create a glare or lens flare effect if it were present during the day.
