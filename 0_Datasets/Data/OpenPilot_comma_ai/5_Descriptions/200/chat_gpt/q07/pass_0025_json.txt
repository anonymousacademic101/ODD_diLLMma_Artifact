This can cause bright light conditions and potential glare for drivers and cameras facing toward the sun. Direct sunlight appears to be entering the camera's field of view from the front, which can result in a very bright light that may affect visibility."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
