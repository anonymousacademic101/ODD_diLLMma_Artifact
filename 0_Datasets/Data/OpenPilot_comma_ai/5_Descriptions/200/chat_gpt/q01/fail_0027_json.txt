If the camera were covered or damaged by such substances, we would typically see more evidence of physical debris or residue on the lens, which isn't apparent here. The details in the image aren't obscured by any foreign material; rather, they are smeared due to the relative motion between the camera and the subject during exposure."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
