NO

The image appears blurry and possibly taken while the camera was in motion, but there is no evidence of obstruction, covering, or damage by mud, ice, snow, excessive paint or adhesive products to the camera itself. The lack of any such residue or obstructions on the image indicates that the camera lens was not compromised by these substances. The blurriness is more likely due to motion or focus issues rather than a dirty or damaged lens.
