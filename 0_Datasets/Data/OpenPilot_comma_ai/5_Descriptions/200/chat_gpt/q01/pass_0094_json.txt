There are no visible signs that the camera lens was obstructed, covered, or damaged by mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products, as none of those would typically result in this type of image quality issue without also leaving identifiable residues or patterns on the image. Instead, the overall uniformity of the darkness and the lack of distinctive obstructions suggest a different cause for the poor image quality.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
