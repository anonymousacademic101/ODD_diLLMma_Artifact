NO

The image appears to be clear of obstructions such as mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products. The visibility is reasonably clear, and the details such as street lights and vehicles are visible, indicating there's no significant coverage over the camera lens that would lead to obstruction of the image. The quality of the image might not be perfect, which could be due to a variety of other reasons such as low lighting, motion, or camera quality, but these do not necessarily indicate that the camera was obstructed or covered.
