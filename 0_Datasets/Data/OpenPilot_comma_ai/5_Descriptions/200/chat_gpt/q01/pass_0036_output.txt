The image has blurriness and distortion consistent with some kind of obstruction on the camera lens. The visibility is significantly impaired, which suggests that the camera lens could have been covered or obscured by a substance like mud, ice, snow, or another material. The exact cause cannot be determined from the image alone, but it is clear that something is affecting the image quality.
