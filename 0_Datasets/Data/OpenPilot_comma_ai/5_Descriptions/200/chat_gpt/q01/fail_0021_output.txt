NO.

The image is not clear and sharp because it seems to be taken in low lighting conditions, possibly at dusk or dawn, or under poor weather conditions. The camera also appears to be of low quality or the settings may not have been optimal for the conditions, resulting in a grainy and somewhat blurry image. There is no visible evidence that the camera was obstructed, covered, or damaged by mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products.
