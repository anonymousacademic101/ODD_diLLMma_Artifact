The image provided is blurry, possibly due to motion blur or being out of focus, which does not necessarily indicate that the camera lens was obstructed or covered by mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products. Obstructions typically have more distinctive patterns or coverage on the image. This blur seems more likely due to camera movement or focus issues rather than an obstruction on the lens.
