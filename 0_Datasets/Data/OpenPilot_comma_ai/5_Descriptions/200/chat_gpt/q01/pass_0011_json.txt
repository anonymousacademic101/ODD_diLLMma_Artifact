The image seems relatively clear with no distortions or markings that would typically indicate such obstructions. Instead, the image looks like a usual low-light or overcast situation, resulting in a darker overall appearance, but without any specific signs of the lens being compromised by the substances mentioned.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
