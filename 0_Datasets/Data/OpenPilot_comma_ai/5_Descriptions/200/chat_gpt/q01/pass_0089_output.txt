The image provided appears to be clear of obstructions such as mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products. The visibility issues seen here are more likely due to the photograph being taken in a low-light environment with movement, causing some motion blur and graininess. There are no clear signs of the categories of obstruction you listed affecting the camera lens directly.
