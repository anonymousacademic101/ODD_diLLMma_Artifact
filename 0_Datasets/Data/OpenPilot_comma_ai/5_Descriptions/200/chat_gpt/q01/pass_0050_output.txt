YES

The quality of the image suggests that the camera lens may have been partially obstructed or the camera settings were not adjusted properly for the conditions. There is a blurred quality and lack of clear detail that could be attributed to smears or obstructions like mud, ice, or other substances on the lens, or possibly a condensation or frost issue if the weather was cold, which can give a similar visual effect. However, this determination is based on the visual evidence available; without more information, it's not possible to say definitively what caused the image quality issue.
