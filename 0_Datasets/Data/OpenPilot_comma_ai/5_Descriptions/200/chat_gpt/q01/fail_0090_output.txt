The image provided is blurry, which generally indicates motion blur or a lack of focus rather than obstruction, coverage, or damage to the camera by substances such as mud, ice, snow, or excessive paint/adhesive products. This blurriness can happen with quick movements, especially in low-light conditions or if the camera's shutter speed was not fast enough to freeze the motion of the car.
