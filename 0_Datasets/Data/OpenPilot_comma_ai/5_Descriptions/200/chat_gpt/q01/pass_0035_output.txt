NO.

The image appears to be affected by a low-light condition or motion blur rather than an obstruction, coverage, or damage such as mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products on the camera's lens. There are no obvious traces of such substances on the image; instead, the blurriness and graininess suggest other causes, such as camera settings not adjusted for the lighting conditions, or movement during the exposure.
