NO.

The image is blurry, which suggests that the blur is the result of camera movement or a slow shutter speed rather than an obstruction over the lens. If the camera had been covered or damaged by substances such as mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products, we would expect to see evidence of these materials in the form of residue or texture on the image. However, the blurriness is uniform and does not show signs of residue, which indicates that the cause is related to how the image was captured rather than an external substance on the lens.
