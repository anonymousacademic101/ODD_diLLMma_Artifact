The blurriness is more likely due to motion blur or camera settings rather than an obstruction or damage like mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products. The rest of the image seems relatively clear and does not exhibit the typical patterns or distortions you would expect if the camera lens were obscured or damaged by such substances.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
