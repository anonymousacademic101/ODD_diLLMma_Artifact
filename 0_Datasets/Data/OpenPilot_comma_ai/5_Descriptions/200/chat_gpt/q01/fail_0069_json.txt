The lack of any such residue or obstructions on the image indicates that the camera lens was not compromised by these substances. The blurriness is more likely due to motion or focus issues rather than a dirty or damaged lens.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
