The lack of visible anomalies that typically result from such substances suggests that the image's quality issues may stem from other factors like low lighting conditions, motion blur, camera settings, or sensor limitations rather than physical obstruction or damage to the camera itself."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
