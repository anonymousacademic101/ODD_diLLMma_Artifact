The image appears to be partially obscured in the upper regions, which could be indicative of something partially covering the camera lens. The patterns and shapes do not resemble common obstructions like mud, ice, snow, or adhesive products, but it is fair to conclude that there might have been something that interfered with the camera's view, causing the image to be partially distorted or obscured.
