YES

The quality of the image presented is poor, and it appears to be obscured. While I cannot assert with complete certainty the cause of the obstruction, it is possible that the image could appear as such if the camera lens was covered or compromised by mud, ice, snow, paint, adhesive products, or any other substance or condition that hinders its ability to capture a clear image. Excessive dirt or moisture is common when there's a significant reduction in image clarity, as demonstrated.
