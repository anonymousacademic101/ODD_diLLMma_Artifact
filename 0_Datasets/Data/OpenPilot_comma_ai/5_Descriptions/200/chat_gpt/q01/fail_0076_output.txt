NO

The image appears to be blurry, out of focus, or taken with a low shutter speed while in motion, rather than being the result of obstruction, covering, or damage by material such as mud, ice, snow, paint, or adhesive products. There are no clear signs of smudging or debris on the lens that would indicate such substances are present. The blurring effect is likely due to camera movement or focus issues.
