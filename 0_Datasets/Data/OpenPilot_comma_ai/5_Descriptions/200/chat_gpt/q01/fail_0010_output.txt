The image is blurry and seems to show signs of motion blur or camera movement rather than obstructions or residues such as mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products on the camera lens itself. The blurriness affects the entire image uniformly rather than showing signs of a partial obstruction or specific damage to the camera.
