NO

The image does not show clear signs of obstruction, covering, or damage by mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products on the camera. It appears that the image quality is low or that there might be motion blur, which can be caused by the camera moving quickly while taking the picture or by photographing fast-moving objects, especially if the camera has a slow shutter speed. However, there's no visible evidence of the specific substances you mentioned being on the camera lens.
