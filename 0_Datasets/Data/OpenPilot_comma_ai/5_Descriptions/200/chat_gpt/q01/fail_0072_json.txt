These types of contaminants usually leave distinctive marks, blurs, or areas of opacity, which are not present in this image. The clarity of the scene and the visibility of details, such as the crosswalk lines and parked cars, suggest the camera lens itself was not compromised by such materials at the time this image was captured. The quality issue seems more likely related to sensor noise, poor lighting conditions, or a low-quality camera rather than an external substance on the lens.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
