NO

The image appears blurry, which could be due to motion blur (the vehicle moving while the camera's shutter was open) rather than the camera being obstructed or covered by those substances. There is no clear evidence in this image of mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products directly on the camera lens. Of course, without further context or inspection of the camera itself, this assessment is based solely on the visual information provided in the image.
