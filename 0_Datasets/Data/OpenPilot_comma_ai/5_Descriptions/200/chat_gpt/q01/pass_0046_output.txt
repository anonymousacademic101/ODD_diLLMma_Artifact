NO.

The camera does not appear to be obstructed, covered, or damaged by mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products. The blur and darkness in the image seem to be due to low lighting conditions and possibly motion blur rather than an obstruction on the camera lens. There is no visible evidence of the aforementioned substances on the lens.
