The image is dark and grainy, which more likely indicates low light conditions or limitations in the camera's sensor sensitivity, rather than an obstruction or damage to the camera itself from mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products. There are no visible signs of smears, distortions, or residues that would typically suggest such obstructions or damage on the camera's lens.
