The image provided appears to be clear without any obvious obstructions covering the lens such as mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products. There may be some low-light or graininess in the image, but this does not necessarily indicate that the lens was obstructed; rather, it could be due to the camera's settings, quality, or the lighting conditions in the environment.
