However, there's no evidence of obstruction, covering, or damage from mud, ice, snow, paint, or adhesive products specifically on the camera lens itself based on this image alone. The details of the road, lane markings, and vehicles are still discernible despite the poor image quality, which suggests that the problems likely originate from other causes than physical obstructions on the camera."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
