NO

The image doesn't show clear evidence that the camera was obstructed, covered, or damaged by substances like mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products. Generally, when a camera lens is covered or obstructed by such substances, the picture taken would show more pronounced blurriness, discoloration, or physical markings indicating the presence of these materials. The image appears dark and taken at night, which explains the low visibility and blue tint. However, there may be some minor lens artifacts or smudges as evidenced by the somewhat blurry spots of light, but these do not suggest heavy obstruction or damage from the listed substances.
