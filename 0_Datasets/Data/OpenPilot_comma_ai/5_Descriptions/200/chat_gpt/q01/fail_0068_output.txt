The image appears to be underexposed, rather than obstructed or covered by mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products. This underexposure could be due to incorrect camera settings, shooting against a bright light source, or a technical malfunction, but there is no clear evidence of physical obstruction on the lens itself.
