The image appears to be a low-light or night-time photo with no obvious distortions or markings that would suggest such contamination. The clarity of the road lines and distant lights suggests that the camera lens was relatively clean at the moment the image was captured.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
