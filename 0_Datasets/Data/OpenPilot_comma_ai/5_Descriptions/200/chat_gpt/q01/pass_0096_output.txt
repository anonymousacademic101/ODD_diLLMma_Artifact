Based on the image provided, the blurriness and lack of clarity are more likely due to motion blur and low light conditions rather than the lens being obstructed, covered, or damaged by substances such as mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products. The light streaks and overall haziness are indicative of camera movement or a longer exposure time in a low-light setting, rather than an obstruction on the camera lens.
