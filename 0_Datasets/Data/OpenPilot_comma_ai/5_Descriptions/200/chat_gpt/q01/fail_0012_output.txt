NO.

The image provided is blurry and lacks clarity, which might give the impression that the camera lens was obstructed or dirty. However, this loss of quality is more likely due to motion blur or a low-resolution capture rather than an obstruction like mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products on the lens. There are no visible artifacts on the image that would typically indicate the presence of such substances on the camera lens.
