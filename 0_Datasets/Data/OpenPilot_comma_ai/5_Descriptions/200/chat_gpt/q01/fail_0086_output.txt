NO.

The image appears to show a blurred object or light streak, possibly taken while the camera was in motion or focused on a fast-moving object. The blurriness is more likely due to motion blur or camera settings rather than an obstruction or damage like mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products. The rest of the image seems relatively clear and does not exhibit the typical patterns or distortions you would expect if the camera lens were obscured or damaged by such substances.
