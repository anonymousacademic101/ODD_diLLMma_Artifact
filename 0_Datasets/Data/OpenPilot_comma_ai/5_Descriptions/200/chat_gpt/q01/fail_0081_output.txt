NO.

The image appears to be unclear due to low light and possibly a high ISO setting leading to noise and graininess in the photo. There are no visible signs in the image that the camera lens was obstructed by mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products; rather, the poor image quality seems to be a result of low visibility conditions and camera settings.
