YES

The image provided is completely black which suggests that no light was able to reach the camera's sensor. This could be due to an obstruction covering the lens, such as mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or an adhesive product, assuming the camera was functional and the lens cap was not simply left on or the camera turned off. However, without further evidence, I cannot determine the exact cause of the obstruction.
