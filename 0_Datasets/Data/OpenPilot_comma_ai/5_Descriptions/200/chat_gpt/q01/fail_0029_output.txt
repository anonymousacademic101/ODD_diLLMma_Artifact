NO

The quality of the image does seem compromised, but there are no clear signs of the camera being covered or damaged by mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products as specified in your question. The blur present could suggest movement or an out-of-focus shot, and the darkness could be due to low light conditions rather than an obstruction.
