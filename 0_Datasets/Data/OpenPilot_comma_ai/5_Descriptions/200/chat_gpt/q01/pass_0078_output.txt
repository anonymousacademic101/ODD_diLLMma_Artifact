The image quality does not indicate that the camera lens was obstructed, covered, or damaged by mud, ice, snow, excessive paint or adhesive products. There are no visible artifacts on the image that would suggest such an obstruction. The image may be blurry or have a low resolution, but that does not necessarily indicate that any of the mentioned substances are on the camera lens.
