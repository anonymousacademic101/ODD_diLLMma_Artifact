The image provided appears to be blurred, most likely due to motion rather than any obstruction, coverage, or damage to the camera by substances such as mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products. This motion blur effect often happens when the subject is moving rapidly and the camera's shutter speed isn't fast enough to freeze the action, or when the camera itself is in motion.
