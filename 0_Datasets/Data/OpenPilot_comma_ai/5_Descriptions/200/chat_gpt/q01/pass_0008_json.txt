While the photo is slightly skewed and the top part seems slightly blurred, which might indicate motion or a lens quality issue, there are no visible smears, splatters, or obstructions that would typically result from such substances. The road markings and surrounding environment are visible and mostly clear, suggesting that the lens was not significantly compromised by any of those materials at the time the photo was taken.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
