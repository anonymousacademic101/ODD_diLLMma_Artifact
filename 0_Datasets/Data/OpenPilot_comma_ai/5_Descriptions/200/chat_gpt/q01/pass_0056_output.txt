NO

The image appears to be a nighttime scene with relatively clear visibility and no obvious obstructions on the camera lens such as mud, ice, snow, paint, or adhesive products. The road is visible, and the markings as well as the lights from vehicles in the distance are clear. If the camera had been obstructed or covered by such substances, we would expect to see smudges, areas of opacity, or other visual artifacts on the picture.
