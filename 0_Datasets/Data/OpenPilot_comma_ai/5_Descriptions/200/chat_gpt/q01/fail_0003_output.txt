NO

The image provided is extremely blurry and lacks clarity, which could indicate a focus issue or movement, rather than an obstruction on the camera lens. The absence of any visible residue or texture that might suggest mud, ice, snow, paint, or adhesive products leads to this conclusion. The blurriness might be due to rapid movement, low resolution, or a camera error, but it does not specifically indicate that the lens was physically obstructed or covered by any of the mentioned substances.
