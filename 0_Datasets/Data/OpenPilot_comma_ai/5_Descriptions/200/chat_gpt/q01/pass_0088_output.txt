NO.

The image provided appears relatively clear with no obvious obstructions or damage from mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products. The clarity of the road lines and the visibility of distant lights suggest that the lens was not significantly obstructed or damaged when the photo was taken. However, the image is dark and grainy, which is likely due to low lighting conditions and the limitations of the camera's sensor in a nighttime setting rather than an obstruction or damage to the camera.
