NO.

The image appears blurry, which could be due to camera movement, incorrect focus, or a low-quality camera, but there is no visible obstruction on the camera lens like mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products. The lack of any visible artifacts or obstructive material on the lens surface suggests the camera itself wasn't covered or damaged as described.
