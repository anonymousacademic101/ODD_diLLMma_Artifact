NO

The image provided is of low quality and seems to be taken at night with reduced visibility, but there do not appear to be any obstructions such as mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products on the camera lens that took the photograph. Instead, it seems likely that the poor image quality is due to other factors such as low light, high ISO, motion blur, or a low-resolution camera sensor, rather than physical obstruction.
