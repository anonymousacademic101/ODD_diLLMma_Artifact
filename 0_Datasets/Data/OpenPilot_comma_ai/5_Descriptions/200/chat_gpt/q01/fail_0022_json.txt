The clarity and absence of artifacts that would be associated with such obstructions suggest that the image was taken with an unobstructed lens. However, the image is blurry and poorly framed, which could be due to motion blur, out-of-focus capture, or a low-quality camera, rather than obstruction of the camera lens.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
