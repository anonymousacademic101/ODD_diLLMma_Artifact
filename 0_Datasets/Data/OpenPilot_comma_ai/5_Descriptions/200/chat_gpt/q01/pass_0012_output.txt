NO

The image is dark and grainy, which might indicate that it was taken with a camera with a low resolution or under low light conditions. However, there are no visible signs on the image itself that suggest that the camera lens was obstructed, covered, or damaged by mud, ice, snow, excessive paint, or adhesive products. The details that are present (such as the vehicles and road markings) appear intact without smears or obstructions that would indicate such damage to the camera.
