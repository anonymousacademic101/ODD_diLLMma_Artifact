Mud, ice, or paint would leave a textured layer or splatters on the image, while adhesives might cause a smeared or cloudy appearance. Here, the entire image is affected uniformly, suggesting a quality issue with the image capture process rather than with something on the camera lens."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
