NO

In the provided image, the road appears to be clear of any ongoing construction work. There are no visible signs of construction such as equipment, barriers, workers, or unfinished road surfaces that would indicate active road work. However, it's worth noting that the image is relatively dark and has limited visibility, so while no construction is apparent in the visible section, it's not possible to confirm the condition of the road beyond what the image shows.
