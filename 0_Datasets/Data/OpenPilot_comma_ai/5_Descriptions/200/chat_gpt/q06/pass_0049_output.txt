I don't see any construction equipment, signs, cones, barriers, or active construction work visible in the image provided. The road appears to be clear and unobstructed, allowing for normal driving conditions. However, it's important to note that the provided image shows a limited view, and construction could be present beyond the field of vision or at another location not shown in the image.
