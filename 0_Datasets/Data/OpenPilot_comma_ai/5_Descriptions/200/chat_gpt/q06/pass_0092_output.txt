NO.

The image provided is of extremely low resolution and quality, which makes it difficult to discern specific details that would indicate construction. There are no clear signs such as construction equipment, barriers, workers, or typical roadwork indicators visible in the image. However, without further context or a clearer image, it is not possible to definitively determine whether there is construction on the road. My response is based solely on the visible aspects of the provided image.
