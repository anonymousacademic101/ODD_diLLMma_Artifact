The contrast in the blackness of the asphalt also suggests recent paving activities. The lines are bright and unblemished, indicating they may have just been applied. There also appears to be a divider with a reflective surface, suggesting recent road safety improvements.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
