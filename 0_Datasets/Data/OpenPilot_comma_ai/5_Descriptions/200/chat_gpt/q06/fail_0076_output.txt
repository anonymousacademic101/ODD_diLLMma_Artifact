The image provided is low resolution and appears to be taken in low light conditions, making it difficult to discern fine details. There is no clear evidence of construction equipment, signs, barriers, or roadwork in the visible section of the road. However, without a clearer and broader view, it cannot be definitively stated that there is no construction further along the road or outside the frame of this image.
