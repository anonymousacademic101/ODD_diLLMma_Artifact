NO

The image shows a stretch of road at night with no visible signs of construction such as construction equipment, barriers, or workers. The lanes are clearly marked and there are no indications of lane closures or detours that would typically be present in a construction zone. However, it's important to note that visibility is limited due to the nighttime setting, and there might be construction further along the road that is not visible in this specific image.
