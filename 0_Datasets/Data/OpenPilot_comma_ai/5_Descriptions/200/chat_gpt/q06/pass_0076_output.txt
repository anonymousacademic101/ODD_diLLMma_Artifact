The road in the image has clear signs of recent or ongoing construction, marked by the freshly painted road lines and the absence of wear and tear typically seen on older sections of road. The contrast in the blackness of the asphalt also suggests recent paving activities. The lines are bright and unblemished, indicating they may have just been applied. There also appears to be a divider with a reflective surface, suggesting recent road safety improvements.
