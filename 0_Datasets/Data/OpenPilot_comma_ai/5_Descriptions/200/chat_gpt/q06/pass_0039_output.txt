NO.

The image provided shows a section of a road at night with visible lane markings, and there do not appear to be any visible signs of construction such as cones, barriers, equipment, or construction workers. It shows an uninterrupted roadway. However, visibility is limited due to the nighttime setting, so it is not possible to conclusively determine the absence of construction further down the road beyond what is illuminated.
