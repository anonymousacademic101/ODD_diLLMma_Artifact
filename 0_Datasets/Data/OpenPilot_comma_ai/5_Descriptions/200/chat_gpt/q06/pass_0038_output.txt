NO.

Based on the image provided, there are no clear indications of road construction such as construction equipment, orange cones, signs, or workers that are typically associated with road construction zones. The lane markings are visible, and traffic appears to be moving normally, which suggests the absence of construction activity. However, without broader context or additional visual information such as daytime visibility or different angles, it is impossible to determine with absolute certainty whether there is construction further down the road or outside the field of view of this image.
