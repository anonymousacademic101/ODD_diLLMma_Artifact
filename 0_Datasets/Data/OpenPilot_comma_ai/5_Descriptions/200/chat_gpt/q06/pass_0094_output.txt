NO

From the provided image, it is not possible to determine definitively if there is construction on the road due to the low resolution and darkness. There are no visible signs of construction such as cones, barriers, construction equipment, or workers that can be identified within the limited view. However, without better visibility or additional context, it is impossible to conclusively state that there is no construction further down the road or out of view.
