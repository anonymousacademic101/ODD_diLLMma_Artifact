NO.

From the image provided, I don't see any clear signs of construction such as construction vehicles, cones, barriers, workers, or roadwork signs. The road appears to be clear and open for traffic without visible construction activity. However, it's important to note that the image only shows a small segment of the road, and construction could possibly be present outside the frame or further along the road out of sight.
