NO.

The view provided shows a road at night, and there are no obvious signs of construction such as construction equipment, barriers, roadwork signs, or unfinished road surfaces. However, it should be noted that the view is limited and does not cover the entire road, so construction could be present out of the field of view or further along the road.
