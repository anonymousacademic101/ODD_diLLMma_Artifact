NO.

The image provided is too blurry and lacks clear details that would indicate construction on the road. The photo appears to have been taken at night and possibly while in motion, making it difficult to discern any definitive signs of construction such as equipment, barriers, or roadwork signs. Therefore, without clear evidence, we cannot confirm the presence of construction on the road.
