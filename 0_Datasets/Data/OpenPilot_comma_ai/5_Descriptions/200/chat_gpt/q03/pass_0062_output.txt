An on-off ramp typically refers to the transition roads that allow vehicles to enter or exit expressways or highways. This road appears to be a standard city street with parked cars along the sides, rather than an on-off ramp which would not have parked cars and would usually be marked with signs or have a different design to facilitate the merge onto or off of a faster roadway.
