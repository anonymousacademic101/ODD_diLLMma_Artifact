NO.

The road in the image appears to be a standard urban or suburban street rather than an on-off ramp. On-off ramps are typically associated with highways or freeways and are designed to help vehicles transition between different speeds necessary for the highway and local roads. The road in the image has multiple lanes, markings for a pedestrian crossing, and surrounding buildings or vegetation typical of a local road. Additionally, there seems to be a motorcycle traveling ahead in the opposite direction, indicating two-way traffic common in non-highway settings.
