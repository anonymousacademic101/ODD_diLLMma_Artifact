The road visible in the image appears to be a regular intersection, not a highway on-off ramp. On-off ramps typically do not have perpendicular cross streets as seen here, where the main road intersects with another road that allows for traffic from a side street. Additionally, on-off ramps generally have curvature to manage the speed transition between highway and local road speeds, and they are usually designed without the traditional crosswalks and traffic signals that are visible in this image.
