The image shown depicts a road with marked lanes and reflective lane markers common on highways or primary roads. Typically, an on-off ramp would not have such long straight stretches without showing signs of an exit or entrance to a highway. The road in the image appears to be a regular through lane rather than a ramp designed for vehicles to enter or exit a highway.
