On-off ramps typically have specific designs such as being connected directly to a highway, featuring acceleration and deceleration lanes, and specific signage which is not visible in this image. The scene looks more like an urban setting with buildings and potential commercial or industrial facilities, which would not typically be immediately adjacent to a highway on-off ramp.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
