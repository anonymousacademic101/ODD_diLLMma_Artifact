YES.

The road in the image appears to be an on-off ramp due to several visual clues. First, the curvature and the inclined nature of the road suggest it is leading onto or off of a main roadway, typical of an on-off ramp. Second, the lane markings consist of dashes that are often used for merging lanes, supporting the idea that this is a point of transition between roads. These features are common characteristics of on-off ramps found on highways and freeways.
