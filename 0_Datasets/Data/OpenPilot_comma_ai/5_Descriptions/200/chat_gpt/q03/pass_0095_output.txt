The image shows a road with multiple lanes and traffic lights ahead. On-off ramps typically do not have traffic lights as they are designed for entering or exiting highways or freeways, where traffic flow does not typically require stop and go signals. This road looks more like a city street or urban road due to the presence of traffic lights and what appears to be regular street lighting.
