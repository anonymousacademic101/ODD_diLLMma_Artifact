NO.

The road in the image appears to be a regular city street or a parking lane rather than an on-off ramp. There are parked cars along the side of the road, which is typical for city streets and not characteristic of an on-off ramp, which would normally have no parked cars and would be designed for vehicles to enter or exit a freeway at higher speeds.
