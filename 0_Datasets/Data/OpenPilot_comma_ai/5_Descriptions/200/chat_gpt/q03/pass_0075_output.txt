NO.

This road does not appear to be an on-off ramp. On-off ramps typically connect highways to local roads and feature either entrance or exit signs, tapering lanes, acceleration or deceleration lanes, and are designed to manage the speed of vehicles merging onto or off of the highway. This road looks like a standard two-way road due to the presence of double yellow lines, which typically indicate no passing and separate opposing lanes of traffic. On-off ramps usually do not have such markings as they are primarily one-way for entering or exiting traffic.
