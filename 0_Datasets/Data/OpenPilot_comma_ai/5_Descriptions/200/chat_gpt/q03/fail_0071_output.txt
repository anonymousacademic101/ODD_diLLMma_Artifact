NO.

Based on the provided image, it is not possible to determine conclusively whether the road is an on-off ramp due to the limited perspective. The visible vehicles and road conditions do not provide specific indicators typical of an on-off ramp, such as signage, tapering lanes, or the curvature often associated with ramps. Instead, it appears to be a multi-lane highway or road with traffic, which might be slowing or stopped, suggesting regular traffic conditions rather than the specific dynamics of an on-off ramp.
