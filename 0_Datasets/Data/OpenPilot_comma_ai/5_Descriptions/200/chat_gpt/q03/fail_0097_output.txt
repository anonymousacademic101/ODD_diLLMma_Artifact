The road appears to be a regular street intersection rather than an on-off ramp. On-off ramps generally facilitate the transition between surface streets and freeways or highways. They do not have crosswalks or intersection traffic control signals. The image shows a crosswalk, which suggests it is an ordinary street intersection and not an on-off ramp.
