The image shows a road with what appears to be a solid white line on the right side and a dashed line closer to the center, which are typical markings for a standard road lane, not specifically an on-off ramp. Additionally, there are storefronts and sidewalks directly adjacent to the road, which is not a common feature of highway on-off ramps, as those are typically designed for transitioning between high-speed highways and local roads and usually do not have direct access to commercial storefronts.
