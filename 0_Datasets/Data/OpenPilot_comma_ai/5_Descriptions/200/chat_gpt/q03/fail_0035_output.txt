The image you’ve provided appears to show a regular street rather than an on-off ramp. On-off ramps are generally associated with highways or freeways and feature certain design characteristics to facilitate the transition to and from high-speed roadways. In contrast, the image shows a vehicle parked on the side of the road, marked pedestrian crossings, and buildings close to the street—all features that are typical of urban or residential streets rather than highway ramps.
