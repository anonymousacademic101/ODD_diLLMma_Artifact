The image shows a road with multiple lanes, parked cars along the sides, and buildings that appear to be typical for a city or urban environment. On-off ramps typically connect highways to local roads and do not have parked cars or the type of urban infrastructure visible here. This looks more like a typical street within a city, not a ramp designed for entering or exiting a freeway or highway.
