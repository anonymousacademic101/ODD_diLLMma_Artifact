The road in the image does not appear to be an on-off ramp. On-off ramps are typically associated with highways and are designed to allow vehicles to enter and exit high-speed roadways safely. The road in the image seems to be a regular city street or residential area, as indicated by the parallel parked cars, the two-way traffic, and the lack of signage or markings that usually denote highway on-off ramps.
