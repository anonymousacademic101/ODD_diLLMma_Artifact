The image seems to show a regular intersection rather than an on-off ramp. The text on the road says "KEEP CLEAR" which is commonly found at intersections to prevent blocking cross traffic. Additionally, the presence of pedestrian crossings and parked cars suggests a standard urban road environment. On-off ramps typically connect freeways to local roads and do not have such features.
