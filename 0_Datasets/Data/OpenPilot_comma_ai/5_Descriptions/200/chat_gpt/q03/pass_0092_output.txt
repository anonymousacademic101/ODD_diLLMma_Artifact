NO.

Based on the image provided, it is impossible to confirm whether the road is an on-off ramp due to the extremely low visibility and lack of distinguishing features or context. The image is too dark and unclear to make out details such as lane markings, signage, or the road's structure that would indicate whether it is an on-off ramp.
