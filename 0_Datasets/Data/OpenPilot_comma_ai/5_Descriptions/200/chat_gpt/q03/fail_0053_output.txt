The image provided is quite dark and lacks details, which makes it challenging to determine the specific characteristics of the road. However, from the picture, it seems to show a straight section of a road without any clear signs or markings that would typically indicate an on-ramp or off-ramp of a highway. Typically, on-off ramps have curving paths or visible signage distinguishing them from regular roads, which are not evident in this image.
