NO.

The image shows a road that appears to be a typical street or a driveway rather than a dedicated on-off ramp commonly associated with highways or freeways. On-off ramps usually have specific design features to facilitate the smooth flow of traffic merging onto or off of high-speed roads, and this road does not exhibit those characteristics. It lacks signage, acceleration/deceleration lanes, and other infrastructure typically seen on highway ramps.
