NO

The image provided is too blurry to clearly identify the specific features of the road. However, the visible elements do not strongly suggest that it's an on-off ramp which typically would have more defined features such as signage, lane markings for merging or diverging traffic, and a curvature indicating an exit or entrance to a highway. The lack of these discernible features in the image makes it difficult to conclusively identify the road as an on-off ramp.
