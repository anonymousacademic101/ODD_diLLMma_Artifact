The road in the image appears to be a regular urban street rather than an on-off ramp. The presence of parked cars along the curb, road markings that include a bike lane, and the urban environment with buildings and signs typically found within a city suggest that this is not designed for the speeds or purposes of an on-off ramp associated with highways or freeways.
