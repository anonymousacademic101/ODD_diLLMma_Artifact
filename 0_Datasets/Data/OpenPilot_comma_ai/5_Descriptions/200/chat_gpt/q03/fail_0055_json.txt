It looks more like a regular city street or urban road. There are parked cars along the side, which is typically not a feature of an on-off ramp. On-off ramps are usually connected to highways or freeways and do not have parking spaces. Additionally, on-off ramps are designed to allow vehicles to accelerate to or decelerate from highway speeds, which does not seem to be the case in this image.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
