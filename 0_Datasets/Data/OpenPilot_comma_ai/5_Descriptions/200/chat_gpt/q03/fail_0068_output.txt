YES

The image indicates that we are on a road with a sign showing a figure with a shovel, which typically denotes road work or construction ahead. This sign does not provide any direct information to conclusively determine whether we are on an on-off ramp. My initial affirmation was an error as there is no sufficient information to make that determination. Without additional context or visual clues suggesting we are on an on-off ramp, such as directional arrows, merge signs, or a clear view of the roadway configuration, I cannot confirm the specific nature of this road section.
