The road appears to be a regular street or side road rather than an on-off ramp. On-off ramps typically have very specific designs to manage the speed and merging of vehicles to and from highways. This road looks too narrow, lacks clear merging lanes or acceleration/deceleration lanes, and is situated next to a parking lot and other amenities, which are not characteristic of highway ramps.
