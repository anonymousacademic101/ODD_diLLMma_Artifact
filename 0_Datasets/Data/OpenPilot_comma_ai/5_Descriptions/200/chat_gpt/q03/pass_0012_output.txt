The image provided shows a multi-lane road with vehicles driving and lining up in traffic lanes, indicative of a highway or a major roadway rather than an on-off ramp. On-off ramps typically have fewer lanes (often only one or two) and are designed for vehicles to decelerate when exiting a highway or to accelerate when merging onto it. The scene depicted does not seem to fit the characteristics of an on-off ramp.
