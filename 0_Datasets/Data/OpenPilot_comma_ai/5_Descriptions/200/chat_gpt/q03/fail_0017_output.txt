NO.

The image shows a regular street intersection rather than an on-off ramp. On-off ramps typically connect highways or motorways with local roads or other highways and have a distinct design that accommodates the speed change required when entering or exiting a highway. This image lacks features typical of on-off ramps, such as acceleration or deceleration lanes and signage pertaining to highway access. Instead, it appears to be a standard urban or suburban road with access to a parking area or a side street, indicated by the presence of a sidewalk, parked cars, and low-speed traffic management characteristics.
