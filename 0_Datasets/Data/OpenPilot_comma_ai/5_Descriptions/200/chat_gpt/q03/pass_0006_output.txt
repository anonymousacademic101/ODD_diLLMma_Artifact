NO.

The image provided shows a vehicle in front of the viewer's perspective with its brake lights on, suggesting it is either stopping or already stopped. The glimpses on the sides hint at what might be buildings or structures common to urban settings, not typically resembling the open or unobstructed views often associated with on-off ramps. Additionally, on-off ramps usually do not have vehicles directly in front of each other at a complete stop unless there is heavy traffic or congestion specifically at an exit/entrance point. Without more context or a clearer view of signage or road layout, it cannot be definitively concluded that this is an on-off ramp.
