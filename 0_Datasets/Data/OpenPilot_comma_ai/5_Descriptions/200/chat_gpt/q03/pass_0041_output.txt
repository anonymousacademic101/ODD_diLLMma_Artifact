NO.

The road depicted in the image seems to be a straight section of a highway or multi-lane road, as indicated by the continuous and dashed lane markings, as well as the reflective road studs (cat's eyes). On-off ramps typically have a curved design to allow vehicles to safely accelerate or decelerate when entering or exiting a highway, and this road appears to lack those characteristics. Moreover, there are no visible signs of an exit or entrance, which are common features for on-off ramps.
