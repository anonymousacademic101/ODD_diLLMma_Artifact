YES.

This appears to be an on-off ramp based on several visual cues. Typically, such ramps have distinguishing features, including dashed lane lines indicating a merging or diverging area, signage to direct toward highway entry or exit (not visible in this image but often present), a narrowing or expansion of the roadway, and often a curvature of the road where it joins with the main highway lanes. The visible line markings and the layout of this road section suggest that it's designed for vehicles to either enter or exit a highway.
