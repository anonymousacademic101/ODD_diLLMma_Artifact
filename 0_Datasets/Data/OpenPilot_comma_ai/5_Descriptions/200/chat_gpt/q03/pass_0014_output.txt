NO.

What's visible in the image does not exhibit the usual characteristics of an on-off ramp. On-off ramps typically connect highways to local roads and have distinct curves or merging lanes designed to regulate the speed of entering or exiting vehicles; they also often have signage indicating the ramp's direction or destination. The road in this image appears to be a typical city street or a parking area entrance/exit, characterized by the presence of multiple parked cars and a flat, straight roadway without any apparent signs or features that are typical for an on-off ramp.
