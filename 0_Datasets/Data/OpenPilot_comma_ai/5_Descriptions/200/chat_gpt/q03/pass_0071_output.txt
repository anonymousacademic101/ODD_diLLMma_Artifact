The image shows a road with multiple lanes of traffic, but there is no clear indication that this specific section is an on-off ramp. On-off ramps typically have clearer markings or signs indicating an exit or entrance to a highway, and while the right-hand side appears to be an exit lane due to the solid white line and its increase in width, it's not definitive evidence of an on-off ramp without additional contextual information.
