An on-off ramp typically connects highways to local roads and has a different design, usually with lane markings indicating merging traffic, which do not seem to be present in this image. Additionally, the presence of buildings closely flanking the street suggests it is an urban road rather than a highway interchange.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
