The image shows a section of road that does not exhibit the typical characteristics of an on-off ramp. On-off ramps are usually connected to highways or freeways and are designed to allow vehicles to enter or exit at higher speeds with curving paths or straight approaches that merge. The image here displays a straight section of road adjacent to buildings without the visible features of a highway or structure that would suggest it is an on-off ramp.
