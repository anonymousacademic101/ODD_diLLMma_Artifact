NO.

The image provided is quite blurry and it is taken at night, which significantly reduces the visibility of road features that would indicate whether it is an on-off ramp. There are no clear signs, road markings, or the typical curvature that are generally associated with on-off ramps to conclusively determine the type of road. Therefore, without these indicators, it cannot be confidently stated that the road is an on-off ramp from this image alone.
