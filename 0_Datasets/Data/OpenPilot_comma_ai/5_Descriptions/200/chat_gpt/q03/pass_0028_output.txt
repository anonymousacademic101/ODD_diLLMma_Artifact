The road in the image appears to be an on-off ramp due to the presence of solid lines along the sides of the lane, which typically indicate a boundary separating the ramp from the main roadway. Additionally, the narrowing of the road and the presence of construction barriers reinforce the impression that this is an on-off ramp, which is often subject to construction or temporary modifications to manage traffic flow.
