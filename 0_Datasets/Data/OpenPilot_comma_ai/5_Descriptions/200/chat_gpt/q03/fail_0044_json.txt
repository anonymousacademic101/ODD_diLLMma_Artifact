However, the visible road markings appear to be consistent with a regular multi-lane road rather than an on-off ramp. On-off ramps typically have distinctive features such as tapering lanes, merge or exit signs, and specific lane markings to guide vehicle movements for entering or leaving highways, which are not clearly visible here. The absence of such clear indicators suggests that this may not be an on-off ramp.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
