NO.

The road in the image seems to be a multi-lane highway or a freeway, but not an on-off ramp. The lanes are marked for through traffic with dashed lines typically used for lane division on highways. There are multiple lanes, and there isn't any signage or lane design that would indicate it is an on-off ramp. Additionally, thereâ€™s no visible curvature or divergence/convergence that would suggest it is an on-off ramp, which are usually single lanes that split off from the main highway to allow vehicles to enter or exit.
