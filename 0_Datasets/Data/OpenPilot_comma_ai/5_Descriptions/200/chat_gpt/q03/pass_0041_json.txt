On-off ramps typically have a curved design to allow vehicles to safely accelerate or decelerate when entering or exiting a highway, and this road appears to lack those characteristics. Moreover, there are no visible signs of an exit or entrance, which are common features for on-off ramps."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
