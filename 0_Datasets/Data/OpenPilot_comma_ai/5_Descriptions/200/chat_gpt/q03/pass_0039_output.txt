YES.

The curvature of the road, along with the lane markings that typically guide drivers into merging or exiting lanes, suggest this is an on-ramp or off-ramp. The presence of a merge sign visible in the distance further supports this conclusion. On-off ramps are designed with such curves to facilitate the safe merging of vehicles onto or off of highways.
