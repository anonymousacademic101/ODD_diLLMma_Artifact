NO.

The image shows a road with a double yellow line which typically indicates a two-way road where passing is not allowed. On-off ramps usually do not have double yellow lines since they are meant to serve as entry and exit points to and from highways or expressways, not for two-way traffic. The curvature and the incline in the road could suggest it is leading up to or away from an overpass or bridge, rather than being an on-off ramp.
