Based on the image provided, it appears that we are on a road at night with traffic lanes separated by solid and dashed lines. The presence of these road markings and oncoming traffic suggests it is a standard road. On-off ramps typically have different markings and guide drivers either onto or off a highway, and there are no visible indications that this is an on-off ramp, such as exit or entry lanes, signs, or acceleration/deceleration lanes that are characteristic of on-off ramp designs.
