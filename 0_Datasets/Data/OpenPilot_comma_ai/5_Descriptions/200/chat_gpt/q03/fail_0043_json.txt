However, it does not clearly show typical features of an on-off ramp, such as signage indicating entrance or exit to a highway, lane markings for acceleration or deceleration, or a clear view of an adjoining highway. Instead, the environment seems more consistent with a local street or road due to the presence of adjacent properties and lack of highway characteristics.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
