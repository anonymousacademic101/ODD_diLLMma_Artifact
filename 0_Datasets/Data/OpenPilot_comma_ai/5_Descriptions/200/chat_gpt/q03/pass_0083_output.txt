YES.

The image shows a vehicle with its turn signal on (also known as a blinker or indicator), which typically indicates an upcoming turn or lane change. Additionally, the painted arrows on the roadway point to the right, suggesting a diverging path typical of an on-off ramp. Moreover, the presence of dashed white lines further indicates a lane designed for vehicles to merge onto or off of a main road. Given these clues, it is reasonable to conclude that the road depicted is an on-off ramp.
