NO.

The image provided shows a vehicle with a California license plate on a road with multiple lanes and traffic, which suggests it is a regular multi-lane road or highway rather than an on-off ramp. There is no clear signage or road design features visible in this image that would indicate it is an on-off ramp. Typically, on-off ramps are characterized by their function to allow vehicles to enter or exit highways; they tend to have clear signage and a design that facilitates a transition between highway speeds and local road speeds, neither of which are apparent in this image.
