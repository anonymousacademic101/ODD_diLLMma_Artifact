No.

The image provided does not have enough context or clarity to definitively identify the type of road. What is visible is a section of a road with a curb and what might be a sidewalk, which is typical of many types of roadsâ€”not specific enough to confirm it as an on-off ramp. On-off ramps usually have characteristics that are not visible here, such as signage indicating highway entrances or exits, acceleration or deceleration lanes, or particular curve designs to facilitate the transition between highway speeds and local road speeds.
