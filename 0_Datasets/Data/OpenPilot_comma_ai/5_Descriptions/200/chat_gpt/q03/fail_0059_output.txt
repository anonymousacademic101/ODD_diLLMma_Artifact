The image seems to show a vehicle at an intersection or possibly a turning lane on a regular street, rather than an on-off ramp. On-off ramps are typically associated with highways or freeways and usually do not have cross traffic as seen in the image. Additionally, the presence of what looks like a pedestrian crossing sign suggests a more urban setting where on-off ramps are not usually found.
