YES.

The road shown in the image appears to be an on-off ramp due to the presence of dashed lines that generally indicate a lane where vehicles can accelerate to merge onto a highway or decelerate to exit off a highway. Additionally, the curvature of the road and the spacing of the overhead lights are consistent with on-off ramps that connect main travel lanes with local roads.
