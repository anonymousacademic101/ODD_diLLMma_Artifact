NO.

The image provided does not offer sufficient context to definitively determine whether the road is an on-off ramp. From what is visible, we see a portion of a vehicle and what could be a regular street or roadway. There are no clear signs or road markings typically associated with an on-off ramp such as highway indicators, merge signs, acceleration/deceleration lane markings, or ramp-specific signage. Without these indicators or a broader view of the surrounding infrastructure, it's not possible to confirm that this is an on-off ramp.
