The road in the image appears to be an urban street or intersection rather than an on-off ramp. Typically, on-off ramps lack pedestrian crosswalks, traffic lights, and signs pertaining to local services like the bus transport sign visible here. Additionally, the presence of a person crossing the road on a scooter is an indication that this is an area intended for regular vehicular and pedestrian traffic, not the higher-speed, limited-access traffic of an on-off ramp.
