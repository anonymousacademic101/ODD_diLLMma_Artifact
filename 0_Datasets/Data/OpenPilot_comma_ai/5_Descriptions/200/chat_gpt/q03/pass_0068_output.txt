NO.

This does not appear to be an on-off ramp because the road lacks the defining characteristics of a typical ramp leading onto or off a highway. There are multiple lanes, and the traffic flow is continuous rather than merging or exiting, which is more indicative of a highway or a multilane road than an on-off ramp. Ramps usually have more pronounced curvature or tapering to facilitate the transition between roadways and typically involve merging traffic, neither of which is evident in the image provided.
