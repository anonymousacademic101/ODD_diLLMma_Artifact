NO.

The image shows a stretch of road at night with multiple lanes and what appears to be a median or barrier on the left side, indicating a divided highway or freeway. There's no clear evidence of an exit or entrance ramp in the visible portion of the road. On-off ramps typically have visible diverging or converging lane markings, neither of which are apparent in this image. Instead, it seems to be a straight section of a multi-lane road, possibly part of a main travel roadway rather than an on-off ramp.
