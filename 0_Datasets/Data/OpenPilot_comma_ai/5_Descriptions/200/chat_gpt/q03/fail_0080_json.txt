There are no clear signs, road markings, or the typical curvature that are generally associated with on-off ramps to conclusively determine the type of road. Therefore, without these indicators, it cannot be confidently stated that the road is an on-off ramp from this image alone.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
