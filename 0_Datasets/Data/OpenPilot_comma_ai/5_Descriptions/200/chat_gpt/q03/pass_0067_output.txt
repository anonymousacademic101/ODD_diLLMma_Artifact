The road in the image appears to be a multi-lane bridge or highway rather than an on-off ramp. On-off ramps typically have a single lane and are used for entering or exiting highways. This image shows multiple lanes with traffic, suggesting it is a main thoroughfare, and there's a visible structure that looks like a bridge, indicated by the steel beams and rivets often found in bridge construction.
