On-off ramps usually have solid lines delineating them and often curve more noticeably to join or leave the main flow of the highway. Additionally, there are multiple lanes visible, which is more common on a main road than on an on-off ramp. The lack of signs or signals typical of an on-off ramp also supports the conclusion that this is not an on-off ramp.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
