NO.

The image shows a road that appears to be a regular multi-lane highway or road rather than an on-off ramp. On-off ramps typically have a distinct curvature or tapering where they merge with or diverge from the main flow of traffic on highways or interstates, and this section of road does not display those characteristics; it looks like a straight segment of a road or highway.
