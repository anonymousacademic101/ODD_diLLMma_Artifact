On-off ramps typically have curving paths, yield or merge signs, and different lane markings designed to facilitate the safe acceleration and deceleration of vehicles as they enter or exit highways. The absence of such features in the image suggests it is not an on-off ramp.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
