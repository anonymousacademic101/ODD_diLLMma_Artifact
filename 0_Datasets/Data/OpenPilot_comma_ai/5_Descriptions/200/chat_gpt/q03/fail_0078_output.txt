The image provided is dark and doesn't offer a complete view of the road's context. The visible road markings do not appear to be those typically found on on-off ramps, such as yield or merge signs, nor can we see any clear indicators of an interchange area. However, the lack of context and low visibility in the image make it difficult to provide a definitive answer.
