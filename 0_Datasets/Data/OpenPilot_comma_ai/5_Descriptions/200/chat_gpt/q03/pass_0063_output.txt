NO.

The road appears to be a regular city street rather than an on-off ramp. There are multiple lanes with vehicles parked on the side, road markings for different lanes, traffic signals visible in the distance, and buildings alongside the road, which are typical for city streets. On-off ramps usually do not have these features and are specifically designed for entering or exiting highways or freeways.
