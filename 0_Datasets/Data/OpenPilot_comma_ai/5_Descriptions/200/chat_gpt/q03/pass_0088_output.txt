The image shows a road with a dashed white line, which typically indicates a lane on a highway or a main road where passing is allowed. On-off ramps usually have solid lines delineating them and often curve more noticeably to join or leave the main flow of the highway.

The lack of signs or signals typical of an on-off ramp also supports the conclusion that this is not an on-off ramp.
