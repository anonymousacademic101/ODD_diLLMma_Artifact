Based on the image provided, the road appears to be a straight stretch with continuous lane markings, which is more indicative of a standard highway or road segment rather than an on-off ramp. On-off ramps typically have distinctive features such as curving lanes, acceleration or deceleration lanes, and different markings or signs. However, without additional context or signage, it is not possible to definitively determine the road's designation solely from the lane markings visible in this image.
