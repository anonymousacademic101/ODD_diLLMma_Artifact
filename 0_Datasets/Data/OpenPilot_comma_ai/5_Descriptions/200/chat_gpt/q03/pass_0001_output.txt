The image shows a road that appears to curve to the right and is joining another lane from the left, which is characteristic of an on-off ramp connecting to a highway or major roadway. The solid white line that becomes dashed further along and the merging traffic patterns are indicative of an on- or off-ramp rather than a regular section of a highway or street.
