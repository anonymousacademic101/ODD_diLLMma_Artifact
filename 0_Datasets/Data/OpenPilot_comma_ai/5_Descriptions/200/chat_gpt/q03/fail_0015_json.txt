There is no clear signage or road design features visible in this image that would indicate it is an on-off ramp. Typically, on-off ramps are characterized by their function to allow vehicles to enter or exit highways; they tend to have clear signage and a design that facilitates a transition between highway speeds and local road speeds, neither of which are apparent in this image.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
