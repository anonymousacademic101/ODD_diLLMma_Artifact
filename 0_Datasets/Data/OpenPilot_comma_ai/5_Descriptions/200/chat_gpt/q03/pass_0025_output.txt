YES

The road appears to be an on-off ramp due to several indications. Firstly, the lanes are diverging, with one lane clearly exiting to the right, which is typical of a ramp connecting highways or major roads. Secondly, the road markings include dashed white lines that increase in spacing as they approach the exit, which is a common way to signal that a lane is ending or exiting. Lastly, there are vehicles aligned in a manner suggesting that they are either merging onto or off of a primary roadway. These factors combined suggest that this is indeed an on-off ramp.
