The picture shows a vehicle that appears to be parked on a street near a curb in an urban area. There are no signs or visible indicators common to on-ramps, such as highway entry signs, acceleration lanes, or merging traffic signs. The surrounding environment does not resemble a highway or expressway but rather a typical city street scene with buildings and sidewalks.
