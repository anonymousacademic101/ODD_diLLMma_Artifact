The lane markings and the positioning of the road seem to indicate that this is an on-off ramp, as it appears to diverge from the main roadway to the right, which is a common characteristic of such ramps. Additionally, the presence of street lights and signs at a distance further suggests this could be part of a ramp system adjacent to a highway.
