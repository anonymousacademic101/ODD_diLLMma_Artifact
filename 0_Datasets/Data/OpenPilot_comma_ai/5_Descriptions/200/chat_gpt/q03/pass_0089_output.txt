YES.

The road appears to be an on-off ramp due to several indicators common to such road designs: the curvature of the road, the division of lanes by dashed lines indicating a merging area, and lighting that suggests it is a transitional road connecting to a highway or main road, as indicated by the flow of traffic to the right which suggests a highway or multi-lane road. Additionally, the lack of any road signs or markers in the visible area indicating a different type of roadway supports the assessment that it is an on-off ramp.
