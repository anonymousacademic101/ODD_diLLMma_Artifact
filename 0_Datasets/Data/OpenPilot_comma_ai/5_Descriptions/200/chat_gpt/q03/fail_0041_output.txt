NO.

I cannot confirm the type of road or its function because the provided image does not offer a clear or complete view of the road layout. It's also challenging to distinguish any signage or road markings that would typically indicate an on-off ramp. It appears to be a section of a road with a barrier, but without further context or a broader view, I cannot accurately classify the road.
