There are multiple lanes, and the traffic flow is continuous rather than merging or exiting, which is more indicative of a highway or a multilane road than an on-off ramp. Ramps usually have more pronounced curvature or tapering to facilitate the transition between roadways and typically involve merging traffic, neither of which is evident in the image provided.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
