NO.

The image shows a road at night with multiple lanes, clear lane markings, and several vehicles on it. The road appears to be a highway or a multi-lane road rather than an on-off ramp. On-off ramps usually have a more distinct curvature, fewer lanes, and are typically for entering or exiting highways, rather than for through traffic. The image does not provide clear signs of an on-off ramp, such as merging or diverging lanes, acceleration or deceleration lanes, or directional signage specific to ramps.
