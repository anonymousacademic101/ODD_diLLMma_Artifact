On-off ramps usually have yield signs or merge signs if there is a need to wait for traffic before merging onto a freeway, but they don't typically have stop lines painted on the pavement as shown in the image. Additionally, the presence of a STOP sign at this location implies that it is not designed for high-speed merging, as would be the case on an on-off ramp."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
