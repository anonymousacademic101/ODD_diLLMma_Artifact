It looks like a typical city street featuring a pedestrian crosswalk, vehicles parked along the curb, and buildings flanking the road, which are not characteristics generally associated with highway on-off ramps. On-off ramps typically facilitate the transition between highways and local roads rather than featuring crosswalks and parked vehicles directly adjacent to the roadway as seen here.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
