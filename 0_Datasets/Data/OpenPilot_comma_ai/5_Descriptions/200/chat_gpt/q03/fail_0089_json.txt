However, it's important to note that the image is blurry and it is nighttime, which makes it difficult to determine the exact context of the road. There aren't distinct markers like signs or arrows visible that would typically indicate an on-off ramp. Despite these limitations, the angle and curvature of the road, along with the presence of vehicles in adjacent lanes, suggest it could be an on-off ramp. Nonetheless, without clearer visual indicators, this assessment is made with a degree of uncertainty."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
