NO.

The image provided is too dark and lacks clear context to identify the nature of the road conclusively. There are no visible road markings, signs, or other distinguishing characteristics that would typically indicate an on-off ramp, such as merging or diverging lanes, signage, or highway context. Without these indicators, it is not possible to affirmatively say that the road in the image is an on-off ramp.
