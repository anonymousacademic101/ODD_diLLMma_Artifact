NO.

The image provided is too dark and blurry to definitively determine the type of road we are on. There are no clear signs, lane markings, or other distinguishing features that would typically indicate that the road is specifically an on-off ramp, such as exit or entry signs or ramp metering. It appears to be a general roadway without the distinct characteristics of an on-off ramp. However, without more context or clearer visual cues, a definitive identification cannot be made.
