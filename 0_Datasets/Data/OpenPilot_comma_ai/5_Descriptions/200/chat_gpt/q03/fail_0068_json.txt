Without additional context or visual clues suggesting we are on an on-off ramp, such as directional arrows, merge signs, or a clear view of the roadway configuration, I cannot confirm the specific nature of this road section.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
