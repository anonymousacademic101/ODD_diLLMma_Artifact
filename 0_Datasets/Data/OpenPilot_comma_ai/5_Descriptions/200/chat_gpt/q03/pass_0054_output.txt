NO.

The image shows a road at night with dashed white lane markings that are typical for a main travel lane on a highway or a multi-lane road. On-off ramps, which are designed for entering or exiting highways, typically have solid white lines or other distinguishing markings, and often curve or have an incline/decline relative to the main highway. The road in the image appears to be a straight section without the distinguishing characteristics of an on-off ramp.
