The road in the image appears to be a regular highway or roadway due to the presence of multiple lanes, as indicated by the road markings, and the absence of any signs or road geometry typically associated with an on-ramp or off-ramp. On-off ramps generally have curving paths and are meant for vehicles to accelerate or decelerate to transition between highways and local roads, which is not evident in this straight roadway segment.
