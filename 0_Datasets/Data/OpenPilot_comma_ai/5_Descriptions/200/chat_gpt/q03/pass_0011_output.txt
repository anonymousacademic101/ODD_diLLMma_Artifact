NO.

The image shows multiple lanes of traffic with cars closely spaced and apparently stationary, which is more indicative of a traffic jam on a highway or a congested main road rather than an on-off ramp. On-off ramps typically have less congestion and are used for entering or exiting major highways, but this image does not clearly show an exit or entry point, nor does it provide any road signs or markings that would typically indicate an on-off ramp.
