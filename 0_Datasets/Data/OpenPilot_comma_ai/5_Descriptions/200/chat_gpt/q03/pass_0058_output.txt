The image provided shows a vehicle facing a curb with a clearly demarcated pedestrian crossing area indicated by yellow markings. This setting suggests that the vehicle is not on an on-off ramp, which is typically designed to facilitate the smooth flow of traffic from a highway to an exit or from an entry to a highway and would not feature such pedestrian crossing indicators or curbs in close proximity where vehicles are expected to merge or diverge at higher speeds.
