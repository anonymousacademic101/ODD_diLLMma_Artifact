The road in the image appears to be a main travel lane of a highway or multi-lane road rather than an on-off ramp due to the multiple lanes and steady flow of traffic. On-off ramps typically have a single lane and are designed for vehicles to accelerate to merge onto or decelerate to exit from the main highway.
