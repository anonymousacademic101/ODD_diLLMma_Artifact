There are no visible indicators such as ramp signs or road design that typically signify an on-off ramp. On-off ramps typically have distinct signage and merge lanes; they are designed to facilitate the safe transfer of vehicles to and from highways and are not directly visible in this image.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
