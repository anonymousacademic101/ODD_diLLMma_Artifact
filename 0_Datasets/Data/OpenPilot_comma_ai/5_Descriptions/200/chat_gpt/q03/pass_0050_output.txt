The road in the image appears to be an on-off ramp based on several indicators: it is a single-lane road, with visible entry or exit signs indicated by the arrows and words on the road surface, designed to facilitate vehicles entering or exiting a highway. Moreover, ramps typically have curved alignments and are separated from the main roadway by barriers or space as seen here.
