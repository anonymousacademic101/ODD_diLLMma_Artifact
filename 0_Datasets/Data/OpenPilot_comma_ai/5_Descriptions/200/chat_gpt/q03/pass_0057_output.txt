NO.

Based on the image provided, it is difficult to conclusively determine whether the road is an on-off ramp solely from the perspective and context presented. An on-off ramp typically would show signs of leading onto or off of a main highway, and could include signage, more curvature, or merging lanes. The image shows a straight stretch of road with what appears to be standard lane markings, but without additional context or a broader view, it's not possible to definitively identify it as an on-off ramp.
