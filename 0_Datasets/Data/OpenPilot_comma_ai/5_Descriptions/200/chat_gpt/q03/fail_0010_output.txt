NO.

The image seems to depict a stretch of road that features what appears to be a zebra crossing commonly found in urban areas rather than an on-off ramp. On-off ramps typically connect highways or motorways to local roads and do not have pedestrian crossings, as their design is intended for the smooth flow of traffic between different speeds of road networks. Additionally, on-off ramps do not usually have buildings directly adjacent to the road as this image appears to show, which is more characteristic of urban or suburban streets.
