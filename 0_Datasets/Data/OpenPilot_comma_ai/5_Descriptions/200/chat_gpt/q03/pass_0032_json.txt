There's no clear evidence of an exit or entrance ramp in the visible portion of the road. On-off ramps typically have visible diverging or converging lane markings, neither of which are apparent in this image. Instead, it seems to be a straight section of a multi-lane road, possibly part of a main travel roadway rather than an on-off ramp."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
