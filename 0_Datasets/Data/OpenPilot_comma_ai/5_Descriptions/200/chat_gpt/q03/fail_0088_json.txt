On-off ramps generally facilitate the movement of traffic onto and off of highways and do not include pedestrian crosswalks, as they are designed for vehicles merging or exiting at higher speeds. The presence of a crosswalk suggests this is likely an urban or suburban street rather than an on-off ramp.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
