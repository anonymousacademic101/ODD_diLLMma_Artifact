NO.

The road in the image appears to be a single-lane road without any visible intersections, acceleration/deceleration lanes, or signs that are typically associated with on-off ramps. The white line on the right indicates the edge of the lane, while the dashed white line on the left suggests it may be a lane for regular through traffic. The absence of features characteristic of an on-off ramp suggests that this is more likely a standard road or highway lane.
