The image shows a road at night with lane markings consistent with a regular traffic lane rather than an on-off ramp. There are no visible indicators such as ramp signs or road design that typically signify an on-off ramp. On-off ramps typically have distinct signage and merge lanes; they are designed to facilitate the safe transfer of vehicles to and from highways and are not directly visible in this image.
