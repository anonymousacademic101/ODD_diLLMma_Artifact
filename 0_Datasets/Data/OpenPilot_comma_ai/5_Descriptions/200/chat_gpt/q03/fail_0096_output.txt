The image provided does not show a road or any clear indicators of an on-off ramp, such as road markings, signs, or the typical geometry of an on-off ramp. Instead, the image shows a barrier with some safety netting, which doesn't provide enough context to determine the nature of the road, if there indeed is one present.
