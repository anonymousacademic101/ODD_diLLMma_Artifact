The image provided does not show a clear view of an entire road. It seems to depict a close-up segment of a surface with what appears to be a stair railing and possibly a curb or step, rather than a full road or ramp suitable for driving. With the limited context, it is impractical to definitively categorize the surface as an on-off ramp.
