The image appears to show a regular city street or intersection rather than an on-off ramp which would typically be connected to a highway or freeway. The presence of crosswalk lines suggests it is an area with pedestrian traffic, which is not characteristic of on-off ramps. The roadway has a solid white line and directional arrows painted on it, indicating lanes for turning or proceeding straight, which is more typical of urban road intersections.
