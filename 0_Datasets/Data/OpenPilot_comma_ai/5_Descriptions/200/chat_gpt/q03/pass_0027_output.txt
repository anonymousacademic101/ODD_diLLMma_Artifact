YES.

The road appears to be an on-off ramp due to several indications. Firstly, the lane markings: the dotted lines on the right side of the car taper off, which is common where a lane ends or merges, as seen on ramps. Additionally, the presence of a solid white line to the left and the absence of a shoulder or an exit sign directly suggests it might be an exit lane from a highway. Finally, the distribution of vehicles in a single-file line is typical for a ramp where traffic is either entering or exiting a freeway, rather than flowing in multiple lanes on a regular road.
