The visibility in the image is poor, but it is not possible to definitively attribute the low visibility to heavy rain, snow, fog, or specific adverse weather conditions based solely on the image provided. Visibility is poor due to the darkness and lack of adequate lighting in the scene, which makes it difficult to discern details. There's no clear evidence of precipitation such as rain or snow, and fog is not distinctly visible either. Thus, the reason for poor visibility appears to be the low light conditions rather than weather phenomena.
