The image provided does not show any indications of heavy rain, snow, fog, or any severe weather conditions that would cause poor visibility. It appears to be a clear day, although the image itself is not very sharp. However, this lack of sharpness seems to be due to the quality of the image or the motion blur rather than weather conditions.
