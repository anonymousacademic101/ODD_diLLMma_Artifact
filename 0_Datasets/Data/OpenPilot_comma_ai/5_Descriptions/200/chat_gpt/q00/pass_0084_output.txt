NO

The image provided appears to show a car in a setting where there is no visible precipitation such as heavy rain or snow, and there is no apparent fog or other adverse weather conditions that would significantly impair visibility. Instead, it seems to be a clear but dark or dusk time setting where the car's rear lights are illuminated, indicating low light conditions but not necessarily poor visibility due to weather.
