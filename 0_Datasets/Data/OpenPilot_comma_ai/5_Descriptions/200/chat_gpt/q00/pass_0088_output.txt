NO.

The image appears to be taken at night, which naturally reduces visibility compared to daytime. However, there are no clear indicators of heavy rain, snow, fog, or other adverse weather conditions that are significantly impacting visibility. The road is visible, and lights can be seen in the distance without a visible obstruction, suggesting the absence of severe weather impairments in the photo.
