NO

The image you've provided is too dark and lacking detail to definitively assess whether poor visibility is due to weather conditions. There's no visible precipitation or fog, so we can't attribute the poor visibility to heavy rain, snow, or fog based on this image alone. It might simply be dark outside or the image is underexposed.
