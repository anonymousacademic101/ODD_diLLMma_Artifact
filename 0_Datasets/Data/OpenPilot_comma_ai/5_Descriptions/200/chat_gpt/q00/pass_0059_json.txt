The image might be taken indoors or through a window, and the lack of clarity appears to be due to the quality of the photo or a focus issue, rather than weather-related visibility problems. It's important to note that providing an accurate description requires more context that is not available in the image itself."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
