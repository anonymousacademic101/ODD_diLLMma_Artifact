NO.

The image does not show any signs of heavy rain, snow, fog, or adverse weather conditions that would lead to poor visibility. The environment appears clear. However, the photo's exposure seems unbalanced, with areas appearing overly bright or underexposed, which affects the visibility of the photo itself, but this is a photographic issue rather than actual weather conditions.
