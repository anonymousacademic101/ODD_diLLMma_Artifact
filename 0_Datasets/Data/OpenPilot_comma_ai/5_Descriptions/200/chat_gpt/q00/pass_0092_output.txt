The image appears to be taken in low light conditions, with minimal visibility, which may suggest it was taken at night or under adverse weather conditions that obscure visibility. The elements in the image are not clear, and there might be some occurrence of light scattering, which can happen in fog or heavy rain, although one cannot definitively conclude the specific type of adverse weather from this image alone.
