The image appears to be taken at night, and while the visibility is limited due to darkness, there is no visible precipitation like heavy rain or snow, nor is there any apparent fog or other adverse weather conditions that are visibly affecting the scene. The road markings are clear and there is no distortion that would suggest poor visibility due to weather conditions.
