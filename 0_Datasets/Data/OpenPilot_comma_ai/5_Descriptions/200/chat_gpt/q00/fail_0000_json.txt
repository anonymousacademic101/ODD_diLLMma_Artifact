Visibility is poor due to the darkness and lack of adequate lighting in the scene, which makes it difficult to discern details. There's no clear evidence of precipitation such as rain or snow, and fog is not distinctly visible either. Thus, the reason for poor visibility appears to be the low light conditions rather than weather phenomena."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
