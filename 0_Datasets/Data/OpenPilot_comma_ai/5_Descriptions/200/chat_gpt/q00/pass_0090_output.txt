The image appears to be taken at night, which naturally reduces visibility due to the lack of daylight, but there do not seem to be any additional adverse weather conditions such as heavy rain, snow, or fog present that would further impair visibility. The taillights and streetlights are visible without significant distortion or obstruction, which suggests that visibility is primarily affected by it being nighttime rather than inclement weather.
