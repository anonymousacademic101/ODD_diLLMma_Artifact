NO.

The image provided appears to be of an indoor scene, and the visibility issue seems related to the quality of the photograph or the condition of the glass tank rather than outdoor adverse weather conditions like heavy rain, snow, or fog. The edges of items in the image are not sharp, and there is a uni-directional blurring effect that suggests some kind of photographic anomaly or issue with the glass of the tank that's in the foreground, rather than an environmental visibility problem.
