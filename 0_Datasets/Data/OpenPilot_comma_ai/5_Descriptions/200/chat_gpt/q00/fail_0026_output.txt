The image has poor visibility, but it does not appear to be caused by heavy rain, snow, fog, or other adverse weather conditions. The blurriness looks more like a result of motion blur or a camera that was out of focus when the picture was taken. There are no visible raindrops, snowflakes, or foggy conditions that would imply weather-related poor visibility.
