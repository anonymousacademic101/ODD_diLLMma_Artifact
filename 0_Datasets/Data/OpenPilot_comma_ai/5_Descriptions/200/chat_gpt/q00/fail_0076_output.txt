The image appears to be of low quality or taken in low light conditions, making it difficult to discern details clearly. However, there are no visible signs of heavy rain, snow, fog, or other adverse weather conditions that inherently reduce visibility. The lack of clarity seems to stem from the quality of the image itself rather than weather-related issues.
