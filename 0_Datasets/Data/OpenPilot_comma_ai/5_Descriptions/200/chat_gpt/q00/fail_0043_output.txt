The image quality is not optimal; it appears to be either blurry or taken with a low-resolution camera at night, which may give the impression of poor visibility. However, this does not necessarily indicate the presence of heavy rain, snow, fog, or adverse weather conditions. Visibility issues in this image seem more related to the quality of the image itself rather than the actual atmospheric conditions.
