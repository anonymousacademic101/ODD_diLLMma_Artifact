YES.

The image appears to have poor visibility, which could be indicative of night time conditions with limited artificial illumination or other factors that reduce visibility such as weather conditions. It is difficult to determine the exact cause of the reduced visibility without further context, but the overall lighting and clarity of the image suggest that visibility is not optimal.
