The image appears to be taken at night, and while it is dark, there doesn't seem to be any heavy rain, snow, fog, or other specific adverse weather conditions significantly affecting visibility. Street lights and reflective road markings are visible, and the darkness is consistent with typical night-time conditions rather than a weather event.
