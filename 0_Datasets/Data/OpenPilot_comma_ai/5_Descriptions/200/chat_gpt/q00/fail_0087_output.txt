The image appears to be taken at night or in very low light conditions, which inherently reduces visibility. However, it's not clear if the poor visibility is directly caused by heavy rain, snow, fog, or specific adverse weather conditions, since these are not visibly identifiable in the image. The lack of clear visibility may be due more to the low lighting than the weather.
