The image provided is of low quality and has a narrow field of view, focusing on the back of a vehicle with rather dim lighting. However, there's no clear evidence of heavy rain, snow, fog, or other adverse weather conditions actively impairing visibility. Rather, the low quality of the image itself is the reason for the appearance of potential visibility issues.
