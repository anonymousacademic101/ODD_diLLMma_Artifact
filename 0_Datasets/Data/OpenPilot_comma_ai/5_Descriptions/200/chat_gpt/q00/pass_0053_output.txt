NO

The image shows a scene with no evident heavy rain, snow, fog, or adverse weather conditions that would significantly impair visibility. Although it appears to be nighttime, which naturally reduces visibility, the road is still clearly visible, and there is no sign of weather conditions that would further reduce visibility such as precipitation or fog. The lights on the side of the road and any reflective surfaces are not obscured, which would be the case in poor visibility conditions caused by weather.
