NO

This image does not appear to have poor visibility due to heavy rain, snow, fog, or adverse weather conditions. It looks like the image is taken at night, which may explain the lower visibility as the darkness itself can limit how far one can see. However, there are no clear visual indicators such as raindrops, snowflakes, foggy conditions, or other signs of adverse weather that would suggest poor visibility conditions in the image presented.
