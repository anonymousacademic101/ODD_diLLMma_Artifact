The image is too dark and obscured to accurately assess the visibility in terms of weather conditions. It appears to be severely underexposed, showing a view of a dark ceiling or structure with some light at the bottom, rather than depicting an outdoor scene with weather-related visibility issues. Visibility in terms of weather conditions like rain, snow, or fog cannot be determined from this image.
