The reason for the poor visibility in this image does not appear to be due to heavy rain, snow, fog, or adverse weather conditions. Instead, the image seems to be of low quality or taken in low light conditions without proper camera settings, resulting in motion blur and lack of detail. The darkness and blur in the image might affect the clarity, but these do not indicate inclement weather conditions.
