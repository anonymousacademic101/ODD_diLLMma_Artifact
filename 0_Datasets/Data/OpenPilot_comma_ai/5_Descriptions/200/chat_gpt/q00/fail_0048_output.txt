The image provided is blurry and lacks clear details, which may give an impression of poor visibility. However, the blurriness seems to be caused by a low-quality image or motion blur rather than adverse weather conditions like heavy rain, snow, or fog. Therefore, the low visibility is not due to environmental conditions but rather to the quality of the image itself.
