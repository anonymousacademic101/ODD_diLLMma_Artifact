However, there's no obvious evidence of heavy rain, snow, fog, or other types of severe weather conditions that would be categorized as causing poor visibility. The road markings and lights from distant vehicles are discernible, suggesting that visibility, while limited due to it being nighttime, is not significantly impaired by adverse weather conditions."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
