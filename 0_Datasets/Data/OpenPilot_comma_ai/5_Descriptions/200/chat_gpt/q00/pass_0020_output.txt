No.

The image provided shows a road with clear visibility. There is no evidence of heavy rain, snow, fog, or other adverse weather conditions that would significantly impair visibility. The lighting conditions appear to be dim, possibly suggesting the image was taken during the evening or early morning, but this does not constitute poor visibility due to weather.
