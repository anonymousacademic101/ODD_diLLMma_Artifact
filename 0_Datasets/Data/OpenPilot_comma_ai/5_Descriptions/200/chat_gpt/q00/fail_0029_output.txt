NO

The image does not appear to exhibit poor visibility due to heavy rain, snow, fog, or other adverse weather conditions. It simply seems to be a low-resolution image or could be taken at an angle or in such a manner that there's little context and detail to accurately assess the environmental conditions. Visibility limitations here appear to be due more to the quality of the image itself rather than weather-related factors.
