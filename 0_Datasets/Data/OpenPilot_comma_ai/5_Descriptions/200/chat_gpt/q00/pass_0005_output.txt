The image does not appear to show poor visibility due to heavy rain, snow, fog, or adverse weather conditions. The visibility seems clear as the rear of a vehicle is visible with legible license plate details. However, the image itself may be of low quality or taken under low light conditions, which can affect the overall clarity.
