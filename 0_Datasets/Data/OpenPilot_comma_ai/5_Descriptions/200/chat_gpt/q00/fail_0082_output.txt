NO.

The image does not depict poor visibility due to weather conditions like heavy rain, snow, or fog. Instead, it appears to be a low-light or nighttime photo which is inherently dark and lacks clarity, but this is not due to adverse weather conditions. The visibility issues in the image stem from the low lighting conditions rather than weather effects.
