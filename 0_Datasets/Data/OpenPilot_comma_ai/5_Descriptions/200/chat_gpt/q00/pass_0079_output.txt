The image does not depict an outdoor setting where we would expect to encounter weather conditions like heavy rain, snow, or fog affecting visibility. Instead, the image appears to be of an indoor setting with low lighting, making it difficult to clearly discern the contents, which implies the visibility issue is due to lighting conditions rather than weather.
