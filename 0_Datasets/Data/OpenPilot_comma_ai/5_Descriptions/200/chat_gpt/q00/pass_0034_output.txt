The image appears to be taken at night with limited visibility, as the environment is pretty dark and details are not easily discernible. It is not clear whether the limited visibility is due to weather conditions or just nighttime darkness, but there is a visible glare on the road that suggests there might be wet conditions, potentially indicative of recent rain. This reduced visibility could be considered an adverse condition for driving or outdoor activities.
