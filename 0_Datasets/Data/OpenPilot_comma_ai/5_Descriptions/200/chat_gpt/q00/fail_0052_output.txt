The reason for poor visibility in the image provided seems to be related to the technical quality of the image itself, rather than weather conditions like heavy rain, snow, or fog. The image appears to be blurry and possibly taken with low-light conditions or a low-quality camera, rather than depicting an environment with adverse weather that is affecting visibility.
