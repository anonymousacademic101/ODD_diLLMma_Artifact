The road appears to be curving gently to the right, as indicated by the lane markings and the shape of the road ahead. However, the sign visible in the image also suggests there is a left curve following the initial right curve. The term "sharp curve" typically denotes a more sudden change in direction, which is not clearly evident from this segment of the road.
