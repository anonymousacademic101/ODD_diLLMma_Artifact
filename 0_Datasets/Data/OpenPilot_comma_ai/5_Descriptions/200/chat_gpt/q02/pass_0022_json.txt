The visible lanes and road markings suggest that the road is relatively straight in this section, although there is a slight bend in the distance. However, this bend does not qualify as a "sharp curve" as it seems to be a gentle curve and the road ahead can be seen continuing in a similar direction.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
