NO.

The road ahead does not show a sharp curve; it appears to be relatively straight with only a gentle bend visible in the distance. The lanes are well-marked, and traffic seems to be flowing straight ahead. A sharp curve would be characterized by a more sudden and drastic change in the road's direction.
