NO.

The image is blurred and lacks clear detail, making it difficult to confidently assess the curvature of the road. However, based on the visible information, there is no definitive indication of a sharp curve, just some hints of a potential bend in the road given the lines on the road appear to bend slightly to the left. Without clearer visual evidence or context, it cannot be conclusively stated that the road is on a sharp curve.
