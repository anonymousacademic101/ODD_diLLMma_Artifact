The visible road markings and the direction in which the vehicles are oriented suggest that there is a curve in the road ahead. The lanes appear to bend to the right, indicating a turn or curve in that direction. Additionally, the guardrail on the left side of the image also follows a curved path, reinforcing the presence of a curve in the roadway.
