The image provided is too blurred and lacks clear context to definitively determine the curvature of the road. There is no visible delineation of the road's edges or lines that would indicate its shape or the presence of a turn. It appears to be a night scene with vehicles, but without a clearer view, it is not possible to accurately assess the road's layout.
