The image shows a section of the road with a curved line, indicating a bend, but "sharp curve" generally implies a more pronounced or sudden change in direction, which cannot be determined from this section of the road alone. More context or a wider angle showing the curvature of the road ahead would be needed to characterize the curve as "sharp."
