The road in the image does not appear to be a sharp curve. It seems to be intersecting with a crosswalk, suggesting a more typical intersection rather than a sharp curve. The painted lines on the road indicate pedestrian crossing areas and possibly a stop line for vehicles, which are typically found at intersections, not on sharp curves.
