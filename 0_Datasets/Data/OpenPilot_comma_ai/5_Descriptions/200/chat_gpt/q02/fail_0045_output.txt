NO.

The image provided is blurry and does not clearly show whether there is a sharp curve or not. Based on the visible elements, such as the road lines and the light patterns, there is no strong indication of a sharp curve. However, without a broader view and a clearer image, it is difficult to definitively determine the curvature of the road. The limited field of view doesn't allow for a complete analysis of the road's layout.
