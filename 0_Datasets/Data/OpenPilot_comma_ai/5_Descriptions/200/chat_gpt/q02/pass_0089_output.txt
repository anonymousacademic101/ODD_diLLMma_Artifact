NO.

The road in the image appears to be curving slightly to the right, but it does not constitute a sharp curve. A sharp curve would have a more acute angle and would typically be indicated by road signs warning of the sharp turn ahead. In the image provided, the curvature of the road seems gentle and part of a normal highway or road curve, not a sharp turn.
