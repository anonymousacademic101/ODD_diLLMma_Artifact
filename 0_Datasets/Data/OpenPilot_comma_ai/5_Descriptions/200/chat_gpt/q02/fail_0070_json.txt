The road markings show arrows for straight and right-turning traffic, which typically means that the road itself is not curving sharply but rather intersecting with another road where drivers have the option to turn. Sharp curves on roads would not typically have such markings; instead, they might have warning signs or arrows indicating the curve's direction ahead."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
