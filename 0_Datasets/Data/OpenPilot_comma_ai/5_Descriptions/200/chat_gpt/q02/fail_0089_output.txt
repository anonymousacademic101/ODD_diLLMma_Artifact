NO.

I cannot definitively determine the curvature of the road from the image provided. The image is blurry and lacks clear reference points which would indicate the degree of curvature of the road, if any. It seems to depict an overexposed nighttime scene with car lights, but does not provide sufficient visual information on the geometry of the road's surface.
