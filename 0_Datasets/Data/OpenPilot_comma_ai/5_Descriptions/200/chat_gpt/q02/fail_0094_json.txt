Sharp curves are typically characterized by a very tight radius, causing a more sudden change in direction. The curve in the image seems to be more gradual, and therefore not sharp. However, without a broader view, it is not possible to definitively determine the curvature beyond the visible area.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
