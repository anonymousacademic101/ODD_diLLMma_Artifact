The image shows a vehicle parked adjacent to what appears to be a sidewalk, suggesting this is a parking area or a section of road by the curb, rather than the middle of a sharp curve. The visible lines on the ground also do not indicate the typical markings one would expect to see on a road that is curving sharply.
