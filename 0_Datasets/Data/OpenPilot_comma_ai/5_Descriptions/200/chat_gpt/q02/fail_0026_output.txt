NO.

The image appears to be blurry and it's difficult to gauge the curvature of the road with precision. However, what we can interpret from the visible traffic cones and lights suggests there may be a turn or a section of road that is sectioned off rather than a natural sharp curve on the road. It is not possible to confirm the shape of the road accurately due to the lack of clarity in the image.
