The image shows a road that appears to be gently curving rather than having a sharp curve. The visibility is limited due to nighttime driving conditions, but from the visible portion of the road, the curve does not seem abrupt or tight, and the lane markings guide in a gentle arc, indicating a more gradual turn.
