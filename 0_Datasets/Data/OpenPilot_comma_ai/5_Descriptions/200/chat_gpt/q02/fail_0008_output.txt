The image provided is of very low resolution and shows only a very small section of a road with limited context, making it impossible to determine the curvature of the road with certainty. What can be seen suggests a potential turn or curve but not necessarily a "sharp" curve. The information is insufficient to make a definitive assessment about the road's curvature.
