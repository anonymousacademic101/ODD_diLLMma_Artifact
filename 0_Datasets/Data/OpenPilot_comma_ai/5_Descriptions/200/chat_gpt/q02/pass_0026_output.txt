NO.

The photo shows a section of a multi-lane road with traffic moving in the same direction. There is a slight bend in the road, but it does not appear to be a sharp curve based on the visible trajectory of the lanes and the positioning of the vehicles which do not suggest a tight turn or a significant change in direction that would characterize a sharp curve.
