NO.

The road in the image appears to be relatively straight with a slight bend to the right in the distance, but it is not a sharp curve. Sharp curves typically have a much more acute angle, which affects the visibility of the road ahead and requires a significant change in direction to navigate. What is visible here does not suggest a sharp curve.
