The image shows a road at night with multiple lanes and visible traffic. The lane markings are straight and there does not appear to be any immediate sharp curvature in the road ahead within the field of view of the image. The vehicles are aligned in a manner suggestive of straight-line movement rather than navigating a sharp turn.
