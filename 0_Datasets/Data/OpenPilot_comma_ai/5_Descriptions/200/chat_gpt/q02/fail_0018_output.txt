The image provided is blurry and shows a vehicle in motion, making it difficult to definitively determine the curvature of the road. However, from the visible angle and the portion of the road seen in the background, we cannot see a sharp curve. Instead, it seems like the car is in the middle of a turn or in motion, without enough information to classify the road as having a sharp curve.
