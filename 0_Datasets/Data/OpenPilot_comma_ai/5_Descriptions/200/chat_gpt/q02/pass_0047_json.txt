The visible lane markings are relatively straight, and no abrupt directional changes can be observed in the portion of the road that's visible. However, due to the limitations of the picture's scope and the darkness in the setting, it's not possible to definitively state the wider nature of the road beyond the captured area. The curve, if any, appears to be gentle within the illuminated section of roadway."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
