NO.

The road in the image is curving, but it does not appear to be a "sharp" curve. The bend in the road is gentle and can be driven at regular highway speeds without requiring significant reduction in speed or maneuvering that would be associated with sharper curves. The term "sharp curve" usually refers to a turn with a much tighter radius that would necessitate a considerable decrease in speed to navigate safely.
