NO.

While the image quality is not the best, it appears that the road has a gentle bend rather than a sharp curve. The visible road surface suggests a curved trajectory, but it does not seem sharp or abrupt. A sharp curve would typically imply a more significant and immediate change in direction, which is not evident in the portion of the road we can see in this image.
