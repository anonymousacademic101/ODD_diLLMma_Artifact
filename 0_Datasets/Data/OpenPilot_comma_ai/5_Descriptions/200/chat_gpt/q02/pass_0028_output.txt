NO.

The road ahead seems to gradually veer to the right rather than form a sharp curve. The vehicles on the road are aligned in a way that suggests they are following a gentle curve, and there are no sharp angle changes visible in the road's direction within the current field of view. Sharp curves typically require visible changes in direction that are more abrupt than what is shown here.
