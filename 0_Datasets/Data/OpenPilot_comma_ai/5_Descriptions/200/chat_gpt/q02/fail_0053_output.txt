NO.

Based on the visible fragment of the road in the image, it appears to be relatively straight within the scope of the view. The road surface doesn't show any immediate sharp curvature, and there's no evident aggressive bending of the road lines or edges that would suggest a sharp curve. However, it is important to note that this assessment is limited to the portion of the road visible in the image, and conditions may change beyond this frame.
