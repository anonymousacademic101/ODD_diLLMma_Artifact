NO.

The image shows a road with a slight bend rather than a sharp curve. There is a warning sign indicating a curve ahead, but the portion of the road visible in the image does not appear to have a sharp turn. The curve seems gentle and the road can be seen continuing without a sharp deviation in direction within the current field of view.
