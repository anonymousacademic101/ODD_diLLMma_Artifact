NO.

The image shows a section of a road with parked cars and a visible bend, but based on the visible portion, it does not appear to be a "sharp" curve. Sharp curves are typically characterized by a very tight radius, causing a more sudden change in direction. The curve in the image seems to be more gradual, and therefore not sharp. However, without a broader view, it is not possible to definitively determine the curvature beyond the visible area.
