YES.

The visible road markings and the curvature of the lines suggest that the road is indeed taking a sharp turn. The markings appear to be arrows that indicate a left turn, and these arrows bend sharply in the direction of the turn, indicating that the curve in the road is significant. Moreover, the perspective of the image also suggests that the road bends beyond the immediate field of view, reinforcing the perception that the curve is sharp.
