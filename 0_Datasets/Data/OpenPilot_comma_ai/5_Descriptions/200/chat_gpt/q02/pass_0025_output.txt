NO.

The image shows a road that appears to be curving gently to the right rather than a sharp curve. The visible lane markings and the positioning of the cars suggest a smooth transition in the road's direction. Sharp curves typically require significant steering adjustment and often have warning signs or arrows prominently displayed, which are not visible here.
