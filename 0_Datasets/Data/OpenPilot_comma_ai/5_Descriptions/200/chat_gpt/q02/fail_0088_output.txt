NO.

The road in the image does not appear to be on a sharp curve. Instead, it seems to go straight ahead, with the crosswalk lines perpendicular to the direction of travel, suggesting a straight path rather than a curve. Additionally, the road markings do not indicate a curve, and the "RIGHT TURN SIGNAL" sign also suggests an intersection rather than a sharp curve.
