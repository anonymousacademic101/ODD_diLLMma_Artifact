The road in the image appears to be curving to the left, and the angle of the curve seems quite pronounced, which would qualify it as a sharp curve. The solid yellow line on the road indicates that it's a no-passing zone, which is commonly the case in areas where there are sharp bends due to limited visibility of oncoming traffic.
