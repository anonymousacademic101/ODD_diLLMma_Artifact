The road ahead does not appear to consist of a sharp curve. The lines on the road suggest that it continues straight for the visible distance, with only a slight bend or curve that is not sharp. Sharp curves are usually characterized by a significant change in direction over a short distance and are often accompanied by warning signs, none of which are visible in the image provided.
