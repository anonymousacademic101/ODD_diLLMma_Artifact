Based on the image provided, the road appears to be relatively straight in the immediate section ahead as viewed from the perspective of the driver. The lane markings suggest a straight path, and there is no visible sharp curving of the road within the scope of the headlights. However, without seeing further down the road, it is impossible to determine if there may be a sharp curve beyond the illuminated area.
