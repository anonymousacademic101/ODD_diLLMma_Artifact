NO.

The image shows a section of a road with visible painted lines that create a crossing pattern suggesting that this is an intersection rather than a sharp curve. The road markings are designed to guide vehicular traffic through the intersection safely and indicate areas for pedestrian crossing, which would not be present on a section of the road characterized by a sharp curve. Additionally, the visible part of the road does not exhibit any pronounced curvature that would indicate a sharp bend.
