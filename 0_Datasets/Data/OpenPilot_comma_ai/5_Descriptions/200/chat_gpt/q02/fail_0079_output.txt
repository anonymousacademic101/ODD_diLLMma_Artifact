The image is highly blurred and details are not clear, which would be consistent with motion blur during a sharp turn at a high speed. Furthermore, the angle and curvature of the visible lines that could be interpreted as road markings suggest a curve. However, without a clearer image or additional context, this assessment can't be definite.
