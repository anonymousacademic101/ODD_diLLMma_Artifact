NO.

The image shows a road that seems to be curving to the right, but I cannot determine whether it's a sharp curve based on the limited perspective and the darkness in the image. From the visible information, it appears to be a gentle curve rather than a sharp one. The curvature doesn't seem abrupt; rather, it seems gradual, leading to the right with a wide arc which typically indicates a milder curve.
