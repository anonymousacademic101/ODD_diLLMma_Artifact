NO.

The road shown in the image does not appear to be on a sharp curve. The visible lane markings and trajectory of the road suggest a gentle curve or a road that is mostly straight in the immediate field of view. Sharp curves are typically indicated by tighter angles and more drastic changes in the direction of the road, which are not evident in this image.
