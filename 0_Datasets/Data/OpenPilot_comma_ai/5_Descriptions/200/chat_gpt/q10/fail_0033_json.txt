There is an individual riding an electric scooter in a crosswalk. They are crossing the street, and drivers should yield to pedestrians and individuals using mobility devices like scooters in crosswalks.\n\n2. The pedestrian/mobility crosswalk has a typical yellow and white pattern indicating the crossing point on the road surface.\n\n3. On the roadside, there is a sign for "METRO TRANS Bus Transport" and a phone number, indicating it may be related to a local public transportation service. The sign also states "NOW HIRING Class B," suggesting they\'re recruiting for positions requiring a Class B commercial driver\'s license.\n\n4. The lighting in the image suggests it might be daytime, but the exact time of day is unclear.\n\n5. Traffic conditions cannot be fully assessed due to the limited field of view, but there are no immediately obvious vehicles close to the intersection where the individual is crossing.\n\n6. No traffic lights or other road signs are clearly visible in this particular section of the image.\n\n7. There are no visible indications of the weather being a factor for drivers to consider in this image, although the lighting and road surface look clear and dry. \n\nDrivers should be attentive to pedestrians and individuals on scooters, particularly when they are crossing within a marked crosswalk as depicted in the image.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
