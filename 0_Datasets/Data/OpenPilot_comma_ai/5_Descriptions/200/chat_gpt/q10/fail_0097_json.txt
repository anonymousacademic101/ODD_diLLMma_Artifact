The road is asphalt and has lane markings, including a curved white line indicating that there is a turning lane. There are no visible road signs, traffic signals, or pedestrians in this particular frame.\n\nOn the road, there are at least two vehicles visibleâ€”one parked on the side of the street, and another further away, which appears to be in motion, possibly driving away from the viewer. The shadows suggest it could be a sunny day and, judging by the direction and length of the shadows, it might be in the late afternoon.\n\nDrivers approaching this intersection should pay attention to the following: checking for any road signs or signals that might be just out of view, watching for pedestrians who might be crossing or preparing to cross the street (though none are visible at the moment), and noting the parked car to their right which could potentially obstruct the view or movement of crossing traffic or pedestrians. Additionally, the turning lane should be used only if the driver intends to turn, and they must signal appropriately.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
