The word "STOP" is written in white lettering and appears to be in the standard style used in many countries, particularly in the United States. The letters are capitalized and painted in a way that they are readable for drivers approaching the intersection, which suggests that the viewpoint of the image is from a vehicle on the road.\n\nThe road has a solid double yellow line in the center indicating that passing is not permitted in either direction. There\'s also a single white line near the edge of the road, which is a common lane marker used to indicate the boundary of the lane. \n\nOn the right side, there is a curb and what appears to be foliage or low-lying greenery, indicative of a landscaped area by the roadside. There are no visible pedestrians, other traffic, or road signs within the field of view of this image. Additionally, there\'s a tall wall or fence beyond the landscaped area, creating a barrier between the road and whatever lies beyond.\n\nIt\'s not possible to accurately determine the time of day as there are no shadows or significant lighting cues in the image, but it looks overcast or might be a shaded area. For those driving on this road, it is important to observe the stop marking on the road, come to a full stop at the stop line, and proceed only when safe to do so, following all traffic regulations that apply at this type of intersection.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
