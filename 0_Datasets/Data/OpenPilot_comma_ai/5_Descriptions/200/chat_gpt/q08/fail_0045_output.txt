The road in the image appears to be a straight stretch and there is no evidence from this perspective that it is particularly narrow or winding. The visible lane markings suggest a standard, multiple-lane road which is generally designed to handle a fair amount of traffic, typically not characteristic of narrow, winding roads which often have limited space and tighter turns.
