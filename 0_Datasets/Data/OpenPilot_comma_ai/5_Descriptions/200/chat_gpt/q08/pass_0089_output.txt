The road in the image appears to be a multi-lane road with relatively straight segments visible in the field of view. The lanes are marked and there is a clear separation between directions of traffic, as well as multiple cars visible in various lanes, indicating it is not narrow. There are no sharp turns or bends observable in the immediate view which would indicate a winding road.
