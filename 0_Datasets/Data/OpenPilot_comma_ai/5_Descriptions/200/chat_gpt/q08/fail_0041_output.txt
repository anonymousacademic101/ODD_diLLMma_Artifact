The image provided does not offer enough context to determine the characteristics of the road. We can only see a fragment of a space that looks like a section of a road or an area adjacent to a building, without a view of the road's layout, length, or surrounding environment. Hence, it cannot be conclusively said whether the road is narrow and winding.
