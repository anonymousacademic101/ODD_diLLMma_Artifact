NO

The road in the image appears to be a straight stretch without immediate signs of winding turns. There is no visible evidence of it being particularly narrow as the lanes seem to be of standard width for a typical road or highway, with visible lane markings. It is difficult to make out the full scope of the road due to the darkness and lighting conditions, but based on what can be seen, the road doesn't exhibit characteristics of being narrow and winding.
