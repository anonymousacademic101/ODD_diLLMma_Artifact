The image shows a street that appears to be straight and broad enough to accommodate multiple lanes of traffic and parked vehicles on the side. There are no evident curves or bends that would classify it as "winding," nor does the available width suggest that it is "narrow." The visible road markings indicate a crossing, and the context implies an urban setting typically associated with wider roads.
