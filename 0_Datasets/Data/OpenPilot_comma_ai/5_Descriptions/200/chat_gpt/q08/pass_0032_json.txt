The visible lane markings and separation between the lanes indicate it is a road built to accommodate multiple vehicles side by side, characteristic of a wider road. Moreover, the lack of sharp turns or bends in the section of the road that we can see leads to the conclusion that it is not a winding road in this area.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
