The road appears to be a multi-lane road with markings that suggest it is designed for higher-speed traffic, which typically implies that it is not narrow. Additionally, from the straight stretch visible in the image, we cannot determine if it is winding beyond the field of view, but it does not exhibit immediate winding characteristics in the visible section.
