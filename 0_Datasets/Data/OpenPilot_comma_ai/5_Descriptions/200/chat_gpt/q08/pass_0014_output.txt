The image shows a road at night with insufficient lighting to clearly determine its width or curvature. Based on the visible portion, the road appears to be straight rather than winding, and there are multiple lanes with parked cars on the side, suggesting it is not particularly narrow. However, due to the darkness and limited perspective, a definitive assessment of the road's characteristics cannot be made.
