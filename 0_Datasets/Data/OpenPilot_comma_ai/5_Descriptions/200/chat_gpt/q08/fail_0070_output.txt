The image shows a section of road with painted directional arrows, which suggests organization for traffic flow. Although the full context of the road is not visible, the visible section does not indicate that the road is narrow and winding. It appears to be a typical city or suburban street with enough width for at least two lanes of traffic and parking spaces at the side. There are no visible curves or bends in this section of the road to suggest it is winding.
