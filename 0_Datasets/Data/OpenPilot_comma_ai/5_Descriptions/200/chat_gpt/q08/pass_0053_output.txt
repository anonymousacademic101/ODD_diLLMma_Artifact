NO.

The road in the image does not appear to be particularly narrow or winding. It seems to be a multi-lane road with visible lane markings, and the immediate stretch of road visible is mostly straight with a gentle curve in the distance. Additionally, there appears to be a sign indicating an exit or junction ahead, which is typical of wider roads designed to manage higher volumes of traffic.
