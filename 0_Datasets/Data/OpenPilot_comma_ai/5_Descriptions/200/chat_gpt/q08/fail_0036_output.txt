The road in the image appears to be a multi-lane road with clear markings, including a median strip and space for cars to park or move about, which suggests it is neither narrow nor winding. Winding roads are characterized by frequent turns and changes in direction, and narrow roads typically have less width to accommodate traffic, neither of which are evident in this image.
