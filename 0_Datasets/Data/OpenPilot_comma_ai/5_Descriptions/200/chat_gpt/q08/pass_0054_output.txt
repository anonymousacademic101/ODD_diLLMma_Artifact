YES.

The road in the image appears to be winding, as indicated by the curve of the lane lines and the path of the road leading into darkness. It is more challenging to assess the narrowness definitively due to the angle and lighting of the image, but the road does not seem to have multiple lanes for each direction, which might suggest it is relatively narrow compared to a multi-lane highway. Additionally, roads that are winding are often found in locations where they cannot be wide due to geographical constraints.
