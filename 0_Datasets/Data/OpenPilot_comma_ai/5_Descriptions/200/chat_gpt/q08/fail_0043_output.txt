NO

The image does not provide a clear enough view to definitively determine the characteristics of the road in terms of its width or whether it is winding. From what can be observed, the section of the road or path directly visible in the image appears to be relatively straight, and no winding path can be discerned. Additionally, the perspective is limited, and there is no indication of the road's width relative to typical road standards for narrowness.
