NO.

The road in the image appears to be a straight urban street. There are no visible curves or bends that would indicate it is winding. The street width seems standard for a city road, with enough space for cars to be parked on both sides and at least one lane for driving in the middle. It does not appear to be particularly narrow compared to typical city streets.
