NO.

The road in the image appears to be a multi-lane bridge with sufficient width for multiple vehicles to travel simultaneously in the same direction without restrictions. The lanes are well-marked and the surface is straight in the visible section, without any immediate sharp bends or twists that would characterize a "winding" road. The structure and design of the bridge suggest that it is built to accommodate steady traffic flow and is not narrow.
