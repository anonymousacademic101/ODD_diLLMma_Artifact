I cannot provide a definitive answer based on the provided image because it shows only a small, possibly cropped section of a road. This section alone does not allow me to discern the overall nature of the road, specifically whether it is narrow and winding. For an accurate assessment, a broader or more comprehensive view of the road would be necessary.
