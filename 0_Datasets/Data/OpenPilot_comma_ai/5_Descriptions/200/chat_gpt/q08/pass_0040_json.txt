The width of the road, indicated by the clear lane demarcations, suggests that it is not narrow but of a standard width appropriate for vehicular traffic. The road also features reflectors or road studs along the lane marking, which typically indicate a road designed for safe travel at higher speeds, commonly found on wider, straight roads rather than narrow and winding ones.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
