NO.

The road in the image appears to be a standard, straight road with marked lanes and does not exhibit the characteristics of a narrow or winding road. It looks adequately wide for vehicular traffic with clear lane demarcations, and the immediate stretch visible in the picture shows no tight bends or curves that would classify it as winding.
