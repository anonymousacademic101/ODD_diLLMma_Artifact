No.

The image provided does not show a road that is narrow and winding. It appears to depict a section of a road that is relatively straight and wide enough to accommodate multiple lanes of traffic, with a gas station visible on the side. There's no visible evidence of tight bends or the kind of sinuous road layout that would be described as "winding."
