NO.

The image shows a view of a road at night with limited visibility due to the image's angle and lighting conditions. However, from the visible segment, it does not appear to be particularly narrow or winding; rather, it looks like a standard-width road with a curve or corner that is not sharply winding. The road looks properly paved with markings, indicating it is a regular urban or suburban road rather than a narrow, winding country road. Additionally, there is a sign that seems to be indicating a turn or junction ahead, but the specific conditions beyond this section cannot be confirmed from this image alone.
