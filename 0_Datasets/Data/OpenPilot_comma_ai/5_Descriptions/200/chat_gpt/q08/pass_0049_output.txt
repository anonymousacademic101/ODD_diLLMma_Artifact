NO.

The road in the image appears to be straight and there are no visible twists or turns that would indicate it is winding. Additionally, the road does not seem particularly narrow as it provides enough space for at least one lane of traffic, and potentially more, suggesting it is of a standard width for a road. There is also a lack of context to indicate any immediate narrowness ahead.
