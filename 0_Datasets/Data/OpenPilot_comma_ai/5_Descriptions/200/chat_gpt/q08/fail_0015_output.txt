NO.

Based on the image provided, I can see multiple lanes with cars indicating that it is a typical, wider urban road, not a narrow and winding one. The lanes appear to be straight ahead as can be inferred from the alignment of the vehicles, which do not suggest any immediate curves or winding paths.
