The image shows a car parked beside a curb in an area that appears to be a parking lot or a driveway adjacent to buildings. The visible part of the road does not appear to be narrow or winding. The visible section is straight, and the width seems to be typical for a parking or driveway area, without any evident bends or curves that would suggest it is winding.
