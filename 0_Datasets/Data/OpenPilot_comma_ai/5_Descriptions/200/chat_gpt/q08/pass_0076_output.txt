NO.

The road in the image appears to be a standard two-lane road with one lane for each direction of travel. It does not seem particularly narrow, as it comfortably accommodates the vehicles shown. Additionally, from the visible section of the road, it does not appear to be winding. Instead, it looks quite straight without any sharp curves or bends in the immediate view.
