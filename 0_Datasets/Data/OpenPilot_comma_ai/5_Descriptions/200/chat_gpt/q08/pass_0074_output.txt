NO.

The road in the image appears to be a multi-lane road with clear lane markings and seems to straighten out after a gentle curve. It does not look particularly narrow, as there are multiple lanes for traffic, and though there is a curve visible, it does not appear to be excessively winding. The term "winding" typically refers to a road with numerous bends and turns, which is not depicted here.
