NO.

Based on the image provided, the road appears to be straight rather than winding, and it has multiple lanes, which suggests it is not particularly narrow either. The visible lane markings and separation between the lanes indicate it is a road built to accommodate multiple vehicles side by side, characteristic of a wider road. Moreover, the lack of sharp turns or bends in the section of the road that we can see leads to the conclusion that it is not a winding road in this area.
