NO.

The road in the image appears to be a multi-lane highway with several lanes for traffic in one direction, marked by clear lane lines. This indicates that the road is not narrow. The road also looks relatively straight in the section visible, without any sharp turns or bends that would suggest it is winding. Instead, it seems to be a standard, straight section of a high-capacity road.
