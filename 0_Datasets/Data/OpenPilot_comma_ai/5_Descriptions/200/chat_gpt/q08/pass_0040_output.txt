NO.

The road depicted in the image is straight, with visible lane markings, and there are no visible curvatures or bends that would indicate it is winding. The width of the road, indicated by the clear lane demarcations, suggests that it is not narrow but of a standard width appropriate for vehicular traffic. The road also features reflectors or road studs along the lane marking, which typically indicate a road designed for safe travel at higher speeds, commonly found on wider, straight roads rather than narrow and winding ones.
