YES.

The road in the image appears winding, with visible curves ahead. Although the definition of "narrow" can be subjective, considering road standards, the lane for each direction does seem to be narrower than what might be found on larger multi-lane highways. Therefore, based on observation, the road can be described as both narrow and winding.
