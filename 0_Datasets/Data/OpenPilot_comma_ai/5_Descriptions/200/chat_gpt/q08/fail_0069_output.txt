NO.

The image shows a section of a road with a visible curve and road markings indicating turn lanes. However, based on what's visible, the curve is gentle and the road does not appear to be especially narrow. There is no clear evidence of winding paths, steep elevation changes, or tight switchbacks that would typically characterize a road as narrow and winding. It looks like a standard urban roadway with adequate width for multiple vehicles.
