NO.

The road in the image appears to be a multi-lane highway with a reasonably wide width for each lane, which allows for various vehicles, including larger trucks, to travel comfortably. Additionally, based on the segment of the road visible in the image, there are no tight curves or bends that would make it a winding road. It seems to be a straight portion of a highway.
