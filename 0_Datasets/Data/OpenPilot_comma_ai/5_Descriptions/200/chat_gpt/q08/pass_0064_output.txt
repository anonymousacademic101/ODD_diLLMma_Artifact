YES

The visible stretch of the road ahead appears to be relatively narrow, judging by the proximity of the vehicles parked on the side of the road and the limited space available for maneuvering between them. Additionally, the road seems to be winding, as the pathway ahead is not straight and visibility is limited to a curve ahead, suggesting that the road has bends. However, it's important to note that the assessment is based on this particular snapshot in time, and road conditions may vary beyond what is visible in this image.
