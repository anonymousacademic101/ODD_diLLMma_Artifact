NO.

The road in the image appears to be a wide multi-lane road. There are multiple lanes visible with lane markings, and the road looks straight in the section we can see. There are no visible sharp bends or curves that would indicate it is winding. The presence of traffic signs and overhead lights also suggest it is a well-maintained and likely not a narrow road.
