YES

The part of the road visible in the image shows that there is a curve ahead suggested by the lane lines and the cautionary road sign indicating a bend. However, it's important to note that determining if the road is "narrow" can be subjective and typically refers to the width of the lanes. The image doesn't provide a full perspective on the width, but the fact there is a visible curving path qualifies it to be described as "winding."
