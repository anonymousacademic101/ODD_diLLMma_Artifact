NO.

The image shows a road filled with cars, indicating traffic congestion. It is not possible to determine from this image alone if the road is narrow or winding because the field of view is limited to the immediate traffic ahead. However, this section of the road does not appear to be narrow as multiple lanes of traffic are visible, nor is there any observable evidence of it winding from the visible scene.
