The image is blurry and it's difficult to make a definitive statement about the road's characteristics. However, from the visible cues, it does not appear to be a narrow or winding road. The area shown seems to have multiple lanes with a separation line, suggesting a standard-width urban road. There is no clear evidence of winding curves in the section depicted.
