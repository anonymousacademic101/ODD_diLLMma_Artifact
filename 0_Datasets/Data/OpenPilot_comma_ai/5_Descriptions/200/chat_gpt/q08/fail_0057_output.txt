NO.

The image provided does not give enough context to determine if the road is narrow and winding. The section of the road visible in the image looks straight and contains at least two lanes, suggesting it may not be particularly narrow at this point. However, without visibility of more of the road, it is not possible to definitively say whether this road is generally narrow and winding based on this image alone.
