The image provided appears to be taken at a street crossing with pedestrian markings, indicative of a more urban and structured road rather than a narrow and winding one. A sign indicating a turn or curve is not necessarily indicative of the entire road's nature, and the field of view does not provide evidence of a narrow, winding road ahead.
