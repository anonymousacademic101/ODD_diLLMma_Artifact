NO

The road in the image does not run horizontally across it; rather, it appears to be extending into the distance from the bottom center towards the upper center, indicating that the vehicle is traveling forward on the road, not across the image frame. There are also no visible intersections in this image; it seems to be a stretch of a highway or a similar road without visible cross traffic.
