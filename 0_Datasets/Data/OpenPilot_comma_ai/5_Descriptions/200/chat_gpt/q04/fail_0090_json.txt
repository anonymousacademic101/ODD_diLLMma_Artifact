However, based on the visible cues such as the motion blur and orientation of the vehicles, it does not appear that we are at an intersection. It suggests that the camera is panning quickly, capturing a road that runs horizontally across the frame, as the vehicles seem to be moving from one side to the other, rather than approaching or moving away from the camera's perspective as would often be seen at an intersection."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
