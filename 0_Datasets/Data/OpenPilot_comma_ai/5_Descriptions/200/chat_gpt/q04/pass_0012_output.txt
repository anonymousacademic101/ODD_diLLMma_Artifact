The road runs horizontally across the image. This can be identified by the orientation of the cars and the lane markings, which indicate that the road is viewed from within a lane and the lanes run parallel to the bottom edge of the image, suggesting a horizontal perspective relative to the image's orientation. An intersection would typically involve a view where roads cross each other, or traffic from different directions would be visible, which is not apparent in this image.
