The image provided doesn't allow for a clear determination of the road layout. It's a close-up, blurred image of a portion of a vehicle in motion, without enough context or visual information to ascertain if the road is at an intersection or how it runs across the image. The orientation and larger layout of the road cannot be determined from this segment alone.
