NO.

The image is quite blurry, making it difficult to give a definitive answer. However, based on the broad horizontal lines that can be observed, which are likely to be lane markings, and the lack of any clear signs of an intersection such as traffic lights or multiple crosswalks, it does not appear to show a standard intersection. While there are details that suggest it could be a crosswalk, an intersection typically involves additional features and signage that are not clearly present or discernible in this image. The road in the image appears to run horizontally across the frame.
