The road does not run horizontally across the image; instead, it appears to lead into the scene from the bottom of the image, suggesting that the road is not an intersection and does not run horizontally across the frame in this specific image. However, without further context or a wider view, it isnâ€™t possible to fully determine the road's layout beyond this single frame.
