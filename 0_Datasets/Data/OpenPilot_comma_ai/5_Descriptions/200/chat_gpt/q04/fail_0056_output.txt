The road appears to run horizontally across the image. This can be inferred from the way the shadows are cast on the ground, the orientation of the parked vehicles, and the general perspective of the buildings and the road as viewed in the image. If this were an intersection, you would expect to see road markings or signs indicative of crossing traffic, which do not appear to be present.
