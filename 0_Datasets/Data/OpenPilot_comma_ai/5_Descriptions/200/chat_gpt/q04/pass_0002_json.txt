Your question presents two scenarios as if they are mutually exclusive: being at an intersection or the road running horizontally. The road running horizontally is evident because the image shows the road stretching from the left to the right side of the frame, indicating a horizontal orientation. However, the image does not provide enough context to determine definitively whether we are at an intersection, as an intersection involves multiple crossing or branching paths, and the visible portion of the road does not clearly show such a configuration.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
