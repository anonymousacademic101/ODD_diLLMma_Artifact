NO

The road runs horizontally across the image. We can tell because the curb and sidewalk are situated on one side of the road, which is a typical configuration that runs parallel to the road. There's also a handrail and steps visible, which again aligns with the road horizontally and suggests that the sidewalk leads upwards, perpendicular to the road. Additionally, there is no visible indication of road markings or traffic signals that would suggest this is an intersection.
