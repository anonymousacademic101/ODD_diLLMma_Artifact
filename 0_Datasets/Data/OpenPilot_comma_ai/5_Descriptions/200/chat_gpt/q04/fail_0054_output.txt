The image provided appears to be taken from an angle where the orientation of the road is not clearly discernible. The perspective is tilted and does not give a straightforward view of any road or intersection. Additionally, the image seems to be showing a driveway rather than a road meant for general driving, and thus it would not be categorized as an intersection or running horizontally across the image in the typical sense of roadways.
