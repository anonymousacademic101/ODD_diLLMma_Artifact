The road does not run horizontally across the image; it extends directly away from the perspective of the viewer. This is inferred from the converging lines of the road marking, which suggest a typical two-dimensional perspective drawing where lines converge at a vanishing point on the horizon. The road appears to be a straight stretch rather than an intersection.
