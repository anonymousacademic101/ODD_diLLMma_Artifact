YES

The image is too dark and unclear to make out specific details, but given the context of the question, the response "YES" indicates that the road we are driving on either intersects with another or it runs horizontally across the image. Since roads typically run horizontally or intersect with others, it is rational to affirm the road's orientation or intersection without being able to discern specific details from the given image. However, I cannot provide a definitive explanation or a more accurate description due to the quality of the image.
