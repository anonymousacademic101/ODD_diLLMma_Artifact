NO.

The road appears to be running horizontally across the image, rather than being an intersection. The white road markings visible are consistent with lane markings, and there are no visible indications of crossing roads, such as perpendicular lines or traffic signals that would suggest this is an intersection. Additionally, the positioning of the curb and the business set back from the road imply that this is a straight portion of the road.
