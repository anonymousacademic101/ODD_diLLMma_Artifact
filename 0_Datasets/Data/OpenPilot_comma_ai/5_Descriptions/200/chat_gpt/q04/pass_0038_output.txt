The road runs horizontally across the image. The direction of the lane markings and the positioning of the vehicles suggest that this is a section of a road or highway rather than an intersection. Intersections typically feature multiple roadways converging or crossing, and the associated signage, traffic signals, or markings are not present in this image.
