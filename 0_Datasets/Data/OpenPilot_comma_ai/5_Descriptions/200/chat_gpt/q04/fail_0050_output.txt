The road does not appear to run horizontally across the image; rather, it seems like the perspective of the road is such that it extends into the distance from the bottom of the image toward the horizon, suggesting we are driving along the road, not across it. The image is blurry, which makes it difficult to discern precise details, but the typical perspective of a road while driving is along its length, not horizontally across it.
