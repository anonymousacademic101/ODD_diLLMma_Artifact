The road appears to be an intersection. The marking and parking spaces indicate that the road continues in more than one direction, which is characteristic of an intersection. The image shows lanes that intersect with each other, which provides the necessary visual cues to identify this area as an intersection rather than a road running only horizontally across the image.
