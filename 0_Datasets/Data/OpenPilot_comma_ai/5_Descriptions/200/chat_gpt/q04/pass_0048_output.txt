No.

The road in the image does not appear to be an intersection and does not run horizontally across the image; rather, it seems to be a straight road stretching into the distance from the viewer's perspective. The lane markings lead directly away from the viewpoint, indicating a straight path rather than a horizontal or intersecting one.
