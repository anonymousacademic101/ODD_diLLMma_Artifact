The road does not run horizontally across the image, but rather extends into the distance from the bottom towards the top of the image, indicating that we are looking down a road or bridge rather than at a road running across the image from a horizontal perspective. The lines and perspective suggest that we are moving forward along the road, not observing it from a side view.
