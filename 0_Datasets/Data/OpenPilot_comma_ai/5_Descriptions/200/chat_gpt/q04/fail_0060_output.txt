The road does not appear to run horizontally across the image; instead, it seems to be a perspective view of a street receding into the distance. The lines on the road suggest that it is a section of the street rather than an intersection. The angle and field of view of the image give the impression that the road is extending vertically in the image rather than horizontally.
