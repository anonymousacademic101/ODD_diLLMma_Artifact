NO

The road does not run horizontally across the image. Instead, the perspective of the image shows the road stretching into the distance from the bottom to the center of the image, suggesting a forward motion along the road from the viewer's perspective. The road appears to continue straight rather than across the image, and the lines on the road guide the eye towards the vanishing point in the distance.
