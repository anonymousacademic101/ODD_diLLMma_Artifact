The road we are driving on appears to be part of an intersection, not just running horizontally across the image. There are road markings that typically indicate a pedestrian crossing zone, which commonly occur at intersections, and the presence of vehicles positioned perpendicular to the field of view suggests cross traffic, which is characteristic of an intersection.
