The image shows a road with vehicles aligned in such a way that suggests they are stopped in traffic, likely indicating a horizontal road rather than an intersection. There is no visible cross traffic or traffic signals that would typically indicate an intersection. The cars are parallel to each other, and the perspective of the road indicates it is running horizontally across the image.
