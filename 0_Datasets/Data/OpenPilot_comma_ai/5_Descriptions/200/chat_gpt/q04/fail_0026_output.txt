NO.

The image is blurred and lacks clear details to definitively determine the orientation of the road; however, the configuration suggests a sideways perspective of an area with traffic cones, hinting at the possibility of construction or a detour rather than a road that we are driving on. The question seems to assume motion ("driving on"), but the image does not confirm that we are on a road, nor that it runs horizontally across the image.
