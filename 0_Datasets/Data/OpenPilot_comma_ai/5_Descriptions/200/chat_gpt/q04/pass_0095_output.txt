YES

The road appears to be running horizontally across the image as we see the traffic lanes extending from the bottom of the image towards the horizon, which is indicative of a typical straight road view. There are no clear signs of an intersection such as crossing traffic, traffic lights facing perpendicular to the viewer, or road markings that would indicate such a crossroad within the visible area of the image.
