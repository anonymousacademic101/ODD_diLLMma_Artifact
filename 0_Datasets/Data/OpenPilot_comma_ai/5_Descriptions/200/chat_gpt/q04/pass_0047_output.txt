The road appears to run horizontally across the image, not at an intersection, since we can see the lane markings extending from the bottom to the top of the image continuously, indicating the direction of traffic flow is toward the vanishing point in the image. An intersection would typically show crossing or converging lines indicating the junction of roads.
