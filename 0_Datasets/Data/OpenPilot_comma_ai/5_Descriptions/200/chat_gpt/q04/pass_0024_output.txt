The road appears to run horizontally across the image rather than being an intersection. This perception is due to the fact that the image is tightly cropped and does not provide a comprehensive view of the road layout. However, the visible lines on the road suggest that it is extending horizontally in the frame of the photo. It is important to mention that without a wider view, the presence of an intersection cannot be definitively ruled out, but based on the given section, the road seems to be horizontal.
