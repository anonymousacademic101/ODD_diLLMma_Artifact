The road is not running horizontally across the image, but it seems to be part of an intersection based on the layout and the presence of a vehicle that appears to be traveling perpendicularly to the camera's viewpoint. Intersections typically involve roads that cross at some angle, and the visible car's orientation suggests crossing paths, indicative of an intersection.
