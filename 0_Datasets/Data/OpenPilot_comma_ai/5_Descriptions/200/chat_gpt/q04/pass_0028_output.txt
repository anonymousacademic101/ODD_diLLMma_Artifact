The road runs horizontally across the image from the perspective of the camera. It does not appear to be an intersection based on the visible lanes and the continuous flow of traffic. There are multiple lanes of traffic moving in parallel, which is characteristic of a stretch of road rather than an intersection, which typically involves crossing or converging roads.
