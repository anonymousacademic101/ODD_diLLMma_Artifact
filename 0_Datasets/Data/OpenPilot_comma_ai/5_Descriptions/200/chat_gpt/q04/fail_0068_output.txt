The road in the image appears to run horizontally across the image rather than being an intersection based on the layout seen in the photograph. The viewpoint suggests we are looking at a section of road with barricades indicating either road construction or a road closure. Roads that typically run horizontally across an image suggest a straightforward path rather than an intersection, which would generally be indicated by multiple roadways converging or crossing.
