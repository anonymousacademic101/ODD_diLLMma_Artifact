YES

The road appears to be an intersection since there are road markings that typically indicate crossing paths, such as a stop line and crosswalk lines, implying perpendicular directions of travel. The presence of multiple lanes converging, traffic signals, and signage commonly associated with intersections supports this observation. The road does not simply run horizontally across the image, but intersects with another road.
