NO.

The image provided does not show a road at all. It appears to be an indoor scene with various items such as what looks like computer equipment, a monitor, possibly some cables, and other miscellaneous items on a surface. There's also a cabinet or shelving with documents, and part of a chair is visible as well. The quality of the image is low, and it's somewhat blurry, but it is clearly an interior space and not a road.
