The road runs vertically from the bottom to the top of the image rather than horizontally across it. The road appears to continue straight into the distance, as indicated by the lane markings and the perspective of the road diminishing toward a vanishing point. There are also lights and signs positioned alongside the road, which is characteristic of a road that continues straight rather than one at an intersection.
