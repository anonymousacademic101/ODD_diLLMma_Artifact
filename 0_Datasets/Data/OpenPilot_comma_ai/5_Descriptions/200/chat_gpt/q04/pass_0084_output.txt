The image does not provide a clear view of the road layout, and without context or a wider view of the area, it is impossible to accurately determine if the road runs horizontally across the image or if it is an intersection. We can only see a close-up of the back of a vehicle with its brake lights on, which is not sufficient to make a determination about the road configuration.
