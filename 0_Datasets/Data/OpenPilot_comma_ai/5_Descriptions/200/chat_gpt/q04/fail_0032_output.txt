YES

The road we are driving on runs horizontally across the image. This can be determined because the lanes and the crosswalk lines are oriented in a way that suggests they are perpendicular to the point of view, indicative of a horizontal path relative to the image's perspective. Additionally, the vehicles are parked in a manner that aligns with a horizontal road configuration.
