NO

The road we are driving on does not run horizontally across the image. Instead, it extends vertically from the bottom of the image towards the top, indicating we are viewing the road in the direction of traffic flow. There is no indication that this segment of the road is an intersection; it appears to be a multi-lane road or highway with traffic moving in the same direction, divided by lane markings.
