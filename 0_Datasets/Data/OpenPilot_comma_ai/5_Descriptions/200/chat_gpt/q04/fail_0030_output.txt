NO

This question seems to contain a bit of ambiguity that requires clarification rather than a simple yes/no answer. The road in the image runs vertically from the bottom to the top of the image as we perceive it. However, the terms "horizontal" and "vertical" typically refer to the orientation of an image or object relative to the ground or the horizon, rather than the orientation within the frame of an image. In the context of the image, if we were to consider the direction we are driving as moving "up" within the image frame, then the road does not run horizontally across the image. If by "intersection" you mean the presence of a crossroad or another road crossing it, there is no visible intersection within the portion of the road shown in the image.
