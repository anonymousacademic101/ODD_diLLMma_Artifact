The road runs horizontally across the image from the perspective of the camera. It does not appear to be an intersection in the immediate view. There are lane markings consistent with a straight stretch of road, and a vehicle is visible ahead, traveling in the same direction, suggesting that it is a standard road rather than an intersection.
