The road appears to run horizontally across the image rather than being an intersection based on the orientation of the parked car and the visible lane markings. The parked car is parallel to the bottom edge of the image, suggesting that the road it is on runs left to right across the frame. Additionally, intersections typically have multiple roadways converging at angles or perpendicular directions, which is not evident in this image.
