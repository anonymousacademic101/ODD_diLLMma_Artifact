Unfortunately, I cannot provide detailed information about the direction of the road because the provided image is not clear enough. It shows an extremely zoomed-in, blurry, and indistinct portion of a scene, which might depict a road surface but lacks context to definitively determine its orientation or whether it's an intersection.
