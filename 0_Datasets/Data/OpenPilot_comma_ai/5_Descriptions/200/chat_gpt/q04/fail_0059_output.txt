YES

The image depicts vehicles positioned in such a manner that suggests they are either stopping at an intersection or preparing to move through it. The road markings (which are not clearly visible but can be inferred by the positioning of the vehicles) and the general layout of the area indicate the presence of an intersection rather than a stretch of road running horizontally across the image.
