The road does not appear to be an intersection; it seems to run horizontally across the image as indicated by the positioning of the vehicles which are aligned in a straight manner, consistent with traveling on a straight section of road. Furthermore, there are no visible traffic signals, signs, or markings that would typically indicate an intersection.
