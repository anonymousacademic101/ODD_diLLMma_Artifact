The image quality is quite low, making it difficult to ascertain the precise layout of the road with certainty. However, based on the visible lane markings and the angle of view, it appears that the road does not run horizontally across the image but seems to be a part of an intersection where the lanes and markings suggest turning options, indicative of an intersection rather than a straight road segment. The orientation of the road cannot be definitively determined as horizontal relative to the image frame without a clearer context or a more comprehensive view.
