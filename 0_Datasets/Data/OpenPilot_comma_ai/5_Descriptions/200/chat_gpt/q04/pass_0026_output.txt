The road does not run horizontally across the image; it extends into the depth of the image, showing a perspective where the lanes converge towards a vanishing point in the distance. This suggests that we are looking down a stretch of road rather than a cross-section of an intersection. Additionally, the positioning of the vehicles indicates they are moving along the length of the road, supporting this perspective.
