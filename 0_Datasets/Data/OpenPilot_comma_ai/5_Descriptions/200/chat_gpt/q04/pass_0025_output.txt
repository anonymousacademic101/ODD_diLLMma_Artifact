NO

The road runs horizontally across the image. It is not an intersection as it appears to be a continuous stretch of road with multiple lanes, and traffic is moving parallel to the viewpoint, not intersecting it. The lanes are marked for traffic going in the same direction, and there are no visible traffic signals, signs, or road markings that indicate the presence of an intersection.
