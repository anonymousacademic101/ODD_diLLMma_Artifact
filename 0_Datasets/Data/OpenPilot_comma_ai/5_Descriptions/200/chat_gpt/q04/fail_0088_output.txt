YES

The road appears to run horizontally across the image. You can tell this because of the pedestrian crossing lines, which typically are placed perpendicular to the direction of traffic flow, suggesting that the traffic flows horizontally relative to the image frame. Additionally, the orientation of the "Yield" sign is consistent with this observation, as it is facing traffic that would be crossing the depicted road.
