The road appears to be an intersection based on the visible traffic cones and roadwork barriers suggesting lane merges or detours, which are more common in an intersection or construction zone. The image is blurry and the perspective is limited, so it's difficult to definitively determine the road's layout, but the available clues imply an intersection rather than a road running horizontally across the image.
