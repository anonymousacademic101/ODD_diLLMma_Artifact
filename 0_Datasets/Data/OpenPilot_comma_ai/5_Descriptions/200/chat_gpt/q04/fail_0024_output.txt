The image is not clear enough to definitively determine the layout of the road. It appears to be taken at night with poor lighting, which makes it particularly difficult to assess the direction or configuration of the road confidently. Without more visual information or context, it is not possible to ascertain if you are at an intersection or if the road runs horizontally across the image.
