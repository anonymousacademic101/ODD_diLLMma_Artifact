NO.

The image provided is quite dark and does not offer a clear view of the road layout. However, based on the visible elements, such as the orientation of the vehicle's hood and the position of the other car's taillights, it appears that the road runs horizontally across the image rather than showing an intersection. There is no clear indication of an intersecting road.
