NO.

The image provided is dark and has low resolution, making it very difficult to discern specific road markings or signs that would indicate restricted lanes such as those for buses or bicycles. There are no clear markings or lanes visible in the image that can confirm the presence of restricted lanes; therefore, I cannot confirm that there are any restricted lanes based on the image provided.
