The image provided does not show any indications of the road's surface, markings, or signage that would suggest the presence of restricted lanes such as bus lanes or bicycle lanes. It appears to be an underpass or a tunnel, and without a view of the road itself, it's impossible to determine if there are any restricted lanes.
