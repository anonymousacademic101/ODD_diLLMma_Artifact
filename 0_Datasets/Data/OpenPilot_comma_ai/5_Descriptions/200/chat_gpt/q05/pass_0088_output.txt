NO.

Based on the image provided, I can't see any indications or markings that suggest the presence of restricted lanes specifically for buses or bicycles. The image shows what appears to be a typical highway or multi-lane road at night without any visible signs or road markings that indicate lane restrictions. However, without more context or a clearer view of road signs and markings, it is not possible to say with absolute certainty.
