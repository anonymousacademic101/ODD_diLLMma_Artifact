There are no visible signs or road markings indicating the presence of restricted lanes such as bus or bicycle lanes. The information provided in the image is limited due to low visibility and the angle of the shot, making it challenging to confirm with absolute certainty the absence or presence of restricted lanes beyond the field of view captured.'}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
