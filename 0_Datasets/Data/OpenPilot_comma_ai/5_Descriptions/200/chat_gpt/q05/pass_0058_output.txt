NO.

The image provided is nighttime and the quality is quite low, making it difficult to see details clearly. However, from what I can observe in the picture, there are no visible signs or road markings that indicate the presence of restricted lanes such as bus lanes or bicycle lanes. The road appears to be a regular driving lane without any specific designations for different types of traffic.
