YES

The image shows a section of a road with a red lane that appears to be a bus lane. This is often indicated by the red coloring of the lane and sometimes by associated signage, which is common for designated bus lanes across various cities. The existence of the sign reading "METRO TRANS Bus Transport" also supports the presence of a bus lane, suggesting that this part of the road is intended for bus use or public transportation. Additionally, there is a person with a placard which might indicate that this photo is taken near a bus stop or a place frequented by buses. However, concerning bicycle lanes, the image does not provide clear indications of a designated bicycle lane.
