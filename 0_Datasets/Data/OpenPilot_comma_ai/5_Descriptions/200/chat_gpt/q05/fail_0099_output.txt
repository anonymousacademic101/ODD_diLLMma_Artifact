NO

The image provided is not of sufficient quality or scope to accurately determine the presence of any restricted lanes such as bus lanes or bike lanes. It only shows a partial view of a vehicle and a curb, without any road markings or signage being visible that could indicate the presence of a restricted lane. Therefore, based on the information available in the image, I cannot confirm that there are any restricted lanes on the road.
