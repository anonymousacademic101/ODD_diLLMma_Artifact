YES

The image is blurred, and I'm unable to provide a clear analysis of the road conditions or signage. Therefore, I cannot confirm the presence of any restricted lanes with certainty. However, given common road layouts and traffic management scenarios, it is possible that lanes could be dedicated to specific types of vehicles such as buses or bicycles. If clarification is needed, please provide a sharper image for accurate information.
