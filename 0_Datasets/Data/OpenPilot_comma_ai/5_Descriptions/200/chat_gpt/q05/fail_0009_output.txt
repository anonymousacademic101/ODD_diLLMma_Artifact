The image provided is too low in quality and shows a very limited view of the road, primarily focusing on a small section with visible vehicles, but not enough context to determine the presence of any specific lane restrictions such as bus lanes or bicycle lanes. There are no visible signs, road markings, or other indications of restricted lanes in the segment of the road that we can see.
