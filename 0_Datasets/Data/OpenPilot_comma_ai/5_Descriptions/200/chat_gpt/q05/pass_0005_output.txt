The image provided only shows the rear of a vehicle and does not provide enough contextual information about the road markings, signs, or the presence of any designated lanes for buses, bicycles, or other restricted uses. Therefore, it is not possible to confirm if there are any restricted lanes on the road based on this image alone.
