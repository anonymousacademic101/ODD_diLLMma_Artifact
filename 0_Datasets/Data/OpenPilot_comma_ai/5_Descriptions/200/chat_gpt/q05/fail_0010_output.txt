The quality and angle of the image provided do not allow for a clear and definitive identification of restricted lanes. However, to gauge the presence of restricted lanes such as those for buses or bicycles, one would typically look for specific lane markings, signs, or colored lanes. Since these features are not discernible in the image provided, it's not possible to confirm the presence of restricted lanes. If you need accurate information, please provide a clearer image or more context.
