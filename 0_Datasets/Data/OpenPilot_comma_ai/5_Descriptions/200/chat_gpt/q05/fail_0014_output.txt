NO.

The image provided does not show clear indications of the road lanes or any signage that would suggest the presence of restricted lanes such as bus lanes or bicycle lanes. The photo seems to be taken from inside a vehicle focusing on a side view that captures a pedestrian and a building reflection on another car's windows; therefore, it doesn't offer enough visual information regarding road lane restrictions.
