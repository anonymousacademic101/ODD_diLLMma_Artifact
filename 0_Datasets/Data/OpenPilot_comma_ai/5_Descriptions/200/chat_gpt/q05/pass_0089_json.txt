The lanes appear to be general-purpose vehicle lanes based on the lane markers and the traffic observed in the photo. There are no visible signs or road markings like diamond symbols or specific color-coded lanes that usually indicate such restrictions. However, it's important to mention that visibility is limited and observation may not cover all the possible signs that might be present beyond the field of view or in the distance."}, 'finish_details': {'type': 'stop', 'stop': '<|fim_suffix|>'}, 'index': 0}]}
