NO.

The image shown appears to be a road with typical vehicular traffic, but the quality of the image is not sufficient to identify any specific lane markings or signs that would indicate the presence of restricted lanes such as bus lanes or bicycle lanes. Additionally, the visible portion of the road does not provide any clear indications or distinguishing features of such lanes. Without clear markings or signs, we cannot assume the existence of restricted lanes.
