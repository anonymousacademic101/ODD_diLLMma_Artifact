The image provided is too blurry and lacks clear visibility to determine the specifics of the road we are driving on, including any lane restrictions. To identify restricted lanes, one would need to see clear road markings, signs, or other indicators that specify restrictions such as lanes dedicated to buses, bicycles, or other vehicles. In this case, the quality of the image does not allow for such details to be discerned.
