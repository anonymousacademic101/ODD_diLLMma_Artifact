The image is low resolution and taken at a time of day where the visibility is reduced, likely dusk or dawn, which makes it difficult to discern specific lane markings or signs that would indicate the presence of restricted lanes such as bus or bicycle lanes. The lanes visible in the image appear to be regular traffic lanes, with no visible signs or markings indicating restrictions for their use by certain types of vehicles.
