The image provided shows a road with multiple lanes and vehicles, but there are no visible indications or markings that designate any lanes as restricted specifically for buses, bicycles, or other types of vehicles. The absence of such markings or signage in the portion of the road visible in the image suggests that there are no restricted lanes present. It is important to note, however, that the quality and field of view of the image may not reveal all road markings or signs; thus, a definitive analysis cannot be provided without a clearer or more comprehensive view of the road.
