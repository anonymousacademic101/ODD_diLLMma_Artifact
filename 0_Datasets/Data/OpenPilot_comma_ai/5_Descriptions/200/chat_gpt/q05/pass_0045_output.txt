NO

Based on the image provided, it is not possible to determine with certainty if there are any restricted lanes for buses or bicycles because the image is taken at night and does not clearly show the entirety of the road markings or signs that would indicate such restrictions. The visible road markings suggest a typical vehicular lane without any obvious indications of lane restrictions. However, without broader context or clearer signs, it cannot be confirmed.
