NO

The image shows a road with multiple lanes, and from this angle and the information visible, there are no signs or road markings that explicitly designate any of the lanes as restricted for specific types of traffic such as buses or bicycles. However, without seeing the entire length of the road or additional signage, we cannot be completely certain that there are no restricted lanes further along the road or on other parts.
