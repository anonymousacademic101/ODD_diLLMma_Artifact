NO

The image provided is too blurry and lacks clear visibility of road markings or signs that might indicate the presence of restricted lanes such as bus lanes or bicycle lanes. Due to the low resolution and poor lighting, it's not possible to make out specific details that would confirm the presence of such lanes. Therefore, based on this image alone, it cannot be determined whether there are any restricted lanes.
