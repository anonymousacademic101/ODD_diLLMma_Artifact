YES.

In the image provided, there appears to be a lane that is demarcated with a different surface texture and color along the curb, which is often indicative of a bus lane or a special use lane. The presence of the white pole close to the curb could also suggest some form of lane control or delineation. However, without clearer markings or signs, which are not visible in the current frame of the image, the specific restrictions cannot be determined with certainty.
