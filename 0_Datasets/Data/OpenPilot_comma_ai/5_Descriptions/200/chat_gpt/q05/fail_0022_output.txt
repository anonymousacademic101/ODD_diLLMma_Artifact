NO

The provided image does not offer enough context or visible signs to determine whether there are any restricted lanes such as those for buses or bicycles. The image is zoomed in on a small section of a road or walkway, showing only a curb and the edge of the road with no lane markings or signage in view. Therefore, I cannot confirm the existence of restricted lanes based on this image.
