The image provided is very blurry and taken at nighttime, making it hard to discern specific road markings, signs, or lane designations. From this image alone, there is no clear evidence of a designated bus lane, bicycle lane, or any other type of restricted lane present on the road. The visible section of the road does not have any distinguishing features that would indicate a restriction for certain types of vehicles.
