NO

Based on the visible lane markings and the absence of any specific signage or road surface markings that indicate restrictions for buses or bicycles, it appears that there are no restricted lanes on the stretch of the road visible in the image. The lanes seem to be standard vehicular lanes for mixed traffic use.
