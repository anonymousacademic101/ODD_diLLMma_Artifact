The image shows a street scene with a road divider in the middle of the road. The road divider is made of concrete and has orange cones placed on top of it. On the left side of the road, there is a line of parked cars, and on the right side, there is a row of trees. The road appears to be wet, as there are puddles of water on the ground. There are no pedestrians or other vehicles visible in the image. The time of day appears to be dusk, as the sky is dark, but there is still some light coming from the sky. The image was likely taken in a city, as there are buildings visible in the background.
