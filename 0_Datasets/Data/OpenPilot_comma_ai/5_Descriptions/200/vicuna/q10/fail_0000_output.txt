The image shows a dark, narrow alleyway lined with tall buildings on both sides. The alleyway appears to be dimly lit, with only a few streetlights visible in the distance. The pavement is made of cobblestones, and there are no visible road markings or signs. There are no pedestrians or vehicles visible in the image. The time of day appears to be night, as the sky is dark and there are no visible sunlight sources. The image appears to have been taken from a high angle, looking down the alleyway.
