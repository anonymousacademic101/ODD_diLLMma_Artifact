The image shows a dark, narrow alleyway at night. The alleyway is lined with tall buildings on both sides and there are no street lights or other sources of illumination visible. The alleyway appears to be deserted, with no cars or pedestrians visible. The time of day is night, as there is no sunlight visible and the sky is dark. The image was likely taken with a long exposure, as the buildings in the background are blurred due to the movement of the camera during the exposure.
