The image shows a tunnel with a road running through it. The road has two lanes, one for traffic going in each direction. The walls of the tunnel are made of concrete and are fairly smooth. There are no visible road signs or markings in the image. The lighting in the tunnel is dim, with only a few light fixtures visible on the ceiling. There are no vehicles or pedestrians visible in the image. It appears to be night time, as there are no visible sources of light other than the light fixtures in the tunnel.
