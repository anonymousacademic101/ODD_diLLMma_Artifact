This image shows a road construction site on a city street. There is a large orange barrier blocking off the road, and a sign that reads "Road Closed Ahead." Behind the barrier, there are several vehicles parked on the side of the road, including a black truck and a white van. There are also several people standing around the construction site, some of whom are wearing hard hats and reflective vests. In the background, there are several tall buildings and a cloudy sky. It appears to be a daytime scene, as there are no lights on in the buildings and the sun is shining.
