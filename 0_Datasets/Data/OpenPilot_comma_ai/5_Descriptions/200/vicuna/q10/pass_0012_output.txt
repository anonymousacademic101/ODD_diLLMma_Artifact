The road has a divider in the middle, and there are road signs indicating the speed limit, lane closures, and upcoming intersections. The vehicles are a mix of cars, trucks, and buses, with some driving in the left lane and others in the right lane. There are also some pedestrians on the sidewalks, but they are not shown in the image. The time of day appears to be during the day, as there are no streetlights visible. The weather appears to be clear, as there are no clouds visible in the sky.
