This is a video of a car driving down a city street at night. The street is lined with tall buildings on both sides, and there are streetlights illuminating the area. The car is driving on the right side of the road, and there are other cars and trucks driving in the opposite direction. There are also pedestrians walking on the sidewalk, and some of them are carrying umbrellas to protect themselves from the rain. The time of day is night, and the lighting is provided by streetlights and the headlights of the car.
