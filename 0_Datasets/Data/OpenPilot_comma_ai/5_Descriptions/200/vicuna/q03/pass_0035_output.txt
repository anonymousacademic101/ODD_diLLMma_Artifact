Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The on-off ramp is a section of a highway or road that allows vehicles to enter or exit the highway or road. On-off ramps are typically used at interchanges, where multiple highways or roads intersect. They are designed to allow vehicles to smoothly enter or exit the highway or road, reducing the risk of accidents and congestion.

On-off ramps typically have two lanes: one for vehicles entering the highway or road, and one for vehicles exiting. They also often have traffic signals or signs to help regulate traffic flow and ensure the safety of drivers and pedestrians.

Overall, on-off ramps play an important role in the safe and efficient movement of traffic on highways and roads.
