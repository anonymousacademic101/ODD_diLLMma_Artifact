Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a road at night with streetlights and trees on either side of the road. The road appears to be an on-off ramp as there is a barrier in the middle of the road, and there is a curb on either side of the road. Additionally, there is a sidewalk on the left side of the road and a grassy area on the right side of the road.
