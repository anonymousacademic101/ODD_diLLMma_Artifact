Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The on-off ramp is a type of interchange that allows traffic to enter or exit a highway or other major road. It is typically used to connect a highway or other major road to a smaller road or local street. On-off ramps are designed to allow traffic to flow smoothly and safely between the different roads.

On-off ramps typically have two lanes: one for traffic entering the highway or other major road, and one for traffic exiting. They may also have additional lanes for turning or merging with other traffic. On-off ramps are often located at intersections with other roads, but they can also be found at other locations where traffic needs to change from one road to another.

On-off ramps are an important part of many transportation systems, as they allow traffic to move efficiently between different roads and highways. They help to reduce congestion and improve safety by allowing traffic to flow smoothly and without interruption.
