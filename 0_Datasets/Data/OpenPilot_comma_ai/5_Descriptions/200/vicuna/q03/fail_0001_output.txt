👍YES, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The road in the image appears to be an on-off ramp as it has a solid white line on the left side and a dashed line on the right side, indicating that vehicles can enter or exit the road but not drive straight through it. Additionally, there are several parked cars on the right side of the road, suggesting that it is a residential street.
