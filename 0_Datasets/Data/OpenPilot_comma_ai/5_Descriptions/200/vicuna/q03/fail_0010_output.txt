Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a car driving on a road that appears to be an on-off ramp. The road has a yellow line down the middle, and there is a curb on either side of the road. The car is driving in the left lane, and there are other cars parked on the right side of the road. There is a building in the background on the right side of the road, and there are trees and other buildings visible in the distance.

Based on the image, it is clear that the road is an on-off ramp. The yellow line down the middle of the road and the curb on either side indicate that it is a controlled access road, and the presence of other cars parked on the right side of the road suggests that it is an on-ramp. Additionally, the fact that the car is driving in the left lane further confirms that it is an on-ramp.
