Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The on-off ramp is a type of road that allows vehicles to enter or exit a controlled-access highway, such as a freeway or motorway. On-off ramps are typically located at interchanges, where two or more highways meet. They are designed to allow vehicles to smoothly transition from one highway to another, or from the highway to an adjacent road or parking lot.

On-off ramps typically have two lanes: one for vehicles entering the highway, and one for vehicles exiting the highway. They may also have a shoulder or emergency lane for vehicles that need to pull over or make an emergency stop.

On-off ramps are important for maintaining the flow of traffic on controlled-access highways, as they allow vehicles to enter and exit the highway without disrupting the flow of traffic on the main lanes. They also help to reduce congestion and improve safety by allowing vehicles to merge smoothly onto and off of the highway.
