Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The on-off ramp is a type of road that allows vehicles to enter or exit a controlled-access highway, such as a freeway or motorway. On-off ramps are typically located at interchanges, where two or more highways meet. They are designed to provide a safe and efficient way for vehicles to enter or exit the highway while minimizing the impact on traffic flow.

On-off ramps typically have two lanes: one for vehicles entering the highway, and one for vehicles exiting the highway. They may also have acceleration and deceleration lanes to help vehicles adjust their speed before entering or exiting the highway.

Overall, on-off ramps are an important feature of controlled-access highways, as they help to maintain the flow of traffic and ensure the safety of drivers and passengers.
