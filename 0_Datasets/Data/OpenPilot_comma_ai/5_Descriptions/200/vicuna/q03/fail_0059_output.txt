Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The on-off ramp is a road that allows vehicles to enter or exit a controlled-access highway, such as a freeway or motorway. On-off ramps are typically located at interchanges, where two or more highways meet. They are designed to allow traffic to flow smoothly and safely between the highways and to reduce congestion on the highways.

On-off ramps typically have two lanes, one for traffic entering the highway and one for traffic exiting the highway. They may also have acceleration and deceleration lanes to help vehicles adjust their speed before entering or exiting the highway.

On-off ramps are important for the safe and efficient movement of traffic on controlled-access highways. They help to reduce congestion and delays, and improve the flow of traffic on the highways.
