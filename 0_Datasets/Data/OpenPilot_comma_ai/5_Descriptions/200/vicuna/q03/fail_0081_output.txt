Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a dark night scene with a road running through it. The road appears to be an on-off ramp, as it has a solid white line on the left side and a dashed white line on the right side, indicating that it is an entrance or exit to a highway or other major road. The road also has streetlights on either side, which suggests that it is a well-lit and well-maintained on-off ramp.
