Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The on-off ramp is a type of road that allows vehicles to enter or exit a controlled-access highway, such as a toll road or a controlled-access highway. On-off ramps are typically located at interchanges, which are places where two or more highways intersect. The on-off ramp is designed to allow vehicles to enter or exit the controlled-access highway safely and efficiently, without disrupting the flow of traffic on the highway.

On-off ramps are an important feature of controlled-access highways, as they allow vehicles to enter or exit the highway without having to travel through the main lanes of the highway. This can help to reduce congestion on the highway and improve the flow of traffic. On-off ramps are also important for safety, as they allow vehicles to enter or exit the highway without having to merge with traffic on the highway.

Overall, on-off ramps are an important feature of controlled-access highways, as they allow vehicles to enter or exit the highway safely and efficiently.
