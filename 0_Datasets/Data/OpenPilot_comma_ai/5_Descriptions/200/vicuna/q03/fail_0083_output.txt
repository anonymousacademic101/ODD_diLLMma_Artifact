Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The on-off ramp is a type of interchange that allows traffic to enter or exit a controlled-access highway, such as a freeway or motorway. On-off ramps are typically used to connect local roads to controlled-access highways, allowing drivers to enter or exit the highway at specific locations.

On-off ramps are designed to provide a smooth and safe transition between the local road and the controlled-access highway. They typically have a gradual incline or decline, and may have traffic signals or signs to help regulate traffic flow.

Overall, on-off ramps are an important feature of controlled-access highways, allowing drivers to easily enter or exit the highway and travel to their desired destination.
