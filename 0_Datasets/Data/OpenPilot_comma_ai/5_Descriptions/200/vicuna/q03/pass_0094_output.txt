Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The on-off ramp is a type of road that allows vehicles to enter or exit a highway or other major roadway. On-off ramps are typically found at interchanges, where one road intersects with another. They are designed to allow vehicles to smoothly enter or exit the highway without disrupting the flow of traffic on the main road.

On-off ramps typically have a steep incline or decline to help vehicles gain or lose speed as they enter or exit the highway. They also often have traffic signals or signs to help regulate the flow of traffic and ensure that vehicles are able to safely enter or exit the highway.

Overall, on-off ramps are an important feature of modern road systems, as they help to facilitate the smooth flow of traffic and ensure the safety of drivers and other road users.
