Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a person walking down the street at night. The person is walking on the sidewalk next to the road, which appears to be an on-off ramp. The road has a yellow line down the middle, indicating that it is a divided road. There are no cars visible in the image, so it is unclear whether the person is walking on the on-ramp or off-ramp. However, it is likely that the person is walking on the on-ramp, as there is no visible barrier or divider between the road and the sidewalk.
