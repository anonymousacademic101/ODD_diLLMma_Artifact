Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The on-off ramp is a type of road that allows vehicles to enter or exit a controlled-access highway, such as a freeway or expressway. On-off ramps are typically located at interchanges, where two or more highways meet. They are designed to allow traffic to flow smoothly and safely between the different highways.

On-off ramps typically have two lanes: one for traffic entering the highway, and one for traffic exiting the highway. They may also have acceleration and deceleration lanes, which allow drivers to gain or lose speed before entering or exiting the highway.

On-off ramps are important for maintaining the flow of traffic on controlled-access highways, as they allow drivers to easily enter and exit the highway without disrupting the flow of traffic. They also help to reduce congestion and improve safety on the roads.
