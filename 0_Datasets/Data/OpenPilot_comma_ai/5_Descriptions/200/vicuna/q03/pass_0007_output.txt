Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

An on-off ramp is a type of ramp that allows vehicles to enter or exit a highway or other major roadway. On-off ramps are typically used at interchanges, where multiple roads come together or split apart. They are designed to provide a smooth and safe transition for vehicles moving between the different roadways.

On-off ramps are typically longer and wider than other types of ramps, and they often have a gradual slope to help vehicles gain speed as they move onto or off of the highway. They may also have guardrails or other safety features to help prevent vehicles from leaving the ramp or entering it at the wrong time.

Overall, on-off ramps are an important part of many road systems, helping to facilitate the flow of traffic and ensure the safety of drivers and their passengers.
