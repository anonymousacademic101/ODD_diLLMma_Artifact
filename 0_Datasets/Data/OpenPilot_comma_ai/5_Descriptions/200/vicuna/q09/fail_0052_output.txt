Yes, the road we are driving on is hilly.

The image shows a person walking down a street at night. The street appears to be hilly, as there are several changes in elevation visible in the image. The buildings on either side of the street are tall and appear to be made of concrete or brick. There is a sidewalk on the left side of the street, and a road on the right side. The person in the image is walking down the sidewalk, and there is a car parked on the right side of the road. The image is blurry, but it appears to be a clear night with stars visible in the sky.
