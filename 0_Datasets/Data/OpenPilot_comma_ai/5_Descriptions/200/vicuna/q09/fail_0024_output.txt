Yes, the road we are driving on is hilly.

The image shows a car driving on a hilly road at night. The road appears to be winding and narrow, with trees on either side. The car's headlights are illuminating the road ahead, and its taillights are visible in the rearview mirror. The license plate on the car is not visible in the image.
