YES, there are extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight into the camera.

The image shows a dark and empty room with a wooden floor. There are no objects or people in the room. The only light in the room comes from the oncoming headlights of a car outside the room. The headlights shine through the window and illuminate the room with a bright, white light. The light is so bright that it casts shadows on the walls and floor of the room.

The headlights also create a glare on the camera lens, making it difficult to see anything else in the room. The bright light from the headlights is the only source of light in the room, so it is the only thing that can be seen.

Overall, the image shows a dark and empty room with bright headlights shining through the window. The headlights create a glare on the camera lens and make it difficult to see anything else in the room.
