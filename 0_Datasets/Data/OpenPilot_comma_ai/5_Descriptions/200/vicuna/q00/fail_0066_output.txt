The image shows a car driving on a street with heavy rain falling from the sky. The visibility is low due to the rain, making it difficult for the driver to see the road ahead. The car's windshield wipers are working hard to clear the rain from the windshield, but it is still difficult to see through the rain. The road is also wet, making it slippery and dangerous for the car to drive on. It is advisable for the driver to slow down and be cautious while driving in such adverse weather conditions.
