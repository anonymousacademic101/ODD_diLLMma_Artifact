Yes, the road we are driving on is an intersection.

The image shows a silver car driving on a road that appears to be an intersection. The car is parked on the right side of the road, and there is a guardrail on the left side of the road. The road appears to be a two-way road, as there are cars driving in both directions. The image also shows a bridge in the background, which suggests that the road is crossing over a body of water.
