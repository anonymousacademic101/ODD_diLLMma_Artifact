NO, the road we are driving on is an intersection.

The image shows a car driving on a road that appears to be an intersection. The road has a stop sign on the left side and a yield sign on the right side, indicating that the driver must stop and yield the right of way to any pedestrians or other vehicles in the intersection. There are no other vehicles or pedestrians visible in the image, so it appears that the driver is proceeding through the intersection without having to stop or yield.
