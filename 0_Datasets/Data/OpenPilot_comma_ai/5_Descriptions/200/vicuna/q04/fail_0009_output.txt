Yes, the road in the image runs horizontally across the image.

The image shows a parking lot with several cars parked in it. The cars are parked in such a way that they are not blocking any other cars from entering or leaving the parking lot. The cars are parked in a straight line, with each car parked next to the car in front of it. The cars are parked close enough to each other that they almost touch, but there is enough space between them for people to get in and out of the cars. The cars are parked on the right side of the image, and there is a building on the left side of the image. The building has several windows that are visible in the image, and there is a sign on the building that is not visible in the image. The image is taken at night, and there are no lights on in the parking lot or on the building. The only light in the image comes from the headlights of the cars, which are shining on the pavement.
