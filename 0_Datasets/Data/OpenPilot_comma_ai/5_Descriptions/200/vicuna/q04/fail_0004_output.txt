Yes, the road we are driving on is an intersection.

The image shows a road running horizontally across the image, with a stop sign on the left side of the road and a pedestrian crossing on the right side of the road. The road appears to intersect with another road that is perpendicular to it, and there are buildings and trees on either side of the road.
