Yes, the road we are driving on is an intersection.

The image shows a city street at night with streetlights and buildings on either side of the road. There is a car driving down the road and a person walking on the sidewalk. The road appears to be a T-intersection, with the car driving straight ahead and the person walking perpendicular to the road.
