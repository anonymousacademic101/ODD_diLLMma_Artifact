Yes, the road we are driving on is hilly.

The image shows a black truck driving on a hilly road at night. The truck is driving on the left side of the road and there is a guardrail on the right side of the road. The road appears to be winding and going up and down. There are no other vehicles visible in the image. The image was taken at night, as the sky is dark and there are no streetlights visible.
