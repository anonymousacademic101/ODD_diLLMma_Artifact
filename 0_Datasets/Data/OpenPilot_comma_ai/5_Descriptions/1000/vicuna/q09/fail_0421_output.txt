Yes, the road we are driving on is hilly.

The image shows a car driving on a hilly road at night. The car's headlights are shining brightly, illuminating the road ahead. The road appears to be winding and steep, with several turns and inclines visible. The darkness of the night makes it difficult to see the surroundings, but it is clear that the road is not flat and straight. The car's headlights are the only source of light in the image, casting beams of light that stretch out into the darkness. The road appears to be made of asphalt or concrete, and there are no visible road markings or signs. The image is taken from a low angle, looking up at the car as it drives towards the camera.
