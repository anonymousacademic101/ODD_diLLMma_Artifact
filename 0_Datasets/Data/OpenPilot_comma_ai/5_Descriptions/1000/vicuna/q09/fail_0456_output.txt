Yes, the road we are driving on is hilly.

The image shows a car driving on a hilly road in a parking garage at night. The road appears to be uneven, with some areas that are higher than others. This suggests that the road is hilly. Additionally, the shadows of the cars and the building indicate that the light source is coming from above, which further suggests that the road is hilly.
