Yes, the road we are driving on is hilly.

The image shows a car driving on a hilly road at night. The headlights of the car illuminate the road ahead, revealing the uneven terrain. The road appears to be winding and narrow, with steep inclines and declines. The darkness of the night makes it difficult to see the details of the road, but it is clear that the road is not flat. The car's headlights cast long shadows on the sides of the road, adding to the sense of unevenness.
