Yes, the road we are driving on is hilly.

The image shows a car driving down a hilly road at night. The car's headlights illuminate the road ahead, revealing the uneven terrain. The road appears to be winding and narrow, with trees and buildings on either side. The darkness of the night makes it difficult to see the details of the surroundings, but it is clear that the road is not straight and level. The car's headlights cast long shadows on the ground, adding to the sense of unevenness.
