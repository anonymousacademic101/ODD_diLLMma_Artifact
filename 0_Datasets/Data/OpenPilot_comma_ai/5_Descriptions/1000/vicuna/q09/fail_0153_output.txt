Yes, the road we are driving on is hilly.

The image shows a car driving down a hilly road at night. The road appears to be winding and narrow, with no visible lane markings. The car is a white SUV with tinted windows, and it appears to be driving slowly and cautiously down the road. There are no other vehicles visible in the image, and the only lighting comes from the headlights of the car. The image is blurry and difficult to see, but it appears to be a hilly road.
