Yes, the road we are driving on is hilly.

The image shows a car driving down a hilly road at night, with the headlights of the car illuminating the road ahead. The road appears to be winding and narrow, with no other vehicles visible in the image. The trees on either side of the road are also visible, with their branches swaying in the wind. The sky is dark, with only the light from the car's headlights illuminating the area around it.
