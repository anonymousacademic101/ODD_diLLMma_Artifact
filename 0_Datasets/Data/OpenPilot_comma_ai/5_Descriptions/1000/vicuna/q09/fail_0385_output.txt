Yes, the road we are driving on is hilly.

The image shows a car driving down a hilly road at night. The car is black and has tinted windows. The headlights of the car are on, illuminating the road ahead. The road appears to be winding and narrow, with trees on either side. There is a full moon in the sky, casting light on the scene. The image is taken from a low angle, looking up at the car as it drives down the road. The license plate of the car is not visible in the image.
