Yes, the road we are driving on is hilly.

The image shows a car driving down a hilly road at night. The road appears to be winding and narrow, with trees on either side. The car's headlights illuminate the road ahead, and its taillights can be seen in the distance. The car appears to be moving slowly and cautiously down the road, possibly due to the steepness of the incline.
