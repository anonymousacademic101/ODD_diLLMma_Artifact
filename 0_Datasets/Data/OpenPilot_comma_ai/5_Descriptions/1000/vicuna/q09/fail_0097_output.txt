Yes, the road we are driving on is hilly.

The road we are driving on is hilly because the terrain is uneven and there are many changes in elevation. The road may have been built on a hillside or through a mountainous area, or it may have been constructed with a lot of curves and turns to follow the contours of the land. The road may also have been built on a budget that did not allow for the expense of smoothing out the terrain, leading to a hilly road.
