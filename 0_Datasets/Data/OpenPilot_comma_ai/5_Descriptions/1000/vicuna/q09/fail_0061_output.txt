Yes, the road we are driving on is hilly.

The image shows a car driving down a street with buildings on either side of the road. The road appears to be hilly, with the car moving up and down as it follows the contours of the road. The car is a white SUV with tinted windows, and it appears to be traveling at a moderate speed. There are no other vehicles visible in the image, but there are several pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The buildings on either side of the road appear to be commercial, with storefronts and signs visible. The image was taken during the day, as there is plenty of natural light and the shadows of the buildings are clearly visible.
