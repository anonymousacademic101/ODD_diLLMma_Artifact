Yes, the road we are driving on is hilly.

The image shows a car driving down a hilly road at night. The road appears to be narrow and winding, with no visible lane markings or streetlights. The car's headlights illuminate the road ahead, revealing the steep incline and decline of the road. The car's taillights also appear to be on, indicating that it is moving forward. The darkness of the surrounding area makes it difficult to see any other vehicles or obstacles on the road.
