Yes, the road we are driving on is hilly.

The image shows a car driving on a hilly road at night. The headlights of the car are illuminating the road ahead, and the car's taillights are also visible in the image. The road appears to be winding and narrow, with trees and other vegetation on either side. It is likely that the road is located in a hilly or mountainous area, as the terrain in the background appears to be uneven and rocky.
