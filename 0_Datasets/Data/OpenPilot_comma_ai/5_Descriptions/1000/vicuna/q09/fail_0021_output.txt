Yes, the road we are driving on is hilly.

The road we are driving on is hilly because it is a mountain road. The road is winding and narrow, with steep inclines and declines. The road is surrounded by trees and rocks, and there are no guardrails on the side of the road. The road is not well lit, and there are no streetlights or headlights from oncoming traffic to illuminate the road. The road is slippery, and there is a risk of losing control of the vehicle if we are not careful. The road is also narrow, and there is a risk of collision with oncoming traffic if we are not careful.
