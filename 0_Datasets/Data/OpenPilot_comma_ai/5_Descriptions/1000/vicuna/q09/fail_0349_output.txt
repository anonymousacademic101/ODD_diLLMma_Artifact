Yes, the road we are driving on is hilly.

The image shows a group of cars driving on a hilly road. The road appears to be narrow and winding, with a steep incline on one side and a steep decline on the other. The cars are driving in single file, with the lead car heading down the incline and the rest of the cars following behind. There are no pedestrians or other vehicles visible in the image. The sky is clear and blue, and there are trees and buildings visible in the background.
