Yes, the road we are driving on is hilly.

The image shows a car driving down a hilly road at night. The road appears to be winding and narrow, with trees on either side. The car is a silver sedan, and it appears to be traveling down the road at a moderate speed. The headlights of the car are illuminating the road ahead, and the taillights are visible in the rear. The license plate on the car is not visible in the image.
