Yes, the road we are driving on is hilly.

The image shows a car driving on a hilly road. The car is a white Nissan Sentra, and it is driving on the right side of the road. There are trees on both sides of the road, and there is a guardrail on the left side of the road. The road appears to be winding and hilly, with several turns and inclines visible. There are also other vehicles on the road, including a truck in the distance and a car in front of the Nissan Sentra.
