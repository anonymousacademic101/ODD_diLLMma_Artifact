Yes, the road we are driving on is hilly.

The image shows a car driving on a hilly road at night. The road appears to be winding and narrow, with trees and buildings on either side. The headlights of the car are illuminating the road ahead, and the taillights are visible in the distance. The car appears to be moving slowly and cautiously along the road, possibly due to the steepness of the incline.
