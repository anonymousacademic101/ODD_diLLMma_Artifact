Yes, the road we are driving on is an intersection.

The image shows a car driving on a road at night. The road appears to be an intersection, as there is a stop sign on the right side of the image and a streetlight on the left side of the image. The car is driving towards the left side of the image, which suggests that it is turning left at the intersection. There are no other vehicles or pedestrians visible in the image, so it appears that the car is the only one on the road at this time. The image is taken from a low angle, looking up the road, so we cannot see the end of the road or any buildings or other structures in the background.
