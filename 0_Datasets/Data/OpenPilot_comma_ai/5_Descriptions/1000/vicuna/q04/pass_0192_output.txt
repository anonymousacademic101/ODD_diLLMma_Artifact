YES, the road we are driving on is an intersection.

The image shows a road at night with streetlights on either side of the road. The road appears to be an intersection, as there is a stop sign on the left side of the image and a yield sign on the right side of the image. The road is straight and appears to continue into the distance. There are no other vehicles or people visible in the image.
