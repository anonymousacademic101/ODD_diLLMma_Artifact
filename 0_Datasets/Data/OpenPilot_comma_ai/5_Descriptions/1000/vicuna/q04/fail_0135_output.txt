Yes, the road we are driving on is an intersection.

The image shows a street at night with streetlights and buildings on either side of the road. The road appears to run horizontally across the image, as there are no visible intersections or turns in the road. Additionally, the buildings on either side of the road appear to be straight and parallel to the road, rather than angled or intersecting with it.
