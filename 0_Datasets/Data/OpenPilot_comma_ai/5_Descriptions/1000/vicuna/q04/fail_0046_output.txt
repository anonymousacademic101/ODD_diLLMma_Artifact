Yes, the road in the image runs horizontally across the image.

The image shows a parking lot with several cars parked in it. The cars are parked in rows, with some cars facing in one direction and others facing in the opposite direction. The cars are parked close to each other, with very little space between them. The parking lot is surrounded by a white line, which separates it from the road. There are no other vehicles or people visible in the image. The image is taken at night, as there are no lights on in the parking lot or on the road.
