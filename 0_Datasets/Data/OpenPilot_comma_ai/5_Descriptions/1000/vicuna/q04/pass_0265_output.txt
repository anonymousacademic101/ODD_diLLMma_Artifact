YES, the road in the image is an intersection.

The image shows a dark, empty road at night with streetlights on either side of the road. The road appears to intersect with another road in the distance, indicating that it is an intersection. There are no other vehicles or pedestrians visible in the image, which further supports the idea that it is an intersection.
