Yes, the road in the image runs horizontally across the image.

The image shows a parking lot with several cars parked in it. The cars are parked in front of a building with a sign that says "Motel" on it. The image was taken at night, and the only light in the image comes from the headlights of the cars and the streetlights. The image is in black and white, and the only colors in the image are the red and green brake lights on the cars. The image is well-composed, with the cars parked in a straight line and the building in the background. The image is clear and easy to see, with no distortion or blurriness. The image is a good representation of a parking lot at night.
