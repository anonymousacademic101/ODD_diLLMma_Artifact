YES, the road we are driving on is an intersection.

The image shows a car driving on a road at night. The road appears to be an intersection, as there is a stop sign on the left side of the image and a pedestrian crossing sign on the right side of the image. Additionally, there are streetlights on both sides of the road, which would be present at an intersection.
