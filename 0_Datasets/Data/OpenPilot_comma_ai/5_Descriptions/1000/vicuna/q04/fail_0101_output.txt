Yes, the road we are driving on is an intersection.

The image shows a road that appears to be an intersection, as there is a dividing line in the middle of the road. The road appears to be going down a hill, and there is a guardrail on the left side of the road. There is also a barrier on the right side of the road. The road appears to be a two-lane road, with one lane going down the hill and the other lane going up the hill.
