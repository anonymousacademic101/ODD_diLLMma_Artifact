Yes, the road we are driving on is an intersection.

The image shows a road with a yellow line down the middle, indicating that it is a divided road. On the left side of the image, there is a barrier separating the road from the sidewalk, and on the right side, there is a guardrail separating the road from the edge of the road. This indicates that the road is an intersection, where two or more roads meet and traffic must stop or yield to traffic on the other roads.
