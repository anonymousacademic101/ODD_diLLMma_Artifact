Yes, the road we are driving on is an intersection.

The image shows a road running horizontally across the image, with a barrier in the middle of the road. The barrier is made of concrete and has metal poles on top of it. On the left side of the image, there is a building with a sign that says "ImageContent". On the right side of the image, there is a car parked on the side of the road. The car's license plate is not visible in the image. The road appears to be empty, with no other vehicles or people in sight. The image was taken in the evening, as the sky is dark and there are streetlights on the road.
