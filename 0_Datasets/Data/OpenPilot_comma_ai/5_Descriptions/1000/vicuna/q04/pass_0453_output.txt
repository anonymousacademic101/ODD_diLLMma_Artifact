Yes, the road we are driving on is an intersection.

The image shows a car driving down a road at night with streetlights on either side of the road. The road appears to be an intersection, as there is a stop sign on the left side of the image and a yield sign on the right side. Additionally, there are no other cars visible in the image, which suggests that the road is not a through street.
