Yes, the road we are driving on is an intersection.

In the image, we can see two cars parked on the left side of the road, and one car driving on the right side of the road. The road appears to be an intersection, as there is a stop sign on the left side of the image and a pedestrian crossing sign on the right side of the image. Additionally, there are no visible lane markings on the road, which suggests that it is an intersection rather than a straight road.
