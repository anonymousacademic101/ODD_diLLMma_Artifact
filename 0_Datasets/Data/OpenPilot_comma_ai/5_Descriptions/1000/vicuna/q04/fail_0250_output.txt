YES, the road we are driving on is an intersection.

The image shows a dark, winding road that appears to be going down a hill. There are trees on both sides of the road, and it appears to be a residential area. The road appears to be an intersection, as there is a stop sign on the left side of the image and a yield sign on the right side. The road appears to be straight, running horizontally across the image.
