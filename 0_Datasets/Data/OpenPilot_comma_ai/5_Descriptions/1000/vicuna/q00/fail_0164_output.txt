👍YES, the image has poor visibility due to heavy rain.

Explanation: The image shows a street with parked cars on both sides and a fire hydrant in the middle of the road. The visibility is poor due to heavy rain falling from the sky, which is shown in the image. The water droplets on the camera lens and the blurred view of the cars on the other side of the road indicate that the visibility is not clear.
