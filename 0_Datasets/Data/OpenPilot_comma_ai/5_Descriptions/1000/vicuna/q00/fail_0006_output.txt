👍YES, the image has poor visibility due to adverse weather conditions.

Explanation: The image shows a car parked on the side of the road with a clear view of the surrounding area. However, the visibility is poor due to the heavy rain falling in the background. The rain droplets on the camera lens and the wet road surface create a blurry effect, making it difficult to see the car and the surrounding environment clearly.
