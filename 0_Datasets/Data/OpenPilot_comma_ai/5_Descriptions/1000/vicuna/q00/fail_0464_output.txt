Yes, the image has poor visibility due to the heavy rain.

The image shows a person walking in the rain with an umbrella. The umbrella is blocking the view of the person's face, making it difficult to see their features. Additionally, the rain is falling heavily, creating a blur effect that makes it difficult to see the person's surroundings. The darkness of the night also adds to the poor visibility of the image.
