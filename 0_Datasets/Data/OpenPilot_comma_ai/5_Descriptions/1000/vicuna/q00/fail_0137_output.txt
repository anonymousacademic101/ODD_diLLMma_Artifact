Yes, the image has poor visibility due to the heavy rain.

The image shows a car driving on a wet road with heavy rain falling from the sky. The visibility is low due to the rain, making it difficult for the driver to see the road ahead. The car's headlights are on, but they are not enough to illuminate the road in such adverse weather conditions. The car's windshield wipers are working hard to clear the water from the windshield, but it is still difficult to see through the glass.

In such conditions, it is important to be cautious while driving and to reduce speed to avoid any potential hazards on the road. It is also advisable to turn on the windshield wipers and headlights to improve visibility.
