YES, the image has poor visibility due to the adverse weather conditions.

The image shows a car driving on a city street at night. The streetlights are on, but they are not bright enough to illuminate the entire scene. The car's headlights are on, but they are not bright enough to light up the road ahead. The car's taillights are also on, but they are not bright enough to be seen from a distance.

The visibility is poor due to the adverse weather conditions, such as heavy rain, snow, fog, or other adverse weather conditions. The weather conditions make it difficult for the driver to see what is ahead of them, which can be dangerous. It is important for drivers to be cautious when driving in adverse weather conditions and to use their headlights and taillights to improve their visibility.
