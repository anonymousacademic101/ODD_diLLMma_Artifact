The road we are driving on appears to be a narrow, winding road with steep cliffs on one side and a river running alongside it. The road seems to be made of asphalt and there are no visible lane markings or road signs. The terrain is hilly and there are trees and other vegetation growing along the sides of the road. It appears to be a scenic but challenging drive.
