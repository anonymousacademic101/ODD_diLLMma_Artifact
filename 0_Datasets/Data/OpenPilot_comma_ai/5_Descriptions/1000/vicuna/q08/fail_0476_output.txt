Yes, the road we are driving on is narrow and winding.

The image shows a car driving down a narrow and winding road. The road appears to be made of asphalt and has yellow lines on either side. There are buildings on either side of the road, and trees can be seen in the background. The car in the image appears to be an old, blue Volkswagen Beetle, with its windows down and its doors open. It appears to be driving slowly down the road, and there is a person in the driver's seat.
