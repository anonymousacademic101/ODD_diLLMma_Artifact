Yes, there are extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight into the camera.

The image shows a dark alley with a car parked at the end of it. The car's headlights are shining brightly, illuminating the area in front of the car. There is also a bright light coming from the left side of the image, which appears to be the sun shining through an open garage door. The light is so bright that it is causing a glare on the camera lens, making it difficult to see anything else in the image.
