👍YES, there are extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight into the camera.

The image shows a car driving in the dark with its headlights on. The headlights are shining brightly and illuminating the area in front of the car. The car's taillights are also visible in the image, but they are not as bright as the headlights. It is clear that the car is driving in the dark, and the headlights are providing visibility for the driver.
