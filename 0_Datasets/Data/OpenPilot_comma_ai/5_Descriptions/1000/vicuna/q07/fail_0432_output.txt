Yes, there are extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight into the camera.

The image shows a car driving on a road at night. The headlights of the car are shining brightly on the road, illuminating the area in front of the car. The light from the headlights is so bright that it is visible in the camera's viewfinder, even though the camera is set to a low light sensitivity. This is because the headlights are emitting a large amount of light, which is reflected off the road and into the camera's lens.

In addition to the headlights, there may be other sources of bright light in the camera's viewfinder, such as streetlights or other vehicles on the road. These sources of light can create glare and make it difficult to see the image on the camera's LCD screen.

Overall, the bright lights from oncoming headlights and other sources of light can make it difficult to see the image on the camera's LCD screen, especially in low light conditions.
