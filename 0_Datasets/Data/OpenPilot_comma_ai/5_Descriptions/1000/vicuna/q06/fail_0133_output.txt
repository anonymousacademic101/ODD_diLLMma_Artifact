Yes, the road we are driving on has construction.

The image shows a black truck driving on a road at night. The road appears to have construction going on, as there are cones and barriers in the middle of the road. The truck's headlights are illuminating the road ahead, and it appears to be driving slowly and cautiously through the construction area.
