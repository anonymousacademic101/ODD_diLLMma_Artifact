Yes, there is construction on the road we are driving on.

The image shows a street at night with a car driving down the middle of the road. There are streetlights on either side of the road, and there are buildings on either side of the road as well. It appears that there is construction going on in the area, as there are cones and barriers in the road, and there are construction vehicles parked on the side of the road. It is difficult to determine the exact nature of the construction from the image alone, but it is clear that there is some kind of work being done on the road.
