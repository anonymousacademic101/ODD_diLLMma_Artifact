No, there is no construction on the road we are driving on.

The image shows a person riding a motorcycle on a city street at night. The person is wearing a yellow helmet and black leather jacket, and is holding onto the handlebars of the motorcycle with both hands. The motorcycle appears to be a black and yellow Ducati Scrambler, and it has a yellow fuel tank and black wheels. The street is empty and there are no other vehicles or pedestrians in sight. The buildings on either side of the street appear to be made of brick and have large windows. There is a streetlight on the left side of the image, which is casting a bright light on the person and the motorcycle. The image is clear and well-lit, and it appears to have been taken at night.
