Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The on-off ramp is a type of interchange that allows traffic to enter or exit a controlled-access highway, such as a freeway or motorway. On-off ramps are typically used to connect local roads to controlled-access highways, allowing drivers to enter or exit the highway at specific locations.

On-off ramps typically have two lanes: one for traffic entering the highway, and one for traffic exiting the highway. They are designed to provide a smooth and safe transition between the local road and the controlled-access highway.

On-off ramps are important for traffic flow and safety on controlled-access highways. They help to reduce congestion and delays on the highway by allowing traffic to enter and exit at specific locations, rather than having to travel the entire length of the highway to reach their destination.

Overall, on-off ramps are an essential feature of controlled-access highways, providing a safe and efficient way for drivers to enter and exit the highway.
