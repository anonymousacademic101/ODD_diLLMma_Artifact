YES, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a road at night with streetlights on the side of the road and a car driving on the road. The road appears to be an on-off ramp, as there is a solid white line on the left side of the road and a dashed white line on the right side of the road, indicating that it is an on-ramp. The car is driving in the direction of the on-ramp, which suggests that it is entering the highway.
