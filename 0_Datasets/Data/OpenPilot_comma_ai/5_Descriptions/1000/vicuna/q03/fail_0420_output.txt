üëçYES, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The on-off ramp is a type of interchange that allows vehicles to enter or exit a controlled-access highway, such as a freeway or motorway. On-off ramps are typically used to connect local roads to controlled-access highways, allowing drivers to enter or exit the highway at specific locations.

On-off ramps are designed to provide a safe and efficient way for drivers to enter or exit the highway while minimizing the impact on traffic flow. They typically include traffic signals, lane markings, and signs to guide drivers and help them navigate the ramp safely.

Overall, on-off ramps play an important role in the design of controlled-access highways and help to ensure that drivers can access the highway safely and efficiently.
