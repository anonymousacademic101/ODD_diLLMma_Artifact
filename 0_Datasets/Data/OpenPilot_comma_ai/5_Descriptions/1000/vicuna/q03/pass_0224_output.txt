Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The on-off ramp is a type of interchange that allows traffic to enter or exit a controlled-access highway, such as a freeway or motorway. On-off ramps are typically used to connect local roads to controlled-access highways, allowing drivers to enter or exit the highway at specific locations. They are typically located at intersections with controlled-access highways and are designed to allow traffic to flow smoothly and safely between the local road and the highway.

On-off ramps are an important feature of controlled-access highway systems, as they help to reduce congestion and improve traffic flow by allowing drivers to enter or exit the highway at specific locations rather than having to travel the entire length of the highway to reach their destination. They also help to improve safety by reducing the risk of accidents caused by drivers merging onto or off of the highway at non-designated locations.

Overall, on-off ramps are a key component of controlled-access highway systems and play an important role in facilitating the safe and efficient movement of traffic.
