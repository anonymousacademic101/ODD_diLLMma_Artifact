Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The on-off ramp is a type of road that allows vehicles to enter or exit a controlled-access highway, such as a freeway or motorway. On-off ramps are typically located at interchanges, where two or more highways meet and traffic can change direction. They are designed to allow vehicles to smoothly enter or exit the highway without disrupting the flow of traffic on the main road.

On-off ramps typically have two lanes: one for vehicles entering the highway, and one for vehicles exiting the highway. They may also have a third lane for merging traffic or for vehicles waiting to enter or exit the highway.

On-off ramps are important for maintaining the flow of traffic on controlled-access highways, as they allow vehicles to enter and exit the highway without disrupting the flow of traffic on the main road. They also help to reduce congestion and improve safety on the highways.
