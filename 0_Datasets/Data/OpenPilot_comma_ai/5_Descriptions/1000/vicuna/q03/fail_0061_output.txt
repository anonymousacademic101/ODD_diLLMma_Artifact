Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a car driving on a road that appears to be an on-off ramp. The car is driving on the left side of the road and there is a curb on the right side. The road appears to be a city street with buildings on either side and a sidewalk in front of them. There is a stop sign on the right side of the road, indicating that the car must come to a stop before proceeding. The car appears to be driving slowly and cautiously, possibly due to the presence of pedestrians or other vehicles on the road.
