Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The on-off ramp is a type of road that allows vehicles to enter or exit a controlled-access highway, such as a freeway or motorway. On-off ramps are typically located at interchanges, where multiple highways or roads converge. They are designed to provide a safe and efficient way for vehicles to enter or exit the highway while minimizing the impact on traffic flow.

On-off ramps typically have two lanes: one for vehicles entering the highway, and one for vehicles exiting the highway. They are often marked with white lines or other visual cues to help drivers navigate the ramp safely.

Overall, on-off ramps are an important feature of controlled-access highways, as they allow drivers to easily enter or exit the highway while minimizing disruptions to traffic flow.
