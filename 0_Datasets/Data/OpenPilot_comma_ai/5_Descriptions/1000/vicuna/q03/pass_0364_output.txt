Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The on-off ramp is a type of road that allows vehicles to enter or exit a controlled-access highway, such as a freeway or motorway. On-off ramps are typically located at interchanges, where two or more highways meet and traffic can change direction. They are designed to provide a safe and efficient way for vehicles to enter and exit the highway, while minimizing the impact on traffic flow.

On-off ramps typically have two lanes: one for vehicles entering the highway, and one for vehicles exiting the highway. They may also have additional lanes for turning or merging traffic. The entrance and exit lanes are separated by a barrier, such as a guardrail or concrete median, to prevent vehicles from crossing over and entering the wrong lane.

On-off ramps are important for maintaining the flow of traffic on controlled-access highways, as they allow vehicles to enter and exit the highway safely and efficiently. They also help to reduce congestion and delays on the highway, as well as improve safety for drivers and passengers.
