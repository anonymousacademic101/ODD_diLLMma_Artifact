Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The on-off ramp is a type of road that allows vehicles to enter or exit a controlled-access highway, such as a freeway or motorway. On-off ramps are typically located at interchanges, where multiple highways or roads converge. They are designed to provide a smooth and safe transition for vehicles moving between the highway and the adjacent road, or vice versa.

On-off ramps typically have two lanes: one for vehicles entering the highway, and one for vehicles exiting the highway. They may also have acceleration and deceleration lanes to help vehicles build up or lose speed before entering or exiting the highway.

On-off ramps are important for maintaining the flow of traffic on controlled-access highways, as they allow vehicles to enter and exit the highway without disrupting the flow of traffic on the main lanes. They also help to reduce the risk of accidents by providing a safe and well-designed transition between the highway and the adjacent road.
