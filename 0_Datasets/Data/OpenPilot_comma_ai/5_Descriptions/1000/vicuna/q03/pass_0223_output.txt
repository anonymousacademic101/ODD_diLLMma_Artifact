Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The on-off ramp is a type of road that allows vehicles to enter or exit a controlled-access highway, such as a freeway or expressway. On-off ramps are typically located at interchanges, where two or more highways meet. They are designed to allow traffic to flow smoothly and safely between the highways and the local road network.

On-off ramps typically have two lanes, one for traffic entering the highway and one for traffic exiting the highway. They may also have additional lanes for turning or merging traffic. The ramps are designed to provide a smooth and gradual transition between the highway and the local road network, allowing drivers to safely adjust their speed and direction as they move between the two types of roads.

On-off ramps are an important part of modern transportation systems, as they allow drivers to easily access and exit controlled-access highways and move between different parts of a city or region. They play a key role in reducing congestion and improving traffic flow on the highways.
