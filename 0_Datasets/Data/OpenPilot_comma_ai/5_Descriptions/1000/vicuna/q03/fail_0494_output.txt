Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a car parked on the side of a road with a building in the background. The road appears to be an on-off ramp as there is a curb on one side and a yellow line on the other side, indicating that it is a designated area for vehicles to enter or exit the road. Additionally, there is a sign on the building that reads "Loading Dock" which further supports the idea that this is an on-off ramp.
