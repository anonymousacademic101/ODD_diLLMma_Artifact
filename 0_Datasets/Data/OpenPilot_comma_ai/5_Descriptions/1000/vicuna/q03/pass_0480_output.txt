Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The on-off ramp is a road that allows vehicles to enter or exit a highway. It is typically located at the end of a highway or interstate, and is used to control the flow of traffic onto or off of the highway. The on-off ramp is designed to allow vehicles to enter or exit the highway smoothly and safely, without disrupting the flow of traffic on the highway.

On-off ramps are important for maintaining the safety and efficiency of the highway system. They help to reduce congestion and delays on the highway, and make it easier for drivers to navigate the road network. On-off ramps also help to reduce the risk of accidents, by allowing vehicles to enter and exit the highway in a controlled and orderly manner.

Overall, on-off ramps are an important part of the highway system, and play a vital role in ensuring the safety and efficiency of the road network.
