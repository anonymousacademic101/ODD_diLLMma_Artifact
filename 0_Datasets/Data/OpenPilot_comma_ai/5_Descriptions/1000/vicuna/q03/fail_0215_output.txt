Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a dark street at night with streetlights and trees on either side of the road. There is a stop sign on the left side of the road, indicating that it is an on-off ramp. The road appears to be a continuation of a larger road, as there is a line on the right side of the image that seems to indicate the continuation of the road. The image also shows a police car parked on the right side of the road, which suggests that it is an on-off ramp for a highway or a major road.
