Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a black truck driving on a road at night. The road appears to be an on-off ramp, as there is a barrier in the middle of the road, and the truck is driving on the left side of the road, which is typical of an on-off ramp. Additionally, there are no other vehicles visible in the image, which would be expected on an on-off ramp.
