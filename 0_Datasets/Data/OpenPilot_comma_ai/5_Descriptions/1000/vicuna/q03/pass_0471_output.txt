Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a street at night with cars parked on the side of the road and streetlights illuminating the area. The road appears to be an on-off ramp as there is a solid white line in the middle of the road, indicating that it is a one-way street, and there are no cars driving in the opposite direction. The cars parked on the side of the road also suggest that it is an on-off ramp.
