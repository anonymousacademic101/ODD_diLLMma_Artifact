Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a parking lot with several cars parked in it. The cars are parked in such a way that they are not blocking any other cars from entering or leaving the parking lot. The cars are parked parallel to each other and there is enough space between them to allow other cars to pass through. The image also shows a building in the background, which suggests that this is a parking lot in front of a store or other commercial establishment.
