Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The on-off ramp is a type of road that allows vehicles to enter or exit a controlled-access highway, such as a freeway or expressway. On-off ramps are typically located at interchanges, where two or more highways meet. They are designed to provide a safe and efficient way for vehicles to enter or exit the highway while minimizing the impact on traffic flow.

On-off ramps typically have two lanes: one for vehicles entering the highway, and one for vehicles exiting the highway. They may also have additional lanes for turning or merging traffic. The ramps are designed with a gradual incline to help vehicles gain speed and momentum as they enter or exit the highway.

On-off ramps play an important role in maintaining the flow of traffic on controlled-access highways. They help to reduce congestion and delays by allowing vehicles to enter and exit the highway smoothly and efficiently. They also help to ensure the safety of drivers and passengers by providing a clear and well-marked route for entering and exiting the highway.
