Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The on-off ramp is a type of road that allows vehicles to enter or exit a controlled-access highway, such as a freeway or motorway. On-off ramps are typically located at interchanges, where two or more highways meet. They are designed to provide a safe and efficient way for vehicles to enter or exit the highway, while minimizing the impact on traffic flow.

On-off ramps typically have two lanes: one for vehicles entering the highway, and one for vehicles exiting the highway. They may also have additional lanes for turning or merging traffic. The lanes are separated by a median or barrier to prevent head-on collisions between vehicles traveling in opposite directions.

On-off ramps are important for maintaining the flow of traffic on controlled-access highways, as they allow vehicles to enter or exit the highway without disrupting the flow of traffic on the mainline. They also help to reduce congestion and delays on the highway, as well as improve safety by reducing the risk of accidents.
