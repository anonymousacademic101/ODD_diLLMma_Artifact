Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The on-off ramp is a type of road that allows vehicles to enter or exit a controlled-access highway, such as a freeway or motorway. On-off ramps typically have traffic signals or signs to control the flow of traffic and ensure the safety of drivers and pedestrians.
