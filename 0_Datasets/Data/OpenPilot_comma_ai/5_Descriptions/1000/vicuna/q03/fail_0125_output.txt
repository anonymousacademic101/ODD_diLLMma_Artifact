Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The on-off ramp is a type of road that allows vehicles to enter or exit a controlled-access highway, such as a freeway or expressway. On-off ramps are typically located at interchanges, where two or more highways meet. They are designed to allow vehicles to smoothly transition from one highway to another, while minimizing the impact on traffic flow.

On-off ramps typically have two lanes: one for vehicles entering the highway, and one for vehicles exiting the highway. They may also have acceleration and deceleration lanes, which allow vehicles to build up speed or slow down before merging onto the highway.

On-off ramps are important for maintaining the flow of traffic on controlled-access highways, as they allow vehicles to enter and exit the highway without disrupting the flow of traffic on the main lanes. They also help to reduce congestion and improve safety by allowing vehicles to merge onto the highway at a controlled speed.
