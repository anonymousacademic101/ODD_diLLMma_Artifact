Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a road at night with streetlights and trees on either side of the road. The road appears to be an on-off ramp as there is a concrete barrier in the middle of the road, indicating that traffic can enter or exit the ramp but not both at the same time. The road also has a yellow line down the middle, which is a common feature of on-off ramps.
