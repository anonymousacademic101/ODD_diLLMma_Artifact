Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The on-off ramp is a type of road that allows vehicles to enter or exit a controlled-access highway, such as a freeway or motorway. On-off ramps are typically located at interchanges, where two or more highways meet. They are designed to allow traffic to flow smoothly between the highways and to reduce the risk of accidents.

On-off ramps typically have two lanes, one for traffic entering the highway and one for traffic exiting the highway. They may also have acceleration and deceleration lanes, which allow vehicles to build up speed before merging onto the highway or slow down before exiting the highway.

On-off ramps are an important part of controlled-access highway systems, as they help to manage traffic flow and ensure the safety of drivers and other road users.
