Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The on-off ramp is a type of interchange that allows traffic to enter or exit a controlled-access highway, such as a freeway or motorway. On-off ramps are typically used to connect local roads to controlled-access highways, allowing drivers to enter or exit the highway at specific locations.

On-off ramps typically have two lanes: one for traffic entering the highway, and one for traffic exiting the highway. They are designed to provide a smooth and safe transition between the local road and the controlled-access highway, allowing drivers to enter or exit the highway at a controlled speed without having to merge with traffic on the highway.

On-off ramps are an important feature of controlled-access highways, as they allow drivers to access destinations along the highway without having to travel the entire length of the highway. They also help to reduce congestion on the highway by allowing drivers to exit the highway at specific locations rather than continuing to travel on the highway until they reach their destination.
