Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The on-off ramp is a type of road that allows vehicles to enter or exit a controlled-access highway, such as a freeway or motorway. On-off ramps are typically located at interchanges, where two or more highways meet. They are designed to allow vehicles to smoothly transition from one highway to another, or from the highway to an adjacent road or parking lot.

On-off ramps typically have two lanes: one for traffic entering the highway, and one for traffic exiting the highway. They may also have acceleration and deceleration lanes, which allow vehicles to build up speed or slow down before merging onto the highway or exiting the highway.

On-off ramps are an important feature of controlled-access highways, as they help to maintain the flow of traffic and prevent accidents. They also make it easier for drivers to navigate the highway network and reach their destinations more efficiently.
