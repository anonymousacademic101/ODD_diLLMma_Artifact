Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The on-off ramp is a type of road that allows vehicles to enter or exit a controlled-access highway, such as a freeway or motorway. On-off ramps are typically located at interchanges, where multiple highways or roads converge. They are designed to provide a safe and efficient way for vehicles to enter or exit the highway while minimizing the impact on traffic flow.

On-off ramps typically have two lanes: one for vehicles entering the highway, and one for vehicles exiting the highway. They may also have additional lanes for turning or merging traffic. The ramps are designed to provide a smooth and gradual transition between the highway and the adjacent road, allowing vehicles to safely accelerate or decelerate as they enter or exit the highway.

On-off ramps play an important role in maintaining the flow of traffic on controlled-access highways. They help to reduce congestion and delays by allowing vehicles to enter and exit the highway in a controlled and orderly manner. They also help to improve safety by reducing the likelihood of accidents caused by vehicles merging or entering the highway at high speeds.
