Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The on-off ramp is a section of a highway or road that allows vehicles to enter or exit the highway or road. On-off ramps are typically used at interchanges, where multiple highways or roads intersect. They are designed to allow vehicles to smoothly enter or exit the highway or road without disrupting the flow of traffic.

On-off ramps typically have two lanes: one for vehicles entering the highway or road, and one for vehicles exiting. They may also have a third lane for vehicles waiting to enter or exit. The lanes are separated by a median, which helps to prevent head-on collisions between vehicles traveling in opposite directions.

On-off ramps are important for the safe and efficient flow of traffic on highways and roads. They help to reduce congestion and prevent accidents by allowing vehicles to enter and exit the highway or road in a controlled and orderly manner.
