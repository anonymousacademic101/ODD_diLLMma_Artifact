Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The on-off ramp is a road that allows vehicles to enter or exit a controlled-access highway, such as a freeway or motorway. The road we are driving on appears to be an on-off ramp, as it has a divider in the middle and arrows pointing in different directions, indicating which lanes lead to the on-ramp and which lead to the off-ramp.
