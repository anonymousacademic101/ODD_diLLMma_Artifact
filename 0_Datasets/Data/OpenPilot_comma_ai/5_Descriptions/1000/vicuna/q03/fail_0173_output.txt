No, the road we are driving on is not an on-off ramp.

The image shows a car driving on a city street with other cars parked on the side of the road. There is a crosswalk in front of the car, and a store with a sign that says "Coffee Shop" in the background. The road appears to be a regular city street, and there is no indication that it is an on-off ramp.
