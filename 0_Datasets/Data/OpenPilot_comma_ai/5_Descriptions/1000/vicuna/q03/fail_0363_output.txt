Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The on-off ramp is a type of road that allows vehicles to enter or exit a highway or other major roadway. On-off ramps are typically found at interchanges, where one road intersects with another. They are designed to allow vehicles to smoothly transition from one road to another, reducing the risk of accidents and traffic congestion.

On-off ramps typically have two lanes: one for vehicles entering the highway or other major roadway, and one for vehicles exiting. They may also have an acceleration lane, which allows vehicles to build up speed before merging onto the highway or other major roadway.

On-off ramps play an important role in maintaining the flow of traffic on roads and highways. They help to reduce congestion and ensure that vehicles can move smoothly and safely between different roads and highways.
