Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a silver car driving on a road that appears to be an on-off ramp. The car is driving on the right side of the road and there is a barrier on the left side of the road. The road appears to be an on-off ramp because it has an entrance and exit, and the car is driving on it as if it is entering or exiting the highway.
