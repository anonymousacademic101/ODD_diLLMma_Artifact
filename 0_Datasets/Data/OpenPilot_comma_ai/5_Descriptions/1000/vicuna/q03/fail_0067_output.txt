Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a car driving on a road that appears to be an on-off ramp. The ramp is made of concrete and has stairs leading up to it.

The lighting in the image is dim, with only a small amount of light coming from the top of the ramp. The car's headlights are on, illuminating the area in front of the car. The image is taken from a low angle, looking up at the car as it drives towards the top of the ramp.
