Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The on-off ramp is a type of road that allows vehicles to enter or exit a controlled-access highway, such as a toll road or a controlled-access highway. On-off ramps are typically located at interchanges, where two or more highways meet. They are designed to allow vehicles to smoothly enter or exit the highway without disrupting the flow of traffic on the highway.

On-off ramps typically have two lanes: one for vehicles entering the highway, and one for vehicles exiting the highway. They also often have a deceleration lane, which allows vehicles to slow down before merging onto the highway or exiting the highway.

On-off ramps are important for maintaining the flow of traffic on controlled-access highways and ensuring the safety of drivers and other road users.
