Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The on-off ramp is a type of road that allows vehicles to enter or exit a highway or other major roadway. On-off ramps are typically used at interchanges, where multiple highways or roads converge. They are designed to allow traffic to flow smoothly and safely between the different roadways.

On-off ramps typically have two lanes, one for traffic entering the highway or roadway, and one for traffic exiting. They may also have a shoulder or emergency lane for vehicles that need to pull over or make a u-turn.

On-off ramps are important for maintaining the flow of traffic and ensuring the safety of drivers and passengers. They help to reduce congestion and delays on the road, and can help to prevent accidents by providing a clear and well-marked area for vehicles to enter and exit the roadway.
