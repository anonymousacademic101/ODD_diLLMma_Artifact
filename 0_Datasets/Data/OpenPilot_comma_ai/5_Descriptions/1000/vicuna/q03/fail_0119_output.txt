Yes, the road in the image appears to be an on-off ramp.

The on-off ramp is a type of road that allows vehicles to enter or exit a controlled-access highway, such as a freeway or motorway. The road in the image appears to be an on-off ramp because it has a barrier in the middle to prevent vehicles from entering or exiting the highway at unauthorized locations. The barrier is up when the ramp is closed, and down when the ramp is open.
