Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The on-off ramp is a type of road that allows vehicles to enter or exit a controlled-access highway, such as a freeway or motorway. On-off ramps are typically located at interchanges, where two or more highways meet. They are designed to allow traffic to flow smoothly between the highways and to reduce the risk of accidents.

On-off ramps typically have two lanes, one for traffic entering the highway and one for traffic exiting the highway. They may also have additional lanes for turning or merging traffic. The lanes on an on-off ramp are typically separated by a median, which helps to prevent head-on collisions between vehicles traveling in opposite directions.

On-off ramps are an important part of controlled-access highway systems, as they allow drivers to easily enter and exit the highway and to travel to their desired destinations. They also help to reduce traffic congestion and improve the flow of traffic on the highways.
