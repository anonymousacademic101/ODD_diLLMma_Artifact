Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The on-off ramp is a type of road that allows vehicles to enter or exit a controlled-access highway, such as a toll road or a controlled-access highway. On-off ramps are typically located at interchanges, which are places where two or more highways meet and traffic can change direction. The on-off ramp is designed to allow vehicles to enter or exit the controlled-access highway safely and efficiently.

On-off ramps are important for traffic flow and safety on controlled-access highways. They help to reduce congestion and delays on the highway by allowing vehicles to enter and exit the highway at specific locations. They also help to reduce the risk of accidents by providing a safe place for vehicles to slow down and make their way onto or off of the highway.

Overall, the on-off ramp is an important feature of controlled-access highways that helps to improve traffic flow and safety.
