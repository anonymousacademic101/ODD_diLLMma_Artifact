Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The image shows a black car driving on a road that appears to be an on-off ramp. The car is driving towards the camera, and there is a building in the background on the left side of the image. The road appears to be a city street with other cars and buildings visible in the distance.

Based on the image, it is clear that the road is an on-off ramp. The car is driving on the ramp, which is an elevated section of the road that allows vehicles to enter or exit the highway. The presence of the building in the background and other cars on the road further confirms that this is a city street with an on-off ramp.

Therefore, the answer to the question is YES.
