Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The on-off ramp is a type of road that allows vehicles to enter or exit a controlled-access highway, such as a freeway or expressway. On-off ramps are typically located at interchanges, where two or more highways meet. They are designed to allow vehicles to smoothly transition from one highway to another, or from the highway to an adjacent road or parking lot.

On-off ramps typically have two lanes: one for vehicles entering the highway, and one for vehicles exiting the highway. They may also have additional lanes for turning or merging traffic. The ramps themselves are typically inclined, allowing vehicles to gain or lose speed as they travel up or down the ramp.

On-off ramps play an important role in the flow of traffic on controlled-access highways. They allow vehicles to enter and exit the highway safely and efficiently, reducing congestion and improving the overall flow of traffic.
