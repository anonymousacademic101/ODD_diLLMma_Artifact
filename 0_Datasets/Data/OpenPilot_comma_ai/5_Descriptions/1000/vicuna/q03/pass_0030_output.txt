Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The on-off ramp is a road that allows vehicles to enter or exit a highway. It is typically located at the end of a highway or at an interchange where two or more highways meet. The on-off ramp is designed to allow vehicles to smoothly transition from the highway to the local road or vice versa.

On-off ramps are important for traffic flow and safety. They help to reduce congestion on the highway by allowing vehicles to enter and exit at specific locations rather than weaving in and out of traffic. They also help to reduce the risk of accidents by providing a designated area for vehicles to slow down and make their way onto or off of the highway.

Overall, the on-off ramp in the image is a typical example of this type of road feature.
