Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The on-off ramp is a section of a highway or road that allows vehicles to enter or exit the highway or road. On-off ramps are typically used at interchanges, where multiple highways or roads converge. They are designed to allow vehicles to smoothly enter or exit the highway or road, reducing the risk of accidents and congestion.

On-off ramps typically have two lanes: one for vehicles entering the highway or road, and one for vehicles exiting. They may also have acceleration or deceleration lanes, which allow vehicles to build up or reduce speed before merging onto the highway or road.

On-off ramps are important for the safe and efficient flow of traffic on highways and roads. They help to reduce congestion and the risk of accidents, and make it easier for drivers to navigate the road network.
