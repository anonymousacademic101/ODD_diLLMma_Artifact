Yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.

The on-off ramp is a type of road that allows vehicles to enter or exit a controlled-access highway, such as a freeway or motorway. On-off ramps are typically located at interchanges, where multiple highways or roads converge. They are designed to provide a safe and efficient way for vehicles to enter or exit the highway while minimizing disruptions to traffic flow.

On-off ramps typically have two lanes: one for vehicles entering the highway, and one for vehicles exiting the highway. They also often have a median divider to separate the two lanes and prevent head-on collisions. In addition, on-off ramps often have traffic signals or signs to help regulate traffic flow and ensure that vehicles enter and exit the highway in a safe and orderly manner.

Overall, on-off ramps play an important role in the functioning of controlled-access highways and help to ensure the safety and efficiency of traffic flow.
