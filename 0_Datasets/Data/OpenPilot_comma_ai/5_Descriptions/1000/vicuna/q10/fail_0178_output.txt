The image shows a city street with cars parked on both sides of the road. The road has two lanes, one for traffic going in each direction. There is a crosswalk in the middle of the road, and a traffic light hanging above it. The street is lined with trees on both sides, and there are buildings visible in the background. It appears to be a sunny day, as there are no clouds in the sky.
