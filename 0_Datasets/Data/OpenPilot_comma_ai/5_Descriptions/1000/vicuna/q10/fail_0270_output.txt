The image shows a dark, empty street at night. The street is lined with tall buildings on both sides, and there are no cars or pedestrians visible. The road surface appears to be made of asphalt, and there are no road signs or traffic lights visible. The time of day is night, as there are no lights on in the buildings or on the street. The image was likely taken with a long exposure, as the lights from the buildings and the stars in the sky are visible.
