The image shows a street scene with buildings on both sides of the road. The buildings appear to be made of concrete and have white paint on them. There is a sidewalk on the left side of the road, and a parking lot on the right side. There are no cars visible in the image, but there are a few people walking on the sidewalk. The time of day appears to be daytime, based on the bright sunlight in the image. There are no road signs visible in the image, but there is a traffic light hanging from the building on the left side of the road.
