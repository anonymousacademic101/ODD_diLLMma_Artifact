This is a video of a highway with cars driving on it. There are several lanes and a median divider in the middle of the road. The cars are driving in both directions, some in the left lane and some in the right lane. There are also some pedestrians walking on the sidewalk next to the road. The time of day appears to be daytime, as there is sunlight shining on the cars and the road. The road signs are not visible in this video.
