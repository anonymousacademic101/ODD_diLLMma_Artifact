This is a video taken from a car driving down a city street at night. The street is lined with tall buildings on both sides and there are streetlights illuminating the area. The road is straight and there are no turns or intersections in sight. There are no other cars on the road, but there are some pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The time of day is night, and the lighting is provided by the streetlights. The weather is clear and there are no obstructions in the view.
