The image shows a busy street at night. The street is lined with tall buildings on both sides, with streetlights illuminating the area. There are several cars parked on the side of the road, and a few pedestrians can be seen walking on the sidewalk. The time of day is night, and the image was likely taken with a long exposure, causing the lights of the streetlights and cars to create streaks of light in the image.
