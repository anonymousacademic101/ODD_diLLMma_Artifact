The image shows a city street with buildings on both sides and a truck driving down the road. The road has two lanes, one for traffic going in each direction. There are no pedestrians visible in the image. The time of day appears to be daytime, as there is sunlight shining on the buildings and the shadows of the buildings are pointing towards the east. The image appears to have been taken from a vehicle driving down the street, as there is a view of the truck's front bumper in the lower left corner of the image. There are no road signs visible in the image.
