This image shows a dark, empty street at night. The road is straight and there are no cars or pedestrians in sight. The only light comes from the street lamps on either side of the road. There is a stop sign on the left side of the road and a yield sign on the right side. The buildings on either side of the road are tall and dark, with no lights on inside. The sky is overcast and there are no stars or moon visible. The time of day is night.
