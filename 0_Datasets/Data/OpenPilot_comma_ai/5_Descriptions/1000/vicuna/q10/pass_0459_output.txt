The image shows a dark street at night with several parked cars on either side of the road. The cars are parked parallel to the road, with their headlights on, illuminating the area around them. The road appears to be straight and narrow, with no visible road markings or signs. There are no pedestrians or other vehicles visible in the image. The time of day is night, as the sky is dark and there are no visible stars or moonlight. The image was likely taken with a long exposure, as the headlights of the cars are trails of light.
