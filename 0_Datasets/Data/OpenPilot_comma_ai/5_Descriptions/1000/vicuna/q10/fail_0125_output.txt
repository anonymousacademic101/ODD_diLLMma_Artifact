The image shows a group of cars parked on the side of a road at night. The cars are parked in a straight line, with their headlights on, illuminating the area around them. The road appears to be a city street, with streetlights on either side of the road. There are no pedestrians visible in the image. The time of day is night, as indicated by the darkness and the presence of streetlights. The image was likely taken from a vehicle traveling down the road, as there is a glare on the windshield of the car in the foreground.
