This image shows a dark, empty street at night. The street is lined with tall buildings on both sides, and there are no cars or pedestrians visible. The road is straight and narrow, with a yellow center line down the middle. There are no road signs or traffic lights visible. The time of day is night, as there are no lights on in the buildings or on the street. The image is taken from a car driving down the street, with the headlights illuminating the road ahead.
