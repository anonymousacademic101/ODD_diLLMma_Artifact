It is important to pay attention to the road while driving at night, as visibility may be limited and it can be more difficult to see pedestrians, other vehicles, and road signs.

It is also important to follow traffic laws and regulations, such as speed limits and stop signs, to ensure the safety of both the driver and other road users.
