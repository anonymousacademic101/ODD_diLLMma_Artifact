This image shows a building with a large glass front entrance. The building appears to be made of concrete and steel, with large windows on the upper floors. There is a parking lot in front of the building, with several cars parked in it. The road in front of the building is a divided highway with two lanes in each direction. There are no pedestrians or other vehicles visible in the image. The time of day appears to be daytime, based on the bright sunlight shining on the building and the shadows cast by the cars in the parking lot.
