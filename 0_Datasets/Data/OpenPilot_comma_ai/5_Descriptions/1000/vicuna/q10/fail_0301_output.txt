This is a video of a road in a mountainous area. The road is narrow and winding, with a guardrail on one side and a steep drop on the other. There are no other vehicles on the road, but there are some pedestrians walking on the side of the road. The sky is clear and blue, and there are mountains in the distance. The time of day appears to be morning, as the sun is just starting to rise over the mountains. There are no road signs visible in the video.
