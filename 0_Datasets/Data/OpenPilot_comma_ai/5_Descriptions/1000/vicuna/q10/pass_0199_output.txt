This is a video of a car driving down a dark road at night. The road is straight and there are no turns or intersections in sight. The car's headlights are on, illuminating the road ahead. There are no other vehicles on the road, and there are no pedestrians or other obstacles in the way. The time of day is night, and the sky is dark, with no moon or stars visible. There are no streetlights or other sources of light on the road. The video is shot from the perspective of someone in the car, looking out the front window.
