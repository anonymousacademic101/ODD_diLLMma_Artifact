The image shows a parking lot with several cars parked in it. There is a concrete divider in the middle of the parking lot, separating it into two sections. On the left side of the image, there is a building with white walls and a red roof. The building has several windows, and there is a sign on the wall that says "Coffee Shop". On the right side of the image, there is a road with a yellow line down the middle. There are no cars on the road, but there are several pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The time of day appears to be morning, as there are no shadows on the ground.
