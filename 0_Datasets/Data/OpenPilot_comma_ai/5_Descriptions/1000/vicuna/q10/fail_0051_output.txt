The image shows a city street with a crosswalk in the middle of the road. On the left side of the road, there is a line of parked cars, and on the right side, there is a row of buildings with shops on the ground floor and residential apartments on the upper floors. The road has two lanes for traffic, one for each direction, and there are no pedestrians or other vehicles visible in the image. The time of day appears to be daytime, as there are people walking on the sidewalk and cars parked on the street. The weather seems to be sunny, as there are no clouds visible in the sky.
