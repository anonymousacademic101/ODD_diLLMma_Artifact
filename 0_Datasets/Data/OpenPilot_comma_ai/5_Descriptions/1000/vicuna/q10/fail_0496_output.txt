The image shows a street scene with a car parked on the side of the road. The car appears to be a small sedan, likely a Toyota Corolla or similar model. The car is parked in front of a building with shops on the ground floor and residential units above. The building has a white facade with large windows and a blue awning over the entrance.

The road is narrow and lined with parked cars on both sides. There is a yellow line down the center of the road, indicating that it is a one-way street. There are no other vehicles visible in the image, but there are several pedestrians walking on the sidewalk.

It appears to be daytime, as there are no lights on in the building or on the street. The sun is shining and there are no clouds in the sky.

Overall, this is a typical urban street scene with a mix of commercial and residential buildings, parked cars, and pedestrians.
