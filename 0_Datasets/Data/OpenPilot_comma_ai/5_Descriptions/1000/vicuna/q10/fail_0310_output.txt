There is a stop sign on the left side of the road, indicating that traffic on this road must come to a stop before proceeding. There is also a yield sign on the right side of the road, indicating that traffic on the right must yield to traffic on the left.

The sky in the image is overcast, with clouds covering the sun. The time of day is likely morning or afternoon, as the shadows in the image suggest that the sun is either rising or setting.
