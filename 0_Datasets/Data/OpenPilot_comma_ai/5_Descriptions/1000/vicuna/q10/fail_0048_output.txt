The image shows a narrow street with buildings on both sides. The buildings are made of bricks and have large windows. The street is lined with green garbage bins and there are no cars parked on the street. The pavement is made of cobblestones and there are no visible road markings or signs. The time of day appears to be late afternoon, as there are shadows on the pavement and the sun is setting behind the buildings. There are no pedestrians visible in the image.
