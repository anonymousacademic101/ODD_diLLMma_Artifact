The image shows a street at night with a car parked on the side of the road. The car is a small, white sedan with tinted windows. There are no other cars on the road, and there are no pedestrians visible. The street is lined with trees on both sides, and there are streetlights illuminating the area. The time of day appears to be night, as the sky is dark and there are no visible stars. The image appears to have been taken from a moving vehicle, as there is a blur effect in the background.
