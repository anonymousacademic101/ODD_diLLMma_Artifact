The image shows a city street with cars parked on both sides of the road. There is a crosswalk in the middle of the road, and a traffic light hanging above it. On the left side of the road, there is a row of buildings with shops on the ground floor and apartments on the upper floors. There are people walking on the sidewalk and crossing the street at the crosswalk. The time of day appears to be daytime, as there are no lights on in the buildings and the sun is shining brightly.
