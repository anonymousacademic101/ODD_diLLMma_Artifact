This is a photograph of a city street, taken from a car driving down the street. The street is lined with tall buildings on both sides, and there are several cars parked on the side of the road. The road has two lanes, one for traffic going in each direction, and there are yellow lines down the center of the road. There are no pedestrians visible in the photograph. The time of day is likely during the day, as there are no lights on in the buildings and the sun is shining.
