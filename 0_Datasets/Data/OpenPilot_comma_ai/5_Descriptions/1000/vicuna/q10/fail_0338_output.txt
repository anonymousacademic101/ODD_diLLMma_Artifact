The image shows a city street with cars parked on both sides of the road. The road has two lanes, one for traffic going in each direction. There are no pedestrians visible in the image. The sky is cloudy and it appears to be daytime. There are no road signs visible in the image. The street is lined with buildings on both sides, some of which have shops on the ground floor. The buildings have different architectural styles, some of them are old and some are modern. There is a traffic light on the right side of the image, but it is not clear if it is functioning or not. The image is taken from a car driving down the street, so the perspective is from the driver's point of view.
