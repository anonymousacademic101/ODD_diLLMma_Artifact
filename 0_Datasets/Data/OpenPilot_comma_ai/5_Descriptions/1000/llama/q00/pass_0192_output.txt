Yes, this image has poor visibility like heavy rain, snow, fog, or adverse weather conditions. The road is empty and there are no other cars or pedestrians visible in the distance. The light from the headlights of the car in front of the camera is reflected on the wet road surface, making it difficult to see the road ahead. Additionally, the darkness of the night makes it difficult to see any details on the road, such as lane markings or road signs.</s>
