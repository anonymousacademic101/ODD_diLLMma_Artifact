The image is of a street at night with a few cars parked on the side of the road. There are streetlights on either side of the road, casting a yellow glow on the pavement. The buildings on either side of the street are dark, with only a few lights on in the windows. There is a car parked in front of one of the buildings, with its headlights shining on the pavement. The image appears to be taken at night, as the sky is dark and there are no stars visible. The only light sources are from the streetlights and the headlights of the car. The image does not appear to have poor visibility due to heavy rain, snow, fog, or adverse weather conditions.</s>
