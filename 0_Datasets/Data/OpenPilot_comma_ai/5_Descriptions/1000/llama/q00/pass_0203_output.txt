Yes, this image has poor visibility like heavy rain, snow, fog, or adverse weather conditions. The road is wet and there are puddles of water on it, which can make it difficult to see the road ahead. Additionally, the lighting is poor, with only the headlights of the car illuminating the road. This can make it difficult to see any obstacles or hazards on the road.</s>
