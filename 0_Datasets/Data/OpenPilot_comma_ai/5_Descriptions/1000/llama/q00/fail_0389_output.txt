The image does not have poor visibility like heavy rain, snow, fog, or adverse weather conditions. It appears to be a nighttime image of a street with a car parked on the side of the road. The light from the car's headlights illuminates the surrounding area, making it difficult to see anything else in the image. Therefore, the answer is NO.</s>
