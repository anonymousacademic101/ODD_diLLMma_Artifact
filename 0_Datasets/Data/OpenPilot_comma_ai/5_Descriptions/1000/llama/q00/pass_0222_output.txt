The image shows a street at night with no cars or pedestrians in sight. The only light source is from the streetlights on either side of the road, casting shadows on the pavement. There is no other light source, such as headlights or streetlights, visible in the image. Therefore, this image does not have poor visibility due to heavy rain, snow, fog, or adverse weather conditions.</s>
