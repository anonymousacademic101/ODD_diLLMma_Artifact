Yes, the image has poor visibility due to the heavy rain. The car's headlights are on, and the windshield wipers are moving to clear the water from the windshield. The road is wet and slippery, and there are puddles of water on the road. The image is taken at night, and the only light source is from the headlights of the car and the streetlights on the side of the road.</s>
