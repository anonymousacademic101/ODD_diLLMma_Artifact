The image is of a street with a car parked on the side of the road. The car has a broken windshield and the driver's side door is open. There is a person standing next to the car, looking at something on the ground. The image is taken from a low angle, looking up at the car and the person. The lighting is poor, with shadows cast by the buildings on either side of the street.</s>
