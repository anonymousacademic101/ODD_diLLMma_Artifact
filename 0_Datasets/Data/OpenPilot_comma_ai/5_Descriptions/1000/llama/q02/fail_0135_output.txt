The image shows a street at night with streetlights on both sides of the road. There is a car parked on the side of the road, and a pedestrian walking on the sidewalk. The sky is dark and there are stars visible in the sky.

Is the road we are driving on a sharp curve?

NO, the road is not a sharp curve. It appears to be a straight road with streetlights on both sides.</s>
