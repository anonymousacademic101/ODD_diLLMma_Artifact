The image shows a street with a stop sign on the corner. The street is dark and there are no cars parked on the side of the road. The stop sign is illuminated by the streetlights on either side of the road.

The answer to your question is NO. The road is not a sharp curve. It appears to be a straight road with a stop sign at the corner.</s>
