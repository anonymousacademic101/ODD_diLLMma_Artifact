The image shows a street with a curb on one side and a sidewalk on the other. There are no cars parked on the street, and the sidewalk appears to be empty. The sky is cloudy and there are no trees or buildings visible in the background.

The answer to your question is NO, the road we are driving on is not a sharp curve. The road appears to be a straight, two-lane road with a curb on one side and a sidewalk on the other. There are no obstacles or hazards visible in the road or the surrounding area.</s>
