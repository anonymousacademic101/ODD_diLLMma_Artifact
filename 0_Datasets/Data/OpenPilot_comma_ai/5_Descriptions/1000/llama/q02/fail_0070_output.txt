The image shows a street with a building on the left side and a car parked on the right side. The building appears to be made of brick and has a large window on the first floor. The car is parked on the sidewalk in front of the building.

Is the road we are driving on a sharp curve?

NO, the road is not a sharp curve. It appears to be a straight road with a building on the left side and a car parked on the right side.</s>
