The image shows a street at night with streetlights on both sides of the road. There is a car parked on the side of the road, and a pedestrian walking down the sidewalk. The image is taken from the perspective of a driver driving down the road at night.

The answer to the question is NO, the road is not a sharp curve. The road is straight and flat, with no sharp turns or bends. The streetlights on both sides of the road provide adequate lighting for the driver to see the road ahead.</s>
