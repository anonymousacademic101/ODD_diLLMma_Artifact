The image shows a driveway leading up to a house with a car parked in front of it. The driveway appears to be made of concrete and there are plants growing on the side of the house. The sky is cloudy and there are no other cars or people visible in the image.

Is the road we are driving on a sharp curve?

NO. The road appears to be a straight line leading up to the house.</s>
