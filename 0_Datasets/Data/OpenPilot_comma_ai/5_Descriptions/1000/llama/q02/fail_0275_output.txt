The image shows a car parked in front of a house with stairs leading up to the front door. The car appears to be a white sedan with a bumper sticker on the rear windshield. The stairs are made of concrete and have handrails on both sides. The house appears to be a two story building with a small balcony on the second floor. There are no other cars or people visible in the image.

The road we are driving on is not a sharp curve. It appears to be a straight road leading up to the house. There are no other cars or obstacles visible in the image.</s>
