The image shows a street with a building on the left side and a parked car on the right side. The building appears to be an office building with windows on the upper floors and a door on the ground floor. The car is parked on the sidewalk in front of the building. There are no other vehicles or pedestrians in the image.

The road runs horizontally across the image, parallel to the building. It appears to be a paved road with a few parked cars on it. There are no other vehicles or pedestrians in the image.

Therefore, the answer to your question is NO, the road does not run horizontally across the image.</s>
