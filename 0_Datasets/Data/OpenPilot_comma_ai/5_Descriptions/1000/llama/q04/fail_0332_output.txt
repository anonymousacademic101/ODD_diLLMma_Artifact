The image shows a red car parked on the side of the road. The car is facing down the street, and there are trees and houses visible in the background. The road appears to run horizontally across the image.

Is the road we are driving on an intersection, or does it run horizontally across the image?

NO, the road does not run horizontally across the image. It appears to be a single lane road that runs down the center of the image.</s>
