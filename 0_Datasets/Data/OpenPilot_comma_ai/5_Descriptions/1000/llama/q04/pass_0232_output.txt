This is an image of a road at night. The road is empty and there are no other cars or pedestrians in sight. The light from the headlights of the car illuminates the road and the surrounding area, creating a dark and eerie atmosphere.

The answer to your question is NO, the road does not run horizontally across the image. It appears to be a straight road that stretches off into the distance. The light from the headlights of the car illuminates the road and the surrounding area, creating a dark and eerie atmosphere.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.</s>
