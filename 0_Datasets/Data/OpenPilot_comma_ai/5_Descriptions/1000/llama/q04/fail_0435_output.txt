The image shows a street with a car parked on the side of the road. The car has its headlights on and the driver is looking back at the camera. The image is taken at night and there are streetlights on either side of the road.

The answer to your question is NO, the road does not run horizontally across the image. The road is parallel to the camera and the car is parked on the side of the road.</s>
