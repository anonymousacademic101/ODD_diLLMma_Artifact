The image shows a red car parked on the side of the road. The car is facing the opposite direction of the traffic, and there is a pedestrian walking on the sidewalk in front of the car. The image is taken from the perspective of a pedestrian walking on the sidewalk. The road is not an intersection, but rather a straight road that runs horizontally across the image. Therefore, the answer is NO.</s>
