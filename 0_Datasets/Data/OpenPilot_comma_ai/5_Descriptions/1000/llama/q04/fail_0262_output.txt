The image shows a street at night with a few cars parked on the side of the road. There are streetlights on both sides of the road, and the buildings on either side of the street are lit up. The image is taken from the perspective of a driver driving down the street at night.

The road is not an intersection, but rather a straight road that runs horizontally across the image.</s>
