The image shows a white car parked in front of a house with a garage door open. There is a driveway leading up to the house and a sidewalk on the left side of the image. The road appears to run horizontally across the image.

Is the road we are driving on an intersection, or does it run horizontally across the image?

NO, the road does not appear to be an intersection. It runs horizontally across the image, leading up to the house.</s>
