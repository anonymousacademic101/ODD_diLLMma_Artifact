The image shows a room with a desk, chair, and other items scattered around. There is a window on the left side of the image and a door on the right side. The room appears to be cluttered and disorganized.

Is the road we are driving on an intersection, or does it run horizontally across the image?

NO, the road does not run horizontally across the image. It appears to be a single lane road that runs from the left side of the image to the right side.</s>
