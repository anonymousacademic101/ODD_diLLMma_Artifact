The image shows a street at night with streetlights on both sides of the road. There is a parked car on the left side of the road and a tree on the right side. The road appears to be empty and there are no pedestrians or other vehicles visible in the image.

The answer to your question is NO, the road does not run horizontally across the image. It appears to be a straight road that runs from the top left corner of the image to the bottom right corner.</s>
