The image shows a car driving on a bridge over a body of water. The car is on the right side of the image, and the water is on the left. The bridge is made of steel girders and supports, and there are no other vehicles or pedestrians visible in the image.

The road we are driving on is not an intersection, as it does not meet with any other roads or intersections. It runs horizontally across the image, from the top of the bridge to the bottom.</s>
