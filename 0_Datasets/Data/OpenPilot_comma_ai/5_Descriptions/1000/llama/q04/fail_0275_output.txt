The image shows a car parked in front of a house with stairs leading up to the front door. The car is parked on the street, and there are no other vehicles visible in the image. The road appears to run horizontally across the image, parallel to the stairs leading up to the front door. Therefore, the answer is NO, the road does not run horizontally across the image.</s>
