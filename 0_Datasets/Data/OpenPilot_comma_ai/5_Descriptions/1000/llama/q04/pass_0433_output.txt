The image shows a street at night with a stop sign on the corner. The street is empty and there are no cars or pedestrians in sight. The stop sign is illuminated by the streetlights on either side of the road.

The answer to your question is NO, the road does not run horizontally across the image. The road is a straight line that runs from the top left corner of the image to the bottom right corner. The stop sign is located at the intersection of the road and the sidewalk.</s>
