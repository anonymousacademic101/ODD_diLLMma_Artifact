The image shows a car parked on the side of a city street. The car is parked on the right side of the road, and there are other cars parked on the left side of the road. The road appears to run horizontally across the image.

Is the road we are driving on an intersection, or does it run horizontally across the image?

NO, the road does not run horizontally across the image. It appears to be a city street with cars parked on both sides of the road.</s>
