The image shows a car parked on the side of a street. The car is parked in front of a building with a sign that reads "gas station." There are no other vehicles or pedestrians in the image. The road appears to run horizontally across the image.

Is the road we are driving on an intersection, or does it run horizontally across the image?

NO, the road does not run horizontally across the image. It appears to be a side street with a gas station on one side and a building on the other.</s>
