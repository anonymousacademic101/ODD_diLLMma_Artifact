This image shows a group of blue recycling bins lined up on the sidewalk in front of a building at night. The bins are illuminated by the light from the street lamps. There are no other vehicles or pedestrians in the image. The time of day appears to be around 9 or 10 pm, based on the shadows cast by the bins and the street lamps. The road structure appears to be a two-lane road with a sidewalk on either side. There are no road signs visible in the image.</s>
