This is an image of a street at night. The road is empty and there are no cars or pedestrians in sight. The streetlights are on, casting a yellow glow on the asphalt. The sidewalk is empty and there are no pedestrians in sight. The buildings on either side of the street are dark and there are no lights on in any of them. The time of day is unknown, but it appears to be late at night based on the shadows cast by the streetlights.</s>
