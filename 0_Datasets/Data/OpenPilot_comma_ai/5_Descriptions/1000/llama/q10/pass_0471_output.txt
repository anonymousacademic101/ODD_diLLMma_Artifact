This is an image of a street at night. There are two cars parked on the side of the road, one on the left and one on the right. There are also two pedestrians walking on the sidewalk, one on the left and one on the right. The streetlights are on, illuminating the road and sidewalk. The time of day is unknown, but it appears to be nighttime based on the shadows cast by the streetlights. There are no other vehicles or pedestrians visible in the image.</s>
