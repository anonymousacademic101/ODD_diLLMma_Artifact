This image shows a person standing on the sidewalk in front of a brick building. The person is wearing a black and white striped shirt and black pants, and has a black backpack on their back. The building appears to be a multi-story apartment complex with balconies on each floor. There is a car parked in front of the building, and a bicycle leaning against the railing of the balcony on the left side of the image. The sky is cloudy and there is snow on the ground. The time of day appears to be early morning or late afternoon based on the shadows cast by the buildings and the position of the sun. There are no other pedestrians or vehicles visible in the image.</s>
