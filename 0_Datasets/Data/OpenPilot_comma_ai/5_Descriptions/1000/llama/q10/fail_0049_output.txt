This image shows a street scene with a car parked on the side of the road. The car is a small, white hatchback with tinted windows and a black bumper. The car is parked next to a fire hydrant and a stop sign. There is a pedestrian walking down the sidewalk on the other side of the street. The sky is cloudy and there are some trees and buildings in the background. The time of day is likely early morning or late afternoon, as there are no other cars on the street and the shadows are long.</s>
