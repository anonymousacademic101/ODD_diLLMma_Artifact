This image shows a busy highway with multiple cars driving in both directions. The road is divided into two lanes, with one lane in each direction. There are several cars parked on the side of the road, and a few pedestrians can be seen walking along the sidewalk. The sky is cloudy and there is a light breeze blowing. The time of day is unclear, but it appears to be during the day based on the shadows cast by the trees and buildings in the background.</s>
