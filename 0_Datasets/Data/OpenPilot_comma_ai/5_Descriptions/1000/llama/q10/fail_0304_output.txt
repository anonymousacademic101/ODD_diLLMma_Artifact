This image shows a street with a pothole in the middle of the road. The pothole is surrounded by dirt and debris, and there are no cars or pedestrians in sight. The sky is cloudy and there is a fence on the left side of the road. The time of day is unclear, but it appears to be early morning or late afternoon based on the shadows on the buildings in the background.</s>
