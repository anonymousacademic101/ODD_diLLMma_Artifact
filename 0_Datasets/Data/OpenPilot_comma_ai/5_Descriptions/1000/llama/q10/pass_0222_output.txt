This is an image of a street at night. The road is empty and there are no cars or pedestrians in sight. The streetlights are on, casting a bright glow on the asphalt. The sky is dark and cloudy, with a few stars visible in the distance. The time of day is unknown, but it appears to be late at night based on the shadows cast by the streetlights.</s>
