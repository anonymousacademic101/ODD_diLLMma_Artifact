This is an image of a street at night. There are two cars parked on the side of the road, one on the left and one on the right. The cars are both black and have their headlights on. There are no pedestrians in the image. The time of day appears to be around 9 or 10 pm, as there are streetlights on the road and the sky is dark. The road is straight and there are no obstacles in the way of the cars.</s>
