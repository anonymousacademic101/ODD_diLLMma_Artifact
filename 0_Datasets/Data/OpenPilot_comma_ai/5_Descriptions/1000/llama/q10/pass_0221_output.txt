This is an image of a street at night. The road is empty and there are no cars or pedestrians in sight. The streetlights are on, casting a bright glow on the asphalt. The sky is dark and cloudy, with a few stars visible in the distance. There are no buildings or other structures visible in the image. The time of day appears to be around midnight, based on the position of the sun and the shadows cast by the streetlights.</s>
