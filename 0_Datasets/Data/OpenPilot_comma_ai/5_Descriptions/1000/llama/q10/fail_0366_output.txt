This is an image of a street at night. There are several cars parked along the side of the road, and a few pedestrians are walking down the sidewalk. The road is made of asphalt and has a few potholes and cracks in it. There are streetlights on either side of the road, casting a dim glow over the area. The sky is dark and cloudy, with a few stars visible in the distance. The time of day is difficult to determine, but it appears to be late at night or early in the morning.</s>
