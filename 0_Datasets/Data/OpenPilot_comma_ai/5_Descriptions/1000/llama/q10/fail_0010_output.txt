This image shows a construction site with a large pile of dirt and debris in the middle of the road. There are several orange cones set up along the side of the road to mark the area where the construction is taking place. There are also several workers in hard hats and safety vests standing near the pile of dirt, looking at something on the ground. The sky is cloudy and there is a light drizzle of rain falling in the background. The time of day is likely early morning or late afternoon, as there are no cars or pedestrians visible in the image.</s>
