The walls are painted a dark color and there are no windows in the room. The floor is made of hardwood and there are no rugs or carpets in the room. The lighting in the room is provided by a lamp on the coffee table and the fire in the fireplace. There are no other sources of light in the room. The time of day is difficult to determine from the image, but it appears to be nighttime based on the shadows on the walls and the fire burning in the fireplace.
