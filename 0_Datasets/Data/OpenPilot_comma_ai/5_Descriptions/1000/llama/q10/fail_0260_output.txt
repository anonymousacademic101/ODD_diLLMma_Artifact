This is an image of a street at night. The road is empty and there are no cars or pedestrians in sight. The streetlights are on, casting a yellowish glow on the asphalt. The sky is dark and cloudy, with a few stars visible in the distance. There is a fire hydrant on the left side of the road, and a stop sign on the right side. The time of day is unknown, but it appears to be late at night based on the darkness of the sky.</s>
