This image shows a street with a few cars parked on the side of the road. There are also some pedestrians walking down the sidewalk. The buildings on either side of the street appear to be old and run down, with broken windows and graffiti on the walls. The time of day appears to be early morning, as there are no cars on the road and the streetlights are still on.</s>
