This image shows a dark and empty road at night. The road is straight and lined with trees on both sides. There are no cars or pedestrians in sight, and the only light comes from the headlights of a car driving down the road. The sky is dark and cloudy, with a few stars visible in the distance. The time of day is unknown, but it appears to be late at night based on the darkness of the sky and the lack of activity on the road.</s>
