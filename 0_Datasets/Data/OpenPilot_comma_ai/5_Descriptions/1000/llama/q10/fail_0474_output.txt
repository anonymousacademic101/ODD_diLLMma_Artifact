This is an image of a street with a few cars parked on the side of the road. There are no pedestrians in sight, and the time of day appears to be during the day. The road appears to be in good condition, with no potholes or other damage. The buildings on either side of the road are made of brick and appear to be several stories tall. There is a fire hydrant on the corner of the street.</s>
