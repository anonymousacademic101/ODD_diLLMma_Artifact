This image shows a street at night with a few cars parked on the side of the road. There are streetlights on either side of the road, casting a bright glow on the pavement. The buildings on either side of the street are dark, with only a few windows lit up inside. There are no pedestrians or other vehicles visible in the image. The time of day appears to be late at night or early in the morning, based on the shadows cast by the streetlights and the darkness of the buildings.</s>
