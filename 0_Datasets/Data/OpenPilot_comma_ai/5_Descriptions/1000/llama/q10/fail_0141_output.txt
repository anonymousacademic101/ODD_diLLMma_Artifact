This is an image of a street scene at night. There is a car parked on the side of the road, and the headlights of the car are shining brightly. There are also streetlights on the side of the road, which are also shining brightly. The sky is dark and there are stars visible in the sky. There is a building on the left side of the road, and there are people walking on the sidewalk in front of the building. The time of day is likely late at night or early in the morning, as there are no other cars or pedestrians visible in the image. The lighting in the image is primarily from the headlights of the car and the streetlights, with some additional light coming from the windows of the building.</s>
