This is an image of a street with a car parked on the side of the road. The car has a broken windshield and the driver's side door is open. There is a pedestrian walking down the sidewalk on the other side of the street. The sky is cloudy and there are no other cars or pedestrians in the image. The time of day is difficult to determine, but it appears to be during the day.</s>
