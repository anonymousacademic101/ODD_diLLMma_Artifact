This is an image of a road at night. The road is empty and there are no cars or pedestrians in sight. The sky is dark and cloudy, with a few stars visible in the sky. There are streetlights on both sides of the road, casting a dim glow on the asphalt. The road is straight and flat, with no curves or bends in sight. There are no road signs or markings visible in the image. The time of day appears to be around midnight, based on the position of the sun and the shadows cast by the streetlights.</s>
