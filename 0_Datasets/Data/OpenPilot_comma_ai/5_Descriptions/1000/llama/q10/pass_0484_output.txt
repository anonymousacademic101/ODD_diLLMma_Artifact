This image shows a highway at night with cars driving in both directions. There are streetlights on both sides of the road, and some cars have their headlights on. There are also pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The time of day appears to be late at night or early in the morning, as the sky is dark and there are few cars on the road.</s>
