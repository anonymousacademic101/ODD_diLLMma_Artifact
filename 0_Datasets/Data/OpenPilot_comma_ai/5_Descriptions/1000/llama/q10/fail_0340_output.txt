This image shows a black SUV parked on the side of the road next to a white car. The SUV has its hazard lights on and is parked at an angle, while the white car is parked parallel to the road. There are no other vehicles or pedestrians visible in the image. The sky is cloudy and there are no trees or buildings visible in the background. The time of day is difficult to determine, but it appears to be during the day based on the shadows cast by the SUV and the white car. There are no road signs or markings visible in the image.</s>
