This is an image of a street at night. There are several cars parked on the side of the road, and some people are walking down the sidewalk. There are streetlights on both sides of the road, casting shadows on the pavement. The sky is dark and cloudy, with some stars visible in the distance. The time of day appears to be around midnight, based on the position of the sun and the shadows on the ground.</s>
