This is an image of a road at night. The road is empty and there are no cars or pedestrians in sight. The sky is cloudy and there is a full moon shining down on the road. The road is wet and there are puddles of water on it. There are streetlights on both sides of the road, casting a dim glow on the asphalt. The time of day appears to be around midnight, based on the position of the sun and the shadows cast by the streetlights.</s>
