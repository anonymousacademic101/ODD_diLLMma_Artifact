This is an image of a city street at night. There are several cars driving down the road, and there are also pedestrians walking on the sidewalk. The streetlights are on, illuminating the road and sidewalk. There are also billboards and advertisements on the buildings on either side of the street. The time of day appears to be around 10 or 11 pm, based on the position of the sun and the shadows on the buildings.</s>
