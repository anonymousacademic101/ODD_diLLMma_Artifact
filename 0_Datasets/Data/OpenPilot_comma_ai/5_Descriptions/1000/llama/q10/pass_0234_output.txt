This is a nighttime image of an empty road with no cars or pedestrians in sight. The road is illuminated by streetlights on both sides, casting a dim glow on the asphalt. The sky above is dark and cloudy, with a few stars visible in the distance. There are no other vehicles or pedestrians visible in the image. The time of day appears to be around midnight, based on the darkness of the sky and the lack of activity on the road.</s>
