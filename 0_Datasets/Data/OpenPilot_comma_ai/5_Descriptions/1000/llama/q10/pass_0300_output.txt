This image shows a dark and empty room with a whiteboard on the wall. The whiteboard has some writing on it, but it is difficult to make out what it says due to the poor lighting in the room. There is a desk in the corner of the room with some papers and a pen on it. There is also a chair in the corner of the room with a person sitting in it. The person is wearing a black shirt and pants, and their face is obscured by shadows. The room is dimly lit, with only a small amount of light coming from a window on the opposite side of the room. There are no other objects or people visible in the room.</s>
