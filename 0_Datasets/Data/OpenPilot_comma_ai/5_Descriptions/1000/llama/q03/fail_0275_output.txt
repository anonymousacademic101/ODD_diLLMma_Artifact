The image shows a car parked in front of a house with a driveway leading up to it. The car appears to be a white sedan with tinted windows and a sunroof. There are no other vehicles parked in the driveway or on the street. The house appears to be a single story with a small front porch and a garage. There are no other buildings or structures visible in the image.

The road we are driving on is not an on-off ramp. It appears to be a residential street with houses on both sides and a sidewalk running along the edge of the road. There are no signs or markings indicating that it is an on-off ramp.</s>
