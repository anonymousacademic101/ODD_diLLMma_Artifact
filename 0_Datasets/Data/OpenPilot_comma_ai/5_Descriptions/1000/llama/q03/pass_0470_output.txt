The image shows a street at night with cars parked on the side of the road. There are no pedestrians or other vehicles visible in the image.

The road appears to be an on-off ramp, as there is a sign on the side of the road indicating that it is an on-off ramp. The sign is not visible in the image, but it can be inferred based on the location of the road and the presence of a sign on the side of the road.

Therefore, the answer is YES, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.</s>
