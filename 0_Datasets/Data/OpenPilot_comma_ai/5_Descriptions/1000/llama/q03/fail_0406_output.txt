The image shows a dark road at night with streetlights on both sides. There is a car parked on the side of the road with its headlights on. The grass on the side of the road is illuminated by the streetlights.

Is the road we are driving on an on-off ramp?

NO, the road is not an on-off ramp. It appears to be a regular road with streetlights on both sides.</s>
