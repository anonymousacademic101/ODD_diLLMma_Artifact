The image shows a dark road with headlights on both sides. It appears to be an on-off ramp, as there are two lanes of traffic on the left and one lane on the right. The lights on the left side of the road are on, indicating that traffic is moving in that direction. The lights on the right side of the road are off, indicating that traffic is not moving in that direction. Therefore, the answer is yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.</s>
