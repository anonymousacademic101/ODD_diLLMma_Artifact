The image shows a road with a barrier in the middle of it. The barrier is made of orange cones and has a sign on it that says "Road Closed". The road is surrounded by buildings on both sides and there are cars parked on the side of the road. The sky is clear and there are no clouds in sight.

The answer to your question is NO, the road is not an on-off ramp. The barrier in the middle of the road indicates that it is closed to traffic.</s>
