The image shows a street at night with a few cars parked on the side of the road. There are no pedestrians or other vehicles visible in the image.

The road appears to be an on-off ramp, as there is a sign on the side of the road indicating that it is an on-off ramp. The sign is illuminated by streetlights, which are also visible in the image.

Therefore, the answer to the question is yes, the road we are driving on is an on-off ramp.</s>
