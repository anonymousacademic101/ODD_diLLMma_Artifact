The image shows a street with a crosswalk in the middle of the road. There are no cars or pedestrians in the image, and the lighting is dim. The image appears to be taken at night, as there are streetlights on either side of the road.

The answer to your question is no, the road is not an on-off ramp. The crosswalk in the middle of the road indicates that it is a pedestrian crossing, and the lack of cars and pedestrians suggests that it is not an on-off ramp.</s>
