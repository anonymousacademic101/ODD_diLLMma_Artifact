The image shows a dark and empty road at night. There are no cars or other vehicles on the road, and the only light comes from the headlights of the car driving down the road. The road appears to be straight and flat, with no obstacles or hazards in sight. There are no signs or markings on the road, indicating that it is not a restricted lane for buses or bicycles. Therefore, the answer is NO.</s>
