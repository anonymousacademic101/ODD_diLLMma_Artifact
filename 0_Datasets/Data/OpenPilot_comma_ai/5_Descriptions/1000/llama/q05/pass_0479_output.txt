The image shows a car driving down a city street at night. The car is parked on the side of the road, with its headlights shining on the pavement. There are no other cars or pedestrians visible in the image.

The answer to your question is NO, there are no restricted lanes for buses or bicycles on the road we are driving. The road appears to be a typical city street with two lanes for cars and a sidewalk for pedestrians.</s>
