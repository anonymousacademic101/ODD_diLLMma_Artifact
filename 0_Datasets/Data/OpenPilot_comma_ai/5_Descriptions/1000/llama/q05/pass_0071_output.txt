The image shows a street at night with cars parked on both sides of the road. There are no pedestrians or other vehicles visible in the image. The road appears to be well-lit, with streetlights on both sides of the road. There are no traffic signs or signals visible in the image.

The image does not show any restricted lanes, such as those for buses or bicycles. The road appears to be open to all types of traffic, including cars, buses, and bicycles.

Therefore, the answer to the question is NO, there are no restricted lanes on the road.</s>
