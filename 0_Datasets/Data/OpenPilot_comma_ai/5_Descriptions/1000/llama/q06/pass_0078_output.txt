The image shows a group of cars driving down a dark road at night. The headlights of the cars are on, and the taillights of the cars are visible in the distance. There are no other vehicles visible in the image.

The road appears to be straight and flat, with no construction or obstacles in the way. The sky is dark and cloudy, with no visible stars or other celestial bodies. The only light source is from the headlights of the cars and the taillights of the cars in the distance.

Therefore, the answer to the question is NO, there is no construction on the road.</s>
