The image shows a crosswalk with white stripes on a dark street at night. The light from the street lamps illuminates the crosswalk, but the rest of the street is dark. There are no other cars or pedestrians in the image. The camera was not obstructed, covered, or damaged by mud, ice, snow, excessive paint or adhesive products. Therefore, the answer is NO.</s>
