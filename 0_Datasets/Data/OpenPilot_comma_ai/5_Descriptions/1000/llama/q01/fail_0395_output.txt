The image shows a street at night with no cars or pedestrians in sight. There are streetlights on both sides of the road, casting a dim glow on the asphalt. The sky is dark and cloudy, with a few stars visible in the distance. There is no other light source visible in the image. Therefore, the camera was not obstructed, covered, or damaged by mud, ice, snow, excessive paint or adhesive products.</s>
