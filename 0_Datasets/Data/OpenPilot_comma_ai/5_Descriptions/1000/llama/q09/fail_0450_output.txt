The image you provided shows a street with a crosswalk and cars parked on the side of the road. It appears to be nighttime, as there are streetlights on the side of the road and the sky is dark. The light from the streetlights illuminates the crosswalk and the cars parked on the side of the road, but the rest of the image is dark.

The answer to your question is NO, the road is not hilly. The image shows a flat road with a crosswalk and cars parked on the side of the road. There are no hills or mountains visible in the image.</s>
