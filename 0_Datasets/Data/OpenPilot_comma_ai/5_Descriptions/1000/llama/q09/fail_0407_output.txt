The image is a green grassy field with a small pond in the center. There is a small tree on the left side of the image and a large tree on the right side. The sky is dark and there are no other objects in the image.

The road we are driving on is not hilly. It appears to be a flat, grassy field with a small pond in the center. There are small trees on either side of the road, but they do not appear to be hilly. The sky is dark and there are no other objects in the image, so it is not possible to determine if the road is hilly or not.</s>
