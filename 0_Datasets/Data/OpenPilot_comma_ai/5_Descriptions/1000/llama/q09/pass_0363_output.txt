The image shows a car driving down a winding road with hills in the background. The car is driving on the right side of the road, and there are trees and bushes on either side of the road. The sky is blue and there are clouds in the distance.

Is the road we are driving on hilly?

NO, the road is not hilly. It is a winding road with hills in the background, but the road itself is flat and straight.</s>
