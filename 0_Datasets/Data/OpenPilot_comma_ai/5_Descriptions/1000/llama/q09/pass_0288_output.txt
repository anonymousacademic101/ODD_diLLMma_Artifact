The image shows a dark, empty road at night with no cars or other vehicles visible. There are no streetlights or other sources of light on the road, and the only illumination comes from the headlights of the car driving down the road. The road is straight and flat, with no curves or bends in sight. The sky is dark and cloudy, with no stars or other celestial bodies visible. The only sound is the hum of the car's engine as it drives down the road.

Is the road we are driving on hilly?
