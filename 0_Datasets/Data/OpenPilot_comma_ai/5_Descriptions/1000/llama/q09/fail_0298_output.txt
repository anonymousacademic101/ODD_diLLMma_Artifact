The image shows a car driving down a winding road with hills in the background. The car is driving on the left side of the road, and there are trees and houses visible in the distance. The sky is clear and sunny, and there are no other vehicles visible on the road.

The answer to your question is NO, the road is not hilly. The hills are visible in the background, but they are not close enough to the road to be considered hilly. The road is flat and straight, and there are no other features that would indicate that it is hilly.</s>
