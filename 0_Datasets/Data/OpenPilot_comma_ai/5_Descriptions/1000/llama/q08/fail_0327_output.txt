Yes, the road we are driving on is narrow and winding. There are several cars parked on the side of the road, including a white SUV and a black sedan. The SUV has a bumper sticker on the front that reads, "I'm not lazy, I'm just conserving energy." The sedan has a bumper sticker on the back that reads, "I'm not a morning person, I'm just a night owl."</s>
