The image shows two cars parked on the side of the road at night. The car on the left is parked at an angle, while the car on the right is parked parallel to the road. There are no other cars or pedestrians visible in the image.

Is the road we are driving on narrow and winding?

NO, the road is not narrow and winding. The cars are parked on the side of the road and there are no other cars or pedestrians visible in the image.</s>
