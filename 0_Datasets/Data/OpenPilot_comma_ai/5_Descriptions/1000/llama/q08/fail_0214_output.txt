The image is of a street at night with streetlights on either side of the road. There is a parked car on the left side of the road and a tree on the right side. The road is empty and there are no pedestrians or other vehicles in sight.

Is the road we are driving on narrow and winding?

NO, the road is not narrow and winding. It is a straight road with streetlights on either side.</s>
