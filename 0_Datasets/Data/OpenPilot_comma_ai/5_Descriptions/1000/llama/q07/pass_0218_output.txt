The image shows a dark road with streetlights on both sides. There are no cars or other vehicles visible in the image. The sky is dark and there are no stars visible. The image is taken at night, as evidenced by the streetlights and the darkness of the sky.

The image does not show any extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight into the camera. The streetlights are the only source of light in the image, and they are not particularly bright. The darkness of the sky and the lack of any other sources of light suggest that the image was taken at night.

Therefore, the answer to the question is NO. There are no extremely bright lights from oncoming headlights or direct sunlight into the camera in this image.</s>
