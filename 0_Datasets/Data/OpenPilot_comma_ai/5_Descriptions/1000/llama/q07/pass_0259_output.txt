The image is a black and white photograph of a dark, empty road at night. There are no streetlights or other sources of light visible in the image, and the only illumination comes from the headlights of a car driving down the road in the distance. The image is taken from the perspective of someone standing on the side of the road, looking out into the darkness.</s>
