Yes, there are bright lights from oncoming headlights in the image. The headlights of the cars on the left side of the road are shining brightly, while the headlights of the cars on the right side of the road are not shining as brightly. This is because the sun is shining directly on the cars on the left side of the road, while the cars on the right side of the road are in the shade.</s>
