# Setup Documentation

This section contains essential setup instructions for the tools used in our study: openpilot and MiniGPT4. Each folder (`OpenPilot_Setup` and `MiniGPT4_Setup`) includes detailed READMEs to guide you through the setup process.

## Openpilot Setup
- **Purpose:** [Openpilot](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot), our base Driving Automation System openpilot, was given data the `0_Datasets` folder. The steering angle produced was then used to identify both passing and failing inputs.
- **Setup Instructions:** For detailed setup steps, please refer to the README in the `OpenPilot_Setup` folder.

Here is an example of openpilot whose setup is described in `2023_03` running on data from the comma.ai 2k19 dataset.

## MiniGPT4 Setup
- **Overview:** We used [MiniGPT4](https://github.com/Vision-CAIR/MiniGPT-4), commit X. MiniGPT4 integrates a vision encoder with a pretrained ViT, Q-Former, and advanced Vicuna and Llama 2 language models.
- **Custom Usage:** Our study utilized custom code to process large datasets through MiniGPT4 without the GUI. This code is provided for efficiency and scalability.
- **Setup Instructions:** Follow the standard setup guidelines in the MiniGPT4 README and consult our custom instructions for dataset processing in the `MiniGPT4` folder.
